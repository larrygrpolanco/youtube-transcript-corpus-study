you need people like me so you can point
your fingers I say that's the bad guy
well I make
you good you just know how to hide hello
everyone and welcome back I bought a cgc
graded comic book in possibly one of the
worst times to be buying cgc graded
comic books guys I bought something on
eBay and I had to pull the trigger this
is one of the books from my books I'm
going to buy when the comic book Market
crashes and we got one
so I'm going to unbox this thing we're
going to take a look at some of the data
on this book and see what you guys think
all right I have never bought from this
seller before so that's always a risk uh
buying on eBay had some good reviews I
trusted it let's see how it turns
out this is strange Adventures number
180 DC Comics September 1965 the first
appearance of animalan Bernard Buddy
Baker Dave Wood story Carmine Infantino
and George Russo's art carine Infantino
and Murphy Anderson cover 6.5 offwhite
pages so this is a book that if you guys
have followed my channel for any length
of
time you know I've been wanting this one
so this is a tough book to get in any
grade because this isn't really a very
common book at least not to from my
experience and a lot of times this book
does not look great um because one half
of the cover is black and then the other
half of the cover is white including a
huge part of this where it has black on
the
spine uh this is every bit of a 6.5 it
has the QR code on the back so we know
this is a newly encapsulated book book
uh the back of this book looks very very
good this is a nice copy of this book
all right so whenever I'm buying these
books I'm going to show you guys some of
the things that I look up uh beforehand
before I buy anything but before I do
that I'm going to inspect this case to
see if there's been any any
tampering so the first thing I'm going
to check is these pins in the corner and
it's just pathetic that I have to do
this um but these look to be okay and
you know you have to think is this
really a book that uh scammer is going
to
justify um putting another book in there
I I I don't know and this definitely
looks like a
6.5 um yeah so I I think we're we think
we're in good shape as far as that goes
all right so the first thing I do is I
look up the CT number the certification
number on cgcs lookup part of their
website and sure enough strange
Adventures number 180 um 6.5 off-white
pages that is the book in question and
then the grade date is
1019 2022 do now have the high
resolution um shots of the book
so a lot of all these issues kind of go
out the window when we have all of that
put
together um and here we have some
graders notes it's always nice to see
that heavy spine stress lines to the
cover light scuffing to the cover light
tears to cover moderate creasing to
cover um 6.5 29 books and 131 graded
higher and this is where this book
really really shines uh there is only
389 of these that have been
graded uh there is one 9.8 and there
looks to
be I mean there is a few higher than a
6.5 the most common
grade higher than mine would be a 70 39
of them in the 70 so you start getting
into those eights You' got a really
really rare book on your hands but again
the most common grade I usually see of
this book is like a four to a 5 which is
pretty consistent with this data
here I'm going to look at some of the
price
data um I paid
$390 for this book uh plus the shipping
and the
taxes so I think it came out to around
like
425 or 430 the guy had it listed
originally for
420 which even then I would have
probably bought that book for
$420 uh the highest known value of this
book is a
cbcs 9.4 sold in
2016 um and that sold for
$2,390 other sales data we see here
there's there's some raw copies you know
a 7.0
8.5 raw copy sold for $285 but a fine
copy 5.0 6.5 sold for
$314 I never really trust those raw
sales data it's too hard to
tell going over to the lab stuff we see
a 70 sell for
$510 um on November
15th and then we see a 6.5 420 that's me
but I actually got it for
390 and then a 6.0 sold for 350 1026 so
you know I'm right right around you know
market value there nothing crazy I don't
think I got a steal on this book I think
I just I bought this book for what it is
going for right now a 6.5
overtime um in 22 one sold for
$216 another one sold for
$281 2021 it sold for
$312 see this book is like all over the
place back in 2019 it sold for
$389 there's just not enough of these to
have any consistent sales data now if we
go by these
numbers I overpaid for this book um I
bought it for 390 I know it says 420 but
that would be the closest thing it would
be would be from
2019 if we look at the
6os uh there we can see that one of them
sold for
$459 in
2021 the 5 O's right around these
numbers here 40's around 125 12 26
150 7 O's you're looking at
$500 somebody got one for 400 earlier
this
year and then here's some of the 8.0 and
then here's the 9.0 and 9. tws this is
when you're paying over $1,000 for this
book so as far as this book goes I think
I paid what it was worth what you know
what the market value is and or maybe
even a little bit over that this book
just does not come up for sale like when
I went to Heroes con uh earlier this
year I saw a few raw copies of this book
one copy looks similar to this and they
were
asking just a ridiculous amount for this
book so I
totally um just walked away from that
guy's Booth this book is going up on the
wall you're going to be seeing this a
lot I'm happy to this um I think I did
overpay a little bit but that's just the
way the cookie crumbles I really wanted
it guys hope you guys enjoyed this video
