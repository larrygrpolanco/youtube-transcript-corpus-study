differences between the Invincible comic
book and the Animated Series in the
comics Omni man punched Invincible
straight to the city he never killed any
Pilots because there weren't any
politics you almost killed him instead
you saved him so much effort for what
in the comics Invincible never held up
the building after it crashed the moment
he got there Omni man arrived
when Omni man hit him down to the subway
system they landed on the train he never
held him up to it
when Omni man punched him into the ocean
they never crashed on a ship they went
straight into the water
when Omni man punched him to the
mountain there was no one there for the
Avalanche to kill
