turniverse but uh this is a comic shop
up in rhinebeck new york called mega
brain comics i was able to do a quick
tour
quick video also uh picked up some stuff
which we will talk about
i do have to do a voice over though so
i've been i i've been liking to like
actually record and talk while i'm
recording instead of doing a voiceover
unfortunately for this video they had a
lot of music playing and i can't have
music in the background of the video so
i did a voiceover so without further ado
let's go through the tour of the shop
and then we'll talk about what i picked
up
all right guys we are at mega brain
comics in rhinebeck new york
unfortunately i'm going to have to do a
voiceover once i walk in and record the
reason is they have music playing
oh look what we got up there little
frankie ray i'll have to ask about that
book but they have music playing in
there so i i can't have that in my video

well as jeffrey dean morgan

so we're gonna go in here and
unfortunately i'm gonna have to switch
it over to a voice over
[Applause]
[Music]
alright guys so here we go we are
walking into mega brain comics and you
immediately see a lot of trades and our
new releases two racks of new releases
and more trades just a lot of whether
it's hardcover paperback a lot of books
here are some more
we do have some wall books back here yes
you see a hole on the wall that is
something i picked up we'll get into
that later in the video
some toys there are some some more toys
miscellaneous stuff and there's some and
i forgot to record in the display case
under the register there are some slabs
books nothing there that i wanted to
pick up
some magnets and some more odds and ends
miscellaneous kind of stuff
some pokemon stuff
some game board games adult games child
games and some t-shirts
i didn't really look too closely at the
t-shirts actually to see if there's
anything for me
but there are a good variety you got the
lunch boxes up top and then some socks
and again i can't express this enough
just a variety of different stuff for a
comic shop
more books hardcovers
paperback
children's books on the spinner rack
big stuff there
and then you can see on this back wall
again yeah games on the bottom you have
more books on the wall
and more bugs on the shelf here
we're gonna start coming up to the back
issues which you can see on your right
and then right in front of you here's a
rack of funkos
old big stand actually
i didn't look through those either
didn't have a whole lot of time here's
some back issues and then you see a lot
underneath there as well as some vinyl
records
and
more funkos down there i like those
wooden boxes though
more board games
more odds and ends
and here are some back issues i did pull
some stuff out of here that we will go
through again at the end of the video
um unfortunately i wanted to go back and
grab
this and i forgot to
whoops
it happens
and
[Music]
more
books
and toys
and here is the adult section
good sized adult section
and more more trades
and some posters so
guys a little bit of everything and then
to the right there if you could just see
the mad magazines that's a magazine rack
right
here and we've got some handheld games
and here's something a little bit
different a small arcade
in the back of the comic shop
some vintage stuff nothing really newer
oh well paul another paul rudd signature
stay small
you have some pinball
i was actually surprised to see how busy
it was back in the arcade
i didn't think it would be as busy as it
was and like as i was
as i was recording more and more people
just headed back there
and you got to think with some of these
classic games some of the younger kids
have never played them
primal rage oh man
i know some of you guys remember that
and then the next one i know some of you
guys remember popeye
oh man joust
pretty cool stuff now let's go over
what i purchased
all right you guys got a good tour of
this comic shop what's cool is they
actually have an arcade in the back
something you don't see too too often a
lot of miscellaneous stuff i would say
there's probably 50 comics in that store
not trades and stuff like that but
actual
regular back issues and new books i
would say maybe 50 of that store is
comic books maybe not even you guys saw
it you saw the tour so you tell me but i
go i did go in there and i found some
some diamonds in the rough i did spend
about 200 on a few books that i wanted
to talk about i probably could have
spent more and kept digging but i just
spent the day at the fair i was tired i
was ready to go home the kids were
exhausted so without further ado let's
get into this thing all right so first
book i want to talk about was incredible
hulk
330. uh this is mcfarland i believe it's
the first mcfarland on marvel
i'm almost positive i got this for a
good price again 200 for the lot
infinite crisis number three this is
that variance the sketch variant awesome
book very important keep an eye out on
this
good is this jim lee it is jim lee it
looks like jim lee this is jim lee
pencils all right
picked up some x-men stuff do you want
to talk about the x-men yeah pretty much
the rest of the stuff is x-men first
thing i picked up
was x-men 24. you'll probably see this
in an upcoming what not auction or it
already happened and that's it it's gone
um this is probably about a 4-0
again 200 for the whole lot
no discount no deal just this is what i
paid
another silver age x-men it's like a
bronze no
it's on the cusp here x-men number 59
neil adams book here uh
probably about a three five
three oh three five nothing super high
grade
uh let's see only four more books to
talk about here is x-men 239 this is
actually the first mr sinister cover
pairs really really well
with x-men 221 which is the first mr
sinister don't sleep on this book
everything in the hobby has been going
down in price
this one has as well and call me crazy
but i feel like when the x-men do hit
the big screen when they do get a movie
mr sinister is a great potential first
villain we haven't seen him yet in any
of the fox movies he's a great villain
why not enough with the juggernaut we
don't really need magneto in my opinion
right away you can build up to
characters like that give a sinister i
think that would be awesome another
x-men book here x-men 142 the second
half of days of future past
uh this one's actually in pretty good
shape it's probably about a 9-0
could use a press but i would say a 9-0
the sinister is probably like a nine two
to a nine four and doesn't need a press
does have a big dog here a little bit of
a staining but
maybe it's more like an eight
that standing might make it an eight all
right
last but not least the book i felt like
i got the best deal on but
but
needs the most work it does need
significant pressing but when it does
this book will probably hit about an
eight five to a nine o in its current
state i would say it's like a 7-0 again
needs a lot of work
uh this is a hulk 340 we love this cover
guys this is the mcfarland cover it's
been homage i don't know how many times
i think mcfarland's doing a cgc signing
too uh i've seen him sign a lot of these
books my favorite signature though is
actually on the blades you put like todd
and then mcfarlane in the other one uh
great i you know fair book fair price it
does need work the same with the
sinister these things do need pressing i
mean all these books need pressing but
again 200
for the entire lot that was after tax
and all i feel like i did pretty well
and i also feel like there's still more
stuff to find in there i just didn't
have the time to dig dig and dig but i
hope you guys enjoyed the tour of the
shop hope you guys liked what i picked
up
i don't know um
