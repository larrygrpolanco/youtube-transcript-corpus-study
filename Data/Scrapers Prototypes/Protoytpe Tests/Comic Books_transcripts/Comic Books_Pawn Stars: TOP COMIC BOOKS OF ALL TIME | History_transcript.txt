so this is the i think the first print
teenage mutant ninja turtles comic
ninja turtles so you're talking the very
first ninja turtles i'm pretty sure this
is the one i had when i was a kid my mom
kept it so this is the very first one
84 is when it came out who's your
favorite ninja turtle
there was raphael michelangelo you
remind me of
master splinter he was like the rat
ninja boss teacher yeah just like you
the rat ninja boss teacher
okay so tell me how much you want for it
well i saw somewhere
that one of these went for 50 000.
okay so how much do you want for it
uh 60 000. so more than they went for it
this is a sign okay i know there's big
money here if it's a first edition
and it's in great shape you know i don't
know what a signature looks like
um i mean looks like a ninja turtle i
know someone who will definitely know
about this
okay i'm gonna go call him and see if i
can get a hold of him come down here and
take a look at it
okay all right i'm gonna go look for
some pizza where you're going
help customers you know what pizza does
sound kind of good
like i said i met this guy a couple
times he was gracious enough to come
down
kevin eastman hey pleasure to meet you
i'm sorry you're friends with rick
let me get around there hey oh nice to
meet you i love your work thanks is this
your part
yes oh fantastic wow so i've heard the
stories but i might as well hear it from
the horse's mouth
how did this comic actually come about
it really came out of a complete joke
both peter laird and myself wanted to be
jack kirby when we grew up we wanted to
write draw comic books for a living i
was a huge fan of bruce lee and i
figured if bruce lee
was an animal what would be the
stupidest animal i had this idea
did this sketch turtle in a kung fu pose
mask on nunchucks strapped to his arm
and i put it on piece dust and i said
this is going to be the next big thing
he got a laugh i drew four turtles these
were different weapons and we said
this is the dumbest thing we've ever
seen
[Laughter]
so the big question is is this a first
printing yes it's definitely a first
printing so what's the difference
between the first printing and the
second printing
the second printing was a little bit
lighter and more of a pinkish tone to it
so i definitely know this is the first
printing just because the deep rich
redness of it so
my signature's undeniable because ever
since the very very beginning i always
wanted to make it different than
anybody else the way they were signing
the comics so i added a turtle head on
each one so this is definitely my
signature
all right do you know what these things
go for
i've seen them range you know all over
the map price-wise you have no idea what
it's worth
no idea what it's worth all right but
it's legit
that's your signature yes 100 okay at
least we know that and we'll figure out
a price later
we'll have lunch soon dude i'll call
somebody up and we'll get this figured
out look forward to it thanks guys
see ya all right sorry to do this to you
but when
we're talking a lot of money i sometimes
have a lot of people look at things
let me call one more guy and have take a
look at it all right i'm sure this guy
can figure out a price on it
so give me like 15 minutes okay i'm
really excited to see what the experts
say knowing that kevin said it was a
first edition and that was his signature
i'm hoping maybe i can make a little bit
more than what i was coming in for
so we got here a first edition
first printing teenage mutant ninja
turtles signed by kevin eastman
you had this when you were a kid when i
was a kid yeah it's my original comic
book
i was there when this book came out i
laughed at this book
i didn't care about this book i didn't
buy it became the biggest thing in the
world
there's only three thousand of these
things printed just for some context
x-men 300 000 print run spidey 250
000 print run so it's super rare then
it is but what we're gonna have to do is
we're gonna have to take a look at it
first
[Music]
let's have a look at the condition of
this book
you got one little tiny ding there and
then oh what do we have here
a couple little like a light stain
now if you're aware of grading it
usually like an 8-0
just called a vf which is a very fine
from what i can see
this is a line four so this is a special
book i don't know how you kept it in
this condition for so long i don't know
if you had it in some weird room
floating in the air
did a great job now you want the good
news hmm
they can press that little floor out oh
wow
there's a possibility that you can get
this book to a nine six
oh wow okay okay so we need to take that
into consideration
so what's it worth a nine-four straight
right now
11k and that's including
his signature yes that's including the
signature okay so how much more would
this bring if it was a nine
six we're talking
minimum twenty thousand dollars okay
but in current condition retail value
eleven thousand yes
okay thanks man thank you very much all
right guys yeah
okay it'll retail for 11. i mean i'll
give you 8 grand for it
oh i mean obviously i wanted to go 60 i
mean
would you go like 30
the chance that it can still go to 20.
well i guess maybe that makes
zero economic sense ah all right what
about
15 there's a chance you could make 20
off of it
yeah no no no i'm a businessman not a
gambler
you know what i i think i'll just try to
get it pressed and see what it comes
back and then
kind of go from there okay but
changed your mind 8 000. all right
thanks
i'm really shocked that it came down so
low so what i'll probably do is
get it pressed and then just hold on to
it and hopefully it'll go up to what
it's really valued at
hey how's it going good how's it going i
have this amazing comic book i would
like for you guys to check out
let me see it yeah don't you touch that
why you know what this is spider-man
uh this isn't just like number one
spider-man this is the first time
anybody saw spider-man oh
you have one of the like holy grails of
comic books
where did you get this uh my brother and
i about 20 years ago
we bought a collection of comic books
and this was just
just in there that's amazing oh
you're like the guy who buys the uh
handy warhol at a garage sale
yeah pretty much i came to the pawn shop
today to sell one of the most amazing
comic books that's ever been
i'm gonna ask sixteen thousand dollars i
think if they'll see the potential of
this i mean everybody knows spider-man
with all the movies
i think this is a great opportunity for
them to get this out
well that's real man i'll be blown away
because the amazing spider-man was the
number one
in the series this is like the
introduction to that it was kind of like
the comic books version of a tv pilot
yeah you know they they did it they
tested it out they gave the whole
backstory
and i think we all know how well
spiderman has caught on
well this was a whole new era for comic
books it's hard to exaggerate how
important this thing is
i mean this is where the entire mega
franchise of spider-man began
and to collectors it's practically
priceless i could probably charge people
just to look at it
so do you have any particular amount
you're looking for on it
yeah i'd like to sell it for 16 000.
for a comic book for this comic book
um you know it might be worth it comic
books had their heyday where they were
going
for obscene amounts of money and then
they dropped
do you mind if i have a buddy of mine
come down and take a look at it he can
give me an idea of what it's worth
that'd be great i mean to be quite
honest with you i don't even want to be
responsible for taking this thing out of
the cover let me give them a call and
i'll be right back that'd be great
this is one of the most valuable comic
books ever but price tag depends on
condition
so i'm gonna need to bring in the big
guns to help me out on this one
amazing fantasy 15 man fantastic i've
seen one
in a 9.6 condition go for over a million
dollars
that's exactly why i didn't want you to
touch it
[Laughter]
so what are your concerns about the book
corey i can tell the difference between
a one and a ten
but i can't tell the difference between
a four and a seven yeah
it's apparent we see some chipping here
which is very common with the paper they
used back then
it's really tough to duplicate that let
me just make sure we have all the pages
here
this is such a classic page here high
school setting
peter parker he's midtown high's
professional wallflower
so they're kind of poking fun of him
everything looks intact doesn't seem
like we're missing any pages
that's great man what do you think on a
scale of one to ten
now i'd put this in the five range very
good to fine condition
closer to the six to seven thousand
dollar range
really that's way way less than
where i would put it um just you got a
lot of issues on the cover and the cover
is everything
the million million-dollar book it would
have had none of this shipping
no stamp it had no staining no binding
issues
no creases right on johnny i appreciate
it
all right cool i was really shocked when
he said seven thousand dollars a
condition of fine would be worth a whole
lot more than seven thousand dollars
what's your bottom number on the comic i
i mean
i was saying 16 and i would go
13 13. i mean the most i'm gonna pay is
seven
i mean so we've got a huge gap there i
can tell you from my experience
this is the worst time in history to be
selling comic books
i could go 11. you know with the
condition issues that it has
it's just not there for me all right
bottom line ten thousand
you know man i hate to lose the comic
over 3 000 bucks but
i've got to stick at seven sorry man all
right
appreciate it i would love to have the
superpower of kind of
helping someone see things clearly i
think they would have realized this is
worth a whole lot more than seven
thousand dollars
a guy came in with a superman versus
muhammad ali comic book from the 1970s
i'm pretty sure i'll be able to find a
buyer i'm just not sure how rare it is
or how much it will be worth
so i've asked johnny to come down and
check it out so here we go man superman
versus muhammad ali
that's one of my personal favorites man
that's awesome i mean you got
muhammad ali bigger than life at the
time and then superman of course
and then this is one of the oversized
books so 250 and that was
quite a bit for a comic book back then
comics were huge in the 70s and
superman comics are a huge demand just
recently there was a superman comic that
sold for over 3 million
the storyline was incredible it brought
some humanity to superman
in the comic he loses the fight and
they're carrying him out in a stretcher
which if you're a superman reader i mean
you don't see that kind of stuff
this cover here was done by neil adams
and he did such an awesome job on this
one here
but look at all the faces in here look
at jackson 5 right there
you have cher you have martin luther
king even i think stevie wonder
is on the cover oh really they did the
drawing and then they got the permission
from a lot of actors and
the ones they didn't get permission from
they put like mustaches on them
[Music]
all right johnny so now that you've
nerded out on me what do you think it's
actually worth
well you have a lot of superman guys
that go nuts for this and then you got a
lot of sports guys
okay i mean to see muhammad ali and
superman any guy in the world want to
put that in their man cave or
in their room somewhere then all your
pages are there
condition of it looks great i mean i
would say good to very good condition
okay i'd see no problem if you had to
see your shop
[Music]
pulling 150 175 okay
johnny my man appreciate you coming down
i'm fine thank you sir thank you again
if corey's able to buy this comic club
no problem moving it because there's a
big market for superman comics
there's a lot of people collect sports
memorabilia who would go after this
being
you got muhammad ali and superman bigger
than life
are you wanting 300 but i got to go with
him and i'll give you 100 bucks for it
um i think it's a little low only
because i mean
it's not just superman you also have
muhammad ali
two very well-known figures um
superman's actually doing a movie very
soon with batman
i think this would move very fast um
would you do
225 let me explain to you something
buddy i'm a pawn shop i'm not a comic
book store you know uh
you might be in the wrong place trying
to sell it i'll give you a hundred bucks
for it
um could you do 135
135
all right man i'll do 135 you got to do
great thank you all right let's leave
this here come with me ready just
paperwork okay
i feel pretty good i'll probably take my
wife out to a nice dinner
and then probably lose all of a gambling
either one whatever comes first
my dad gave this to me and he's hoping
that i'll pay for my dress for her
wedding
star wars battle on the death star i
really don't know
that much about star wars i'm kind of a
superhero fan but i'm getting married
and my dress is about four thousand
dollars so hopefully the comic book will
pay for it
how much are you looking to get for this
um i'm hoping somewhere around four 000
that's how much my dress is worth
and i really can't afford that so
i mean it could be worth a lot of money
it is star wars it is a comic
so i actually would like to call two
people down here okay one of them will
be able to tell us about the comic book
and how much it's worth
and the other one will be able to tell
us who signed these and
that's really even harrison ford's
signature did your dad's friend sign
this in his bedroom and
give it to your dad probably i mean it's
pretty rare you see you know any kind of
star wars signatures on comics
but funny enough back in 1977 trying to
promote star wars now
imagine this okay you have mark hamill
who was luke you have carrie fisher who
is princess leia
have harrison ford who played han solo
at a canadian
comic book store this is ford beautiful
neat
flowing it's sign and cursive but it
looks almost printed out to me
and here i'm starting to see that
especially this f it's literally the
same transition points he ends almost
the same
way up here is
mark hamill andy luke skywalker of
course and then
carrie fisher who was princess leia so
you had the three main ones on there
awesome all right so the signatures are
good
well i'll tell you this is genuine
harrison ford carrie fisher mark hamill
they all signed that piece
so dad's friend didn't write those
autographs in his bedroom no
all right this is a great piece it
captures them right when they did star
wars you do not see the stuff
well how much are they worth no i don't
grade comics and that's kind of not my
thing but
based on the fact that the signatures
are just really
nice and vintage in the same pen this is
something that's worth
the 3 000 range that would be
awesome well the signatures that were on
the comic
having them together on a piece isn't
exceedingly rare
but having them at the same event and
especially in 1977 when star wars came
out
now that makes it ultra rare oh wow star
wars three
yes this is her comic all right
in 77 marvel was trying to do a price
increase
so they increased in select areas
uh from 30 cents to 35 cents so if you
find a one through four with a 35
price variant the value just goes insane
is there just not as many of
now they're rare they're hard to find
especially on the star wars one through
four
this is a regular 30 cent and first i
really ought to
make sure it's whole it should be eight
pages to the center fold then
eight after it's in nice shape
no tears no creases okay
and good news is it's complete awesome
i think it's about a 9-4 so near-mint
comic itself without the
signatures would be worth
about 50
but if it was a 35-cent comma it would
be like three thousand dollars
and what's the difference in them is
there a five right that's it
yeah oh man i'm sorry
breaking my heart someone gave me a
marker
that's crazy yeah i think i've heard
everything i need to know they got it at
any time
nice to see you good luck take care well
you know based on what paul said about
the comic book it really doesn't change
the value too much
thank you you got it he said it was
about a 50 comic book but still
really your whole value there is for the
signatures and that's kind of what
makes it so special
well you said you wanted 4 000 and you
were trying to sell it for a dress
honestly i'm not going to be able to get
you up to that 4 000.
what about three times
it's just that's more than it's worth
those guys are really good at what they
do though and i'm sure it is worth three
so
would you take 1500 for it i'm not
dropping below three
i kind of want what it's worth out of it
i really want that dress
um
i don't see myself paying any more than
1500 for it
maybe try out a couple comic stores
thank you have a good day you too
i'm positive i can get more out of it
somewhere else but
if my dad's friend had spent 35 cents
other than 30 on it i would have gotten
an extra 3 000
off of it life sucks
all right what do we have here i have a
mad comic
number one that i'd like you to take a
look at that's
pretty damn cool hoping you'd think that
have you ever read it
comic books aren't really my thing i was
more interested in the mad art
it's cool i mean it's just really full
of that you know
pre-teen boy silly humor yeah i can't
believe you didn't read this
i'm not a boy so maybe that explains it
i am selling this mad comic issue number
one
because it was purchased as part of a
collection and
the comic itself was not what i was
really interested in
i'm hoping to get thousand five hundred
dollars for this comic
i would use that money to purchase uh
other pieces of art that i'm interested
in
this is extremely cool rarely am i
in awe of something i had a subscription
to mad magazine when i was a kid
and this is mad comment this isn't even
mad magazine it's neat that it's a comic
because eventually it turned into a
magazine format because
in the 50s the government was like
getting all weird about comic books and
you know that they were screwing up kids
minds magazines weren't scrutinized the
way comics were
exactly when it was first released mad
was more than a comic book
it was a satire on current events it
wasn't afraid to get
really close to the edge just like today
i'm assuming you want to sell this yes
how much you want for it
i'm asking 2 500. okay i have no idea if
that's a good price
um i know they go for good money you
know and i feel like this is in very
good condition
and if you're a mad collector you want
to have
mad number one i actually have a friend
who grades these things do you mind if i
call him and get him down here no that
sounds great
okay hang out a few minutes i'll be
right back
i'm fine with an expert coming in
because i'm just as curious
to find out what the grade of this
particular comic would be
wow
that's awesome oh it's mad comic that's
the weird thing i uh i've never seen one
this old
at issue 23 they become the magazine
they were trying to get away from the
comics code
so the comic book code authority was
that like a
government regulation or yeah dr
frederick wortham
he was on this witch hunt saying that
comic books were destroying america's
youth
wertham had this huge senate hearing and
the comics code authority got instituted
the publisher of
mad changed it to a magazine format so
they could skirt the
comics code authority so what do you
think
that was very nice
got some fingerprints on the back
and the interior front cover also
covers a little bit tanning you have
some creases here along the spine
a little tanning on the pages looks a
little cream
here let me take a look at that black
it's a beautiful looking book so grade
wise it's a
on a scale of one to ten it's around a
six point five or seven
i mean what do you think it's worth i
would put the value at about
two thousand dollars well thanks man i
appreciate it
anytime rick this would be a great buy
for the shop if rick can get this for a
good
price it'll sell quickly so what's your
best price
two thousand uh well there's nothing in
it for me at two thousand
i have to make money off it okay so let
me give you 1300 bucks for it
i would say
1800 there's no money for me that
i give you 1400 anything after that
doesn't make sense
the lowest i can go is 1500.
have you changed your mind give me a
call okay thanks thank you very much
i wasn't able to sell the comic today
but i will go home
i'll put it online and i'm confident
that i will get a price of 1500
or better what do you have here
i brought you bob hope his original
comic from 1950.
hey rick what check this out
it's a bob hope comic book
that's pretty cool do you know who bob
hope is the price is right
no that's bob barker this is bob hope
different old bop
you know bob hope and bing crosby like
jerry lewis and
dean martin who like harold and kumar
okay all right okay
[Laughter]
bob hope he was a pretty amazing guy he
entertained troops in world war
ii korea vietnam he was the only
honorary
veteran in the united states because he
did so much stuff for the uso lived to
be 100 years old
100 yep when he was in a movie it made
money
he was so popular he had his own comic
book three
bob hope was an absolute hollywood
legend he was in over 70 films and he
hosted the academy awards
19 times i'm just afraid anyone under
the age of 50
doesn't really know who he is so um
where did you get this i actually got
this on an online auction
okay well it looks in relatively good
shape assuming you want to sell it
yes how much you want for it i believe
it might be worth about 500
i don't know how collectible bob hope is
tell you the truth i just have no idea
what the demand would be for this due to
the fact that it's not an action hero
it's bob hope it's a little weird yeah
okay
do you mind if i have someone look at it
that'd be great i have a friend in town
yeah he grades comics for a living he
knows what he's doing
i'll be right back i'll give a call and
um we'll go from there
great i'm glad an expert's coming in to
look at the comic
just to be sure that it's all there and
to get their opinion on the grade
ah about pope number one i mean the
whole weird thing is
it's bob hope it's not like he's a
superhero
yeah in the 50s superheroes were going
down
they they weren't as popular and so what
dc started to do is license
celebrities they did stories in here
that would relate to some of the movies
coming out
so they kind of did some cross marketing
there okay
the bob hope comic ran from issue one
from 1950
all the way to 1968 i mean 18 years for
for a continual run on a comic is pretty
great
so what's the great on this thing all
right well
it looks pretty nice it's got a few
creases
tear along the spine there doesn't look
restored at all
a little bit of tanning that chip out at
the top right
you know i think cgc would give it about
a 6-0 the big question is what's it
worth
that would put a certified 6-0 price at
around
600 that's the price but are they easy
to sell
i mean most people my age we we know bob
barker
more than we know bob hope i told you so
you're calling me old
no you are old i'm just stating a fact
anyway i think it's 600 you can't go
wrong
okay thanks man i really appreciate it
got it rick any time all right good to
see you again see you next time take
care
people love first issues issue ones
always
are collectible how fast rick will sell
it
i really can't say i know he gets a lot
of foot traffic
through the shop and and i think he
should be able to move it
so what's your best price of this well
if it's worth six and i'm only asking
five
i hope that's a great deal for bob i
think bob would say the price is gonna
have to be right
[Laughter]
i mean your problem here is it's bob
hope
i mean unless you're over 50 no one
really knows who bob hope is anymore
i think it's gonna be a tough sell i'd
give you 300 bucks for it
how about 400
i'll give you 3.25 and i won't go up
anymore i mean it literally is it
congratulations well thanks man i
appreciate it the price is right
[Laughter]
all right let's go write it up i believe
it was a win-win for that particular
price
i'm gonna give the money to my wife and
i have no idea what the hell she's gonna
do with it
[Laughter]
what are you laughing at this bob hope
comic the bob hope comic book hey you
know bob hope
he's like did new year's eve for like
years and years and years he's got the
airport named after him in california
that was dick clark's rocking eve
it's not dick clark international
airport i know it's bob hope
international airport
never mind i'm just telling you those
old comedians have nothing on the new
wave of comedians
why is it that all you guys ever want to
do is argue with me
you're always saying i refuse to learn
anything i learned that bob hope and
dick clark aren't the same person
no kidding maybe you'll grow a brain one
day coming from the guy reading comics
old bob hope comics
you
