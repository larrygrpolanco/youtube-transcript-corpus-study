so I picked up a comic book collection
three long boxes one of them about half
full um and I thought there was a
possibility of some big keys but not
quite just missed it let's take a look
at what we did get up next on this video
from bronville
[Music]
comics
hello panelists this is Jim from
Bronzeville Comics coming to you with
another video before we get started
please like comment subscribe do all
that great stuff really appreciate it
and also um follow us on the other
socials Instagram Bron _ Comics whatnot
bronze _ Comics Link in the description
if you've not yet signed on to what not
what not you can do that and get $10
worth your first purchase also in the
description is a link to my eBay store
as well as my
email so I um I left the flea market uh
a couple weeks ago um and responded to a
Facebook Marketplace ad from somebody uh
and it was kind of interesting because
they did have a mutual friend and that's
one of the things that gives you maybe a
little bit of assurance that this is a
real person you're dealing with on eBay
um and so I headed up there it was a
little bit of a drive and um I decided
to check it
out now this was a fellow who cleans out
uh um like storage units cleans out
houses and he knows a little bit about
Comics not really much into modern
Comics as he said he's more of a
Spider-Man collector Silver age
Spider-Man collector so um that's kind
of what uh he collects and he didn't
really look through the boxes or know
what was in there and he was just trying
to move them along
so I looked through and he had sent the
from the
pictures there were some possibilities
based on the error and I was looking and
you'll see what happens as we go through
the boxes that
I was this close to some big keys but uh
evidently they had already been taken
out not by him I at least according to
what he told me and I I believe that was
the case um probably by either the
regional owner or maybe the original
owner had somebody look through it
before um he had gotten to it so let's
jump
in so I just picked up this
collection um small collection
three long
boxes the uh guy I got it from cleans
out storage things he knows a little bit
about Comics not much about modern
Comics um I had from the pictures I saw
I had hopes of something but seems like
missed it by that
much so let's dig into these
boxes and see what we
got now so here's the first box this is
the like half fil box
so we have some late Uncanny
X-Men uh I'm not even sure where to put
these a bunch of Legends of the Dark
Knight now most of these are really um
not these are like there's there really
no keys in this run there I've always
said there actually some good reads in
this Legends of the Dark Knight
run
but nothing think really key ific
there's a little bit of the No Man's
Land
crossover but
nothing nothing really that
great nice Joker cover
there warlock Iron
Man warlord
book
Wolfman St Wolfman
5 weapon a
Days of Future
[Music]
now be nice if some of these web spinner
Spider-Man wore the Superman a free
comic book day number
two wild
cats that doesn't have a bag and board
oops gosh darn it sorry about
that little of
power some
X-Men
334 Savage Wolverine
one Savage
Wolverine what this
is excuse me uncanny X Force number
one Shield number two
Justice League America 71 War the
Superman put a a couple of runs together
that would be not so bad this seems a
little water damaged there's a
receipt Gamers Gambit I guess that's the
store we bought it
at
Cy X Force again I have to do some
research on this
title ultimate 6 and you'll see I think
the Hallmark of this collection is
almost that we're
almost did
okay did okay but we almost did really
well um for fortunately this box is
driving me crazy now look at this yeah
we got ultimate Fallout
6 ultimate extinct Extinction ultimate
Fallout
five and that's pretty much where it
dance I didn't unless I'm going to be
surprised this might be a key I'm going
to have to look up some of these later
3400 era Uncanny X-Men
books
nice so this yeah this box certainly not
full I want to spend a little more
time going through
this
Overkill I guess this is a gamer
thing Legends put those to the side with
the funny size stuff
X-Men Uncanny
X-Men CNY xman versus x23 see notice
there's no
450 59
460
461 469 then we jump into like a new
stand 195 that look to be in pretty good
shape this
is uh the first
Nimrod doesn't look like you got a
little schut there 98 Contender but
still pretty decent
condition another new to 28 Rogue
one
Spiderman maxman
X-Men 277 X-Men
260
230 a nice
uh plastic
dividers those could be
useful vodoo number
[Music]
one Kenny X-Men
490
492
495
526 more Legends of the Dark
Knight The Dark Knight does that an
annual
yeah The Dark
Knight quite a bit of
that joker
cover uncanny Avengers one two three
four okay ultimate six number
four uncanny and
humans trying to figure out how to hold
this best more Legends of the Dark
Knight I'm trying to remember if all of
them had this logo at the time I don't
think that's a multipack logo that's
just a logo on these
books number of things on bag board a
lot of Batman Legends of the Dark Knight
I kind of flip through these pretty
quickly because I know there's not a
whole lot
of just run these as a couple Lots this
one is a good one this Brian Bolan cover
Legend of Dark Knight
50
embossed that's probably that might be
the best book in The Run number
seven and what the legend of the Dark
Knight series I enjoyed reading it
because usually it was not in current
continuity usually kind of fleshed out
past stories and they were usually
Standalone three or four issue story
lines 12 13 annual 1
14 15 22 there something behind
that 15 16
22 annual
two what's
that 35 36 37
38 160 161 I might be missing a couple
of these
issues that somehow either didn't make
it home or just got mixed up with other
stuff 73 74
77 78 that's a cool bgirl cover
85
88
89 190
192
193 number two number
three 127 it's kind of all over the
place 128
129 Green Arrow or like early Green
Arrow story across over the I think this
is all
legends 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39
49 150 151 so nothing terribly special
in that box let's move on to box number
two okay let's take a look at this this
second box w box uh this is kind of a
Batman labeled box we can see here says
Batman um so we do have Batman adventur
7 the poly bag has been opened and this
is why it's called the almost collection
we have
nine we have
11 and not no 12 uh Dark Knight annual
number one new 52 then some annuals from
the blood lines story line here's this
is so typical you have gotam Knights two
numbers one three and four not issue
number two so it's
incomplete Batman Chronicles Journey
Into Night Batman black and white number
one green arrow
70 something behind that Batman Jazz
numbers what is it two and
three even worse it's one and three I
can understand one being missing with
why two um Batman
Chronicles Batman annual more Batman
adventures
14 um
22
23 24
25 I like this Batman 66 number one like
all red cover big fan of Batman
1966 uh
441 and then it's in spurts there are
some issues but not like runs
464
then we jump back to
449
452
53
55 57 and that's a news
stand so we're g to put that to the side
61
62 63
66
69 70 72
73 74
76 78 then we jump to the 600s 693
697
699 then we're into Detective Comics at
this point let's just move a little
closer and right about
there there we go think that'll work
well detective
596
597 6 2
630
678 694

one this is I think the third appearance
of Harley in continuity
737
832 New 52 number
one number two number three number four

jumped to 22 23 24

variants have any value 945
948
950 51 and
52 then we have this thing it says
Batman Beyond universe and there's
nothing there Catwoman 11 Batman Gotham

place
69
70
71 72 Batman and The Outsiders number

one Robin annual
4 Robin not a new stand 153 149 111
130 Batman Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
one and two secret origin special this
it's a bowan cover that has a little bit
of value I think then secret Origins
number six Golden Age Batman and Halo
this I I actually really like this story
um by Roy Thomas Marshall Rogers and
Terry Austin I am a big fan of Marshall
Rogers and they this is basically
telling the story of the Golden Age
Batman this comes right after or right
right after crisis um and what they did
they did it in a number of these secret
Origins they'd have a newer character
and then a golden age character and they
kind of did the origins of the Golden
Age characters more or less in the order
that they appeared more or less um so
this this that's a pretty cool story uh
Nightwing and Johnny Thunder I guess
they were interested in the bat
characters Batgirl number annual number
one back off 39 that's from the
Cassandra Kane era 57 this does have a
little bit of value
um this is a who did the cover is this
archam this is an archam cover that's a
Stephanie Brown Batgirl got to put that
to the side I know because I just like
came across a copy of that U Batgirl
Batgirl

26 27 and
28 let to go through all of those first

of these three I'm going to see if
there's a little bit of run of these
some of these books there might be runs
I'm not sure
six

eight nine and
10 and then I'll pull this last batch
out one of the nice things about this
box nine and 10 um is this collection

111
121
122
124 X-Men
480 and 481 and that does it for the
collection so take a look I'll pull out
the the best of the keys uh um again
couple of near
misses so we'll see what we can get out
of this this collection so you saw me go
through the long boxes there um and as I
said this was the almost collection uh
the seller was a guy I said he cleans
out um storage units and what have you
and houses and he more focuses on games
and toys and that kind of thing and he
said he really isn't no modern Comics so
I started looking through the boxes I'm
like no no so a lot of the big keys were
were missing they could have been there
but there was still some good stuff left
behind and he said nobody had touched
the books since he picked them up so
perhaps the original
owner had kept some better books had
gone through and picked out the best
stuff and kind of left the the rest in
the storage unit I'm not sure maybe this
was somebody that sold at flea markets
or something it's it's hard to say but I
did pick out some keys but we're talking
about almost right so we had Batman
adventur
seven nine okay
11 no 12 we had ultimate Fallout six and
ultimate Fallout five and that was it
and even this and this was a mistake I
made in going through the boxes and it
um this this I I looked at this book
it's Howard the Duck number one and it's
from 2014 but it's not the first
appearance of gwenpool it's the other
Howard the Duck number one from 2014
that has the first appearance in
gwenpool that that particular cover has
like other folks around Howard um so
yeah they're both from
2014 um so let's take a look at there
nothing huge in here but some nice you
know decent books Uncanny X-Men 184 this
is the first appearance of
Forge
450 was missing but we had 451 which is
uh I guess the second appearance of x23
in X-Men continuity or in the X-Men
title Legends of the Batman Legends of
the Dark Knight number 50 this classic
Brian Bolan Jo ER cover it's a uh foily
embossed deal this was not bad this is
um
Batman and the Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles number
one and number
two and those are fairly recent but both
pretty decent books New Avengers 4 which
is the first appearance of Maria
Hill totally awesome Hulk number one the
first amadas Cho as
Hulk
this Mighty Captain Marvel number one
Scotty Young
cover this is an interesting book um
it's incredible incredible Hulk number
49 it is this uh homage to Where the
Wild Things Are the children's book and
it is um also a news stand that's pretty
cool Scooby-Doo team up number
one Batman 457 news stand first time we
get Tim Drake in the Robin
costume okay this one I love Batman 66
number
one new stories based on the um Adam
West TV series is great Mike all red
cover Detective Comics 737 this is the
third in continuity appearance of Harley
Quinn Batgirl number nine Stephanie
Brown era of Batgirl with this gorgeous
art germ cover
Marley's Christmas special number
one this is an interesting
book D Jango Zoro number one from
dynamite and
Virgo look at who wrote the
book written by Quenton Tarantino who of
course wrote the D Jango Unchained
movie speaking of movie
adaptations uh idw's Edward Scissor
Hands number one
now again it didn't have all of the
issues but we had issues three and four
of Deadpool Pool Kills of Marvel
Universe both second
prints and then by far the best book in
the
batch and I do think it is a candidate
I'm going to press it I'm going to move
it up to the top of my pressing pile um
because of speculation ISS there are
some non-color breaking spine ticks that
I need to get out but I think the color
works pretty well
to see down there on the lower right but
it's Deadpool MK with the mouth number
seven the First Lady
Deadpool some there had been some
speculation because Taylor Swift had
appeared in a Deadpool costume that she
was going to play Lady
Deadpool who knows it's still a pretty
cool key um and it was by far the best
book in the batch so let me know what
you think about this um collection not a
great collection but
you know I'll I'll be able to pull
enough out of it to be okay and um have
some good books I also did grab just a
few books to
keep I have a whole bunch of sets um and
this first wave special I'm not sure if
I got this or not uh there was a
miniseries with Batman Doc Savage and
Justice Inc I actually just read the
first issue of that um this for some
reason I was missing Legend of Dark
Knight 161 I think I need one more issue
I probably have it somewhere stuck to
the back of something else and then
uncanny Avengers 1 through
4 from 2015 just to the point where I I
don't think I picked that up so that's
going to be um those are going in the PC
and um yeah I got I got a bunch of other
sets and and more minor keys so again
nothing great there nothing that's going
to that'll send the kids through college
but um a decent little collection so let
me know what you think in the meantime
you can take a look at a couple of my
other videos here and this is Jim saying
enjoy your
comics
