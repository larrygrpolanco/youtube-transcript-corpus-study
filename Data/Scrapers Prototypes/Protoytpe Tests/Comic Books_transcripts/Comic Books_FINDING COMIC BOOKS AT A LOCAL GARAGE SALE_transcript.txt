hello everyone welcome back I actually
found a garage sale comic book
collection
now I can't take all the credit I had
some help and we're going to call them
just Mr h
what you're seeing is what Mr H has sent
me through Facebook Messenger
basically this guy was promoting his own
garage sale
with the books he was selling
if you guys have ever gone out hunting
and digging it's super hard at least for
me in my area to find
comic books in garage sales it's even
hard to find old video games old toys
anything like that is usually picked
over
well we found one
and uh there was some pretty decent
stuff in here I get to get the message
late Friday night and Saturday morning
at the crack of dawn I was up and I was
driving
some of these guys in some of these
areas that make videos I mean it's like
they just walk out their back door and
find stuff I I don't have that in West
Virginia I gotta go hunting
and this is what I come across so when I
come up to this guy's house I'm there so
early that there's literally nobody else
there and the guy hadn't even set up
so to say that I was eager was an
understatement which is never what you
want to be in the first place
but when I get there there's an older
gentleman there he's got a big beard big
hair and I'm like uh are you the
gentleman that has the the comic books
he says no that's my son well the sun
was coming down he was having to set
some stuff up
he hadn't even set up the books yet I
was there that early
guy comes out he says uh I know you
and I'm my heart kind of sinks because
this could go one of two ways you know
it could go the way of the man bun or it
could go the way of all the people that
have loved and supported me over these
three years I've been doing this luckily
enough this guy was actually friends
with me on Facebook I don't even know
how we were friends on Facebook and he
is a a viewer and he was actually in our
uh claim sale at Alex the combo the
quarters claim sale uh just last week
so I was I was excited I was like oh man
this guy you know he he's he likes
YouTube and obviously loves comic books
so I was I was excited
so uh when I get there you know he had
everything priced already
um and I was kind of talking to him
about you know what exactly this was and
and this is basically stuff that he was
just trying to get rid of
um he apparently has a Personal
Collection
um and I kind of asked him you know hey
could I I take a look at that or you
know would you let me uh see see your
collection and he kind of hummed and
hauled a little bit
and it was pretty obvious that he was a
viewer of sticky Goose comics and he
kind of he he knew my schtick and you
know I knew I I go to people's houses
all the time I go to people's shops and
I you know I I show their collections
off and um yeah he was not he was not
feeling that I even offered to pay him
to look at his collection and he said
um no which I respect that you know
that's cool I I
to me if if somebody was coming to my
house and once showing up at the crack
of dawn wanting to buy comic books dude
I'd be letting him show I'd be showing
them what I got because there's a chance
that they would be buying something else
so as I'm digging I'm pulling out stuff
I'm seeing Dark Horse Star Wars I'm
seeing Silver age stuff like this Nick
Fury book
um several of his better Silver age
books and as you can see by that sticky
note on the back they were missing a
page missing an advertisement
um centerfold was detached you know
there were there was something wrong
with these Silver age books and that was
why he was selling them obviously
um you know we we kind of talked YouTube
um and I don't know if you guys have
ever you know chatted with somebody
while digging it's kind of tricky
because you know as you're looking you
know your your mind is thinking is this
what is this is this a key at least I
have to do that my my brain just doesn't
automatically register X Y and Z so
you know I was kind of chatting with him
it was nice to talk to him especially
another guy who you know is kind of got
his fingers on the pulse of uh the comic
book community and specifically the
YouTube comic book community so that was
kind of cool
um but it is kind of tricky to to dig
while doing that these two boxes you see
here to the right uh these were you know
very very much like dollar books
um some of them didn't even have uh
boards there's a nice Alex Ross JLA
cover there was that Hickman Avengers
run and I kind of kicking myself because
I probably should have gotten that
um that Hickman Avengers number one and
there may be some other keys in that
that I'm not aware of I just recently
bought those two Omnibus and I've heard
that that's one of the best
if not the best Avengers story ever and
one of the best graphic novels or one of
the best runs of all time
classic 90s fodder here we've got some
Superman stuff some Thor stuff uh X
Factor you know this is the type of
stuff you would I would expect to see in
a garage sale just a random uh garage
sale
so
um
it was it I was I was feeling pretty
good at this point I had already pulled
uh several books out and
um I was definitely already the gears
were turning you know Let's Make a Deal
I when I go one of my things is when I
go and I'm traveling somewhere even if
I'm going to a convention it's just very
hard for me to like not to to leave
empty-handed to not pick up anything
um that's maybe a fault of mine
um I think the books that I did get are
decent uh I don't I think I probably
paid exactly what they are worth I I
don't think that I I got any steals
that's for sure
here's a nice little Young Avengers dark
rain I mean that Young Avengers run
don't sleep on that that was good
so the first first book I pull out here
and I ask him the first thing I said is
can I film he said yes
uh well actually he kind of hummed and
hauled before I before he said yes but
he did say yes and then I asked could I
open this out of open this uh book out
of the bag he said absolutely so to all
you haters out there I do ask
when I'm paging through here I'm just
trying to keep a page count I'm looking
at page quality I'm checking the center
fold
and you can see the back of this book
it's beat up
um nice little nice little key here this
is the first uh solo series of Wonder
Man
uh this is not Wonder Man's first
appearance that is in uh either Avengers
or Fantastic Four I think it's an
Avengers
um
this is still a pretty good key uh
especially considering that
they are apparently making a Disney plus
Wonder Man Show which blows my freaking
mind
this book I was very surprised to see
him at that price point you could see
the fifteen dollars
he had 25 on the JLA 29 book and then he
had uh like I said 15 on this book
and then I think he had that had ten
dollars on Wonder Man uh this uh this
first Lando second Boba Fett was very
nice
so we we pulled some stuff
um we're back here uh let's take a
closer look at some of the things we
pulled
this is a nice little book this is a
Secret Avengers
um this is uh the first appearance of
the new sorry Secret Avengers number 19.
this is kind of like the first
appearance of the new Moon Knight
costume so this is the the alter ego we
see in uh the Disney Plus show and then
it later becomes you know the the cover
of that Jeff Lemire
um run that we see in 2014.
this is ASM 545 this is the conclusion
of the one more day run this is when uh
Mephisto erases the the marriage of
Peter and Mary Jane
I just love this cover
I I really like Mephisto as a character
I think uh that Silver Surfer run with
the first appearance of Mephisto that is
the best part of that run
um I really would like to see Mephisto
on the big screen and more stories with
Mephisto but he's he you know he's
straight up the devil we're probably not
going to see that
this is the first appearance of Lily
Hollister later becomes Menace and first
appearance of Carly Cooper
like I said this is the Marvel Premiere
uh featuring uh Wonder Man number 55
this is the direct copy
it's got some spine ticks uh you know
this is not a high grade copy this is a
very fine copy you know 6.0 very fine
minus maybe fine
I guess I'm being positive about it
yeah it's the first solo wonder man
that's all it is and that's why I picked
it up
this next book you know this is this is
a pretty good book I mean I don't really
collect a lot of Star Wars but my
favorite characters are Darth Maul and
one of my favorite other characters is
Lando you know the intergalactic space
pimp you know he's drinking a Colt 45
while he's you know he's running vespin
and you know it's it's a high it was a
higher grade book I was shocked to see
you know what he had it priced at I mean
it's not
it's not higher than an eight I mean
it's got all four blunted corners the
back of this book I can clean that and
espec and that also that Mephisto with
the color rub up and down the spine I
have a pretty good
my way of cleaning the book I can get
that off pretty easily without doing too
much damage and not
you know going too crazy with the
cleaning stuff
it's also the second appearance of Boba
Fett which is pretty decent but this
this was the this was the cream of the
crop I mean if you guys don't know this
is Justice League of America number 29.
this is the first appearance of the
crime syndicate Ultraman Owlman power
power ring Superwoman Johnny quick the
second it's also the first Silver age
star man another key in the crisis on
infinite Earth stuff
um this is a awesome cover you've got
the JSA looking down
um on the uh the JLA that crime
syndicate
this is this is a classic book a classic
cover I'm super glad to have this in the
collection all right let's get down to
it what did I pay for this lot of comics
he had these Comics priced at 56 or 59 I
offered 40 40 cash was accepted 40 bucks
for these books I mean to be honest that
JLA 29 is maybe a 40 book
um
after that book could be cleaned and
pressed so
40 bucks and I I mean I think they're
worth that guys I hope you guys enjoyed
