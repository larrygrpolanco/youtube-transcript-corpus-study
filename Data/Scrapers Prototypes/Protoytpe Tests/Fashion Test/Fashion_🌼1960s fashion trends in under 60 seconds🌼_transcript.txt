1960s fashion in under 60 seconds rain
bullets were kept on your purse and held
this which protected your hair from the
rain Dickies for that turtleneck look
without the bulk continuous have mini
skirts sometimes bought in the
children's section disposable dresses
made of paper space age fashion led by
Andre Coolidge upcycle pieces like this
skirt made from scarves Circle tights
and go-go boots finally pillbox hats and
Lily Pulitzer a lot Jackie Kennedy what
did I miss
