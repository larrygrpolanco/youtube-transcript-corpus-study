how World War II changed fashion forever
first skirts got shorter wartime rations
on fabric ended the 30s ankle length
styles and it was considered patriotic
to wear shorter Styles two we got
creative with makeup stockings became
scarce since nylon was needed for
parachutes so women used foundation and
eyeliner to create the look of stockings
three we got creative with materials
leather was needed for the war so shoes
are often made of velvet mesh reptile
skin or sometimes even wood finally
women wore pants women workers needed
something that wouldn't snag on
machinery and just wore men's pants
until manufacturers cut on and made
women's pants widely available
