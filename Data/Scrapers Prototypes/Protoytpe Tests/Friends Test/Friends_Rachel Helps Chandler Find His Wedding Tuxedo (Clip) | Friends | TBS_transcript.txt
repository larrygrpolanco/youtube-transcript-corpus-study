So, now, these are all
the tuxedos that we make
and if there's
anything that you like
we can make
you a deal.
Anything at all.
But these are the three
that Monica pre-approved.
Ah, well, thanks a lot
for hooking me up, Rach.
I want you to know
that I want you
to attend our
wedding as my guest.
I'm Monica's
maid of honor...okay?
Don't try to blue-pin me.
Well, what's
the deal with these?
- These-these look nice.
- Well, they are nice.
We-we custom make
tuxedos for celebrities
and then when they're done with
them, they just send them back.
You mean, like,
for award shows?
Some of 'em.
You mean these
tuxes have been down
the red carpet
with people yelling, uh
"Who are you wearing?
You look fabulous!"
Honey, might I
suggest watching
a little more ESPN
and a little less E!
Okay, who wore those?
Um...well, let's see.
Uh, this one's Tom Brokaw.
Not bad.
This one is, uh,
Paul O'Neill.
Who's that?
He plays for the Yankees.
Seriously, ESPN.
Just once in a while.
Have it on in the background.
Ooh, this one
was Pierce Brosnan.
- Pierce Brosnan?
- Uh-huh.
- Are you serious?
- Yes.
007.
- This is James Bond's tux?
- Yeah.
Oh, I have to get married
in James Bond's tux.
- It's a pretty cool tux.
- Ah, it's not just that.
I would be England's
most powerful weapon.
A jet-setting
heartbreaker
"On Her Majesty's
Secret Service."
A man who fears no one,
with a license to kill.
Would Monica
let me wear this?
We should really learn
how to play the real way.
I like our way. Oh..
Oh, ah, hey.
Chess.
- Nice move.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So, Joey, I just hooked
Ross and Chandler up
with some tuxedos for
the wedding. Do you need one?
No, I'm performing the ceremony.
I'm not wearing a tux.
Well, what are you gonna wear?
Multi-colored robes.
- Ooh, and maybe a hat.
- Huh.
- Does Monica know about this?
- I don't think so.
Can I please be there
when you tell her?
Hey, oh, Rach, wait, do you
wanna go to a movie tonight?
Oh, you know what?
I can't.
I have to have dinner
with that Melissa girl.
Can I come?
I won't even talk,
you'll just hear the noise
from my video camera.
What is this?
What's going on?
Oh, good. Can I tell her?
Can I tell her?
Well, do you wanna hear
what actually happened
or Joey's lewd version?
Joey's.
Hey, come on.
I have this friend from college
and I made the stupid
mistake of telling Joey
that one time..
...she and I, you know..
...kissed a little bit.
[chuckling]
Yeah, I'm sure that happened.
- It-it did.
- Sure.
Hey, it happened.
Yeah, it was
senior year in college.
It was after the Sigma Chi luau
and Melissa and I got very drunk
and we ended up kissing..
...for several minutes.
Which means she had
a couple spritzers
and a quick peck on the cheek.
Why are you taking
this away from me?
Yeah, why is it so hard
for you to believe?
Okay, I just, I didn't know
that you were a lesbian.
I'm not saying
that I am a lesbian.
I'm just saying
that this happened.
Okay. It just
seems pretty wild.
And you're,
you know, so..
...vanilla.
Vanilla? I'm not vanilla.
I've done lots of crazy things.
I mean, I-I got, I got
drunk and married in Vegas.
To Ross.
Alright, you know what,
if you don't wanna
believe me about this,
why don't you just
come with me to dinner tonight
and she will tell you.
Okay, alright, yeah.
'Cause I just can't picture it.
Oh-ho, you should
get inside my head.
