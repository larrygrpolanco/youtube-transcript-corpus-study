So are we expecting the rest of our party
shortly?
Yes, they are expected presently.
Yeah. Their. Their arrival is in the offing.
Right. Well, we do have a table for two
available. Perhaps you'd be more
comfortable.
No, they're coming. We're waiting right here.
Joseph. One needn't worry.
They shan't be long.
It's just that we do have some large parties
waiting.
Oh, one really does have a stick up one's
arse, doesn't one?
How can you smoke in this day and age?
Have you not seen that ad with the little
kid walks through Grandpa?
It's chilling.
I messed up. It was a meeting.
Everybody was smoking.
So what? Don't you have any willpower?
Willpower? I've watched home movies of you
eating Ding Dongs without taking the tinfoil
off.
You said that was sexy.
Okay, look, can we just drop this?
I'm not going to smoke again.
That's right. Because I forbid you to smoke
again.
You forbid me?
You know, I've flown a long way to see my
loving wife.
Is she here, by the way?
Cut a jog with me. Okay?
I'm very, very upset right now.
Oh, would you say this is the most upset you
could be?
I think so.
Well, then I might as well do this.
Not really sure what to do now.
Well, I'll tell you what we're going to do.
We're already late for Phoebe's birthday
dinner. So you're going to put out that
cigarette? We're going to put this fight on
hold and go have sex.
Fine. What?
Since this is the last day that I'm
ovulating. And if we if we don't do it now,
then I'm going to have to wait till next
month.
You're serious?
Oh, yeah. All right, fine.
I'll do it. But no talking.
And no cuddling and.
No kissing your neck.
Oh, good. I hate it when you do that.
And lots of kissing your neck.
Okay, well, the super is not home.
But you know what? My mother's going to be
here in a minute, and she has the key.
I can't. I can't wait that long. You have to
do something. Knock that door down.
I would, but I bruise like a peach.
Besides, you know, everything's going to be
fine. The baby's sleeping.
What if she jumped out of the bassinet?
Can't hold her own head up, but, yeah.
Jumped.
Oh, my God. I left the water running.
But you did not leave the water running.
Please, just. Just pull yourself together.
Okay.
But did I leave the stove on?
You haven't cooked since 1996.
There's a window open. Because if the window
is open, a bird could fly in there and.
Oh, my God. You know what? I think you're
right. I think you know.
Listen, listen.
A pigeon.
No. No way.
No, no. An eagle flew in, landed on the
stove and caught fire.
The baby seeing this, jumps across the
apartment to the mighty Bird's aid.
The eagle, however, misconstrues this as an
act of aggression and grabs the baby in its
talent. Meanwhile, the faucet fills the
apartment with water.
Baby and bird still ablaze are locked in a
death grip, swirling around the whirlpool
that fills the apartment.
Boy. Are you going to be sorry if that's
true?
Hello. Hi.
It's been an hour.
The maitre d has asked if you'd be willing
to reconsider switching to a smaller table.
Maybe we should just eat now.
You can't order until the entire party has
arrived. Restaurant policy.
Well, how about this? Another table leaves,
right? But there's still some food left on
their plates. Okay.
What's the restaurant's policy about people
eating that? It's frowned upon, but it
happens. All right.
I got to go to the bathroom.
No, you can't go.
No, no, no, I can't. I can't hold this table
on my own. If they ask me to move, I'll
cave.
If you ask me to stay, I'll pee.
Good evening, miss.
Ms.. Ms..
Ms..
Okay, I'm fine. I'll move.
All right. You don't have to manhandle me.
Swear. Okay.
Thank you. Wow.
Finally. You guys made.
