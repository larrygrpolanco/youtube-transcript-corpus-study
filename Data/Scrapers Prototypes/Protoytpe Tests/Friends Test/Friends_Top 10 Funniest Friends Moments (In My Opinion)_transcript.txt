roots you can't play bagpipes at the
wedding
how did you know about that we heard you
play all the way from your apartment

what is important is while we appreciate
the gesture
we just don't feel that bagpipes are
appropriate for our wedding why not
because we hate them

for you and then decide whatever you
want and i'm not gonna tell you what

time i stabbed the cop
phoebe what he stabbed me first
phoebe yeah phoebe
your note
amazing
not only did no one touch my sandwich
but people at work are actually afraid
of me
yeah a guy called me mental mental
geller yeah
i've always wanted a cool nickname like
that
yeah the best you got in high school was
a wet pants killer
and what's the water fountain okay
anyway
people are writing reports for me uh
pushing back deadlines to fit my
schedule i'm telling you you get tough
with people and you can get anything you
want
hey tribiani give me that coffee now
[Applause]
we've been getting reports of some
very angry behavior on your part what
threatening letters refusal to meet
deadlines
a apparently people now call you
mental
we want you to speak to a psychiatrist
oh no
you don't understand ah this is so silly
um
this is all just because of a sandwich
a sandwich yeah
you see my my sister makes these amazing
turkey sandwiches her secret is she puts
uh an extra slice of gravy soaked bread
in the middle i call it the moist maker
anyway i i put my sandwich in the fridge
over here and
oh you know what well i i'm sorry i
i i believe i ate that
you ate my sandwich
it was a simple mistake it could happen
to anyone oh really
did you confuse it with your own turkey
sandwich with a moist maker
no i do you perhaps remember
seeing
a note
on top of it there may have been a joke
or
limerick of some kind that said
it was my sandwich
now now calm down
come look in my office some of it may
still be in the trash
what
well it was quite large i i i i had to
throw most of it away you you you you
threw my sandwich away
my
sandwich my sandwich
uh it's really important to the director
that everything in this movie is
authentic
yeah and so in your love scene with
sarah she talks about how she's never
seen a naked man who wasn't jewish
so
so
what
so
uh
well the director is insisting that
whoever played that part be
authentically uh anatomically
not jewish
you get what i'm saying yes okay
no what
an italian catholic immigrant at this
time would not be
bar mitzvahed
[Music]
so to get this part you can't be no but
you are yep but you told him you weren't
that's right
wow wow
and it's definitely all gone there's
nothing there to work with
what were you thinking i don't know i
really want this part you know and they
tell you no matter what you get asked
during an audition you say yes
like if if they want you to ride a horse
you tell them you can and you just
figure out how to do it later
joey this is not like learning to ride a
horse this is like learning to
grow a turtleneck
i know i know i know okay
and apparently tomorrow when i go in to
meet the director i have to take off my
clothes so that they can see what my
body looks like god what are you gonna
do
i just have to call my agent and tell
her i can't do the part
unless
unless what well this may sound crazy
but
there may be something that we could
fashion
like what well i'm not sure yet but um
off the top of my head i'm thinking
double-sided tape and some sort of
luncheon meat
all right
turkey
that won't work
cheese that won't work
olive loaf
i hope that won't work
are you making him a sandwich
no it's um more like a wrap
so why don't you go into your room and
try these on and we'll see if we'll get
a better idea of what's gonna work
thanks you are such a good friend and
this is so weird
we just need to uh
leslie yeah
uh joey this is the awkward part oh hey
right not a problem i
totally understand you need to you know
make sure i don't have any horrible
scars or tattoos don't you worry
i have nothing to hide
so there you go

after one class i don't think so what
you want to see me self-defend myself go
over there and pretend you're a sexual
predator go on i dare you
of course you could defend yourself from
an attack you know is coming that's not
enough
look i studied karate for a long time
and there's a concept you should really
be familiar with it's what the japanese
call
unagi
isn't that a kind of sushi
no it's a concept yeah it is it is it's
freshwater eel
all right maybe it means that too oh i
would kill for a salmon skin roll right
now
you know fine get attacked i don't even
care
come on ross we're sorry please tell us
what it is
unagi is a state of total awareness
okay only by achieving true unagi can
you be prepared for any danger that may
befall you
you mean in case someone's trying to
steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your
kettle of fish
all i'm saying is it's one thing being
prepared for an attack against like each
other whole another story being prepared
for an attack i don't know like a
surprise
all right you knew that was coming but
that doesn't mean you have unagi
[Applause]
ooh you know what if we made
reservations we could have unagi in
about a half hour
what the hell was that
a lesson in the importance of unagi
oh
you're a freak
perhaps
now i'm curious at what point during
those girlish screams would you have
begun to kick my ass
all right so we weren't prepared
i'm sorry i had to take such drastic
measures to make my point but i look i
just want you guys to be safe oh
danger
uh

[Laughter]
[Applause]
[Music]
salmon skin roll

they're my friends in fact i i i was
married to one of them
