This is Joey Tribbiani.
Joey, these are the producers.
And as you probably already know, this is
Leonard Hayes. Wow.
It is so amazing to meet you.
I am such a big fan of your work.
Well, I've, uh, I've been blessed with, uh, a
lot, a lot of great roles.
Tell me about it, huh?
Unlimited nights and weekends.
Are you making fun of me?
Because I am not a sellout.
I didn't do that for the money.
I believe in those phones.
I almost lost a cousin because of bad
wireless service.
No, no, I wasn't making fun of you.
Honestly, I think you were great in those
commercials. Really?
Yeah, well, I do bring a certain credibility
to the role. Oh.
It's true. Are you kidding?
When they shoot you out of that cannon.
Hang up that phone.
One take. Wow.
Did that. So shall we, uh, read?
Oh, yeah. Sure.
Top of act two.
This is my entrance.
You got it. Mm.
The hell are you still doing here?
Oh, uh, I think you know.
Bastard.
I am what you made me.
You know what? I could go right now.
Go, go I can't.
Oh, I want to.
Long pause.
But I can't.
So sorry. You're not supposed to say.
Long pause.
Oh, I thought that was your character's name.
You know, I thought you were, like, an
Indian or something. You know what the.
Sorry.
No. Thank you so much for coming in.
We appreciate it. Thank you.
I appreciate you. So you don't want me to do
it again? I could do it with an accent, you
know, southern.
I could go right now, man.
My God in heaven.
Joey, hang on for a second.
Leonard, can we talk to you for a moment?
Yes. Listen, you.
You've got to be kidding.
See? He can't act.
Hey, I don't care if you think he's hot.
You know, if you want to sleep with him, do
it on your own time.
This is a play. No.
Listen, if you insist on this, I will call
my agent so fast on a cell phone that has a
connection that is so clear, he's going to
think I'm next door.
Uh, hi. Uh, thank you so much for whispering
for my benefit. But, um, look, if you just
tell me what I did wrong, I would love to
work on it and come back and try it again
for you. And then also, how you doing?
We should please just give me another
chance. I really want to get better.
Please. Really?
Well, if you want to come back at the end of
the day today, here are my notes.
Ready? Yeah. Um, you're in your head.
You're. You're thinking way too much.
I really doubt that.
No, no, it's it's that you're not connected
with anything in your body.
There's no urgency.
The scene is a struggle.
It's a it's a race.
Also, what you did was horizontal.
Don't be afraid to explore the vertical.
No. And don't learn the words.
Let the words learn you.
Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?
Hey, do you want to go to dinner tonight?
Oh, I can't, I've got a date with that
waitress, Katie.
Yeah, I know we've only gone out, like,
twice, but I don't know.
I have a really good feeling about her.
Oh, I hear divorce bells, huh?
All right, just give me your wallets and
there won't be a problem. What?
I have a gun.
Okay, just just relax, Phoebe, just stay
calm. Oh, my God, I can't find my wallet.
All right, lady. Now give me your purse.
No. What do you mean, no?
I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay.
Lowell, is that you?
Phoebe?
Oh my God! I'm sorry.
Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the
streets.
Lowell. Ross.
Ross, nice to meet you.
Yeah, a real pleasure.
Oh, it's been so long.
Oh. So long.
I can't.
Believe you're still doing.
This. Huh? I know.
But I quit smoking. Good for you.
So you look like you're doing really well.
I guess your mugging days are behind you.
Oh.
Oh my God, Phoebe.
You used to mug people.
Excuse me, Ross, I'm old friends catching up.
