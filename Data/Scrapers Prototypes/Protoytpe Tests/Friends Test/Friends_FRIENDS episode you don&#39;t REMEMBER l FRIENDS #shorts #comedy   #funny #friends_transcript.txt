I can't find anything that I want to eat
everything makes me nauseous I'm telling
you being pregnant is no piece of cake
oh cake
no what does that smell
it's coming from the bathroom oh
pregnancy does give you some weird
cravings
good
is it the shampoo it's guava no
oh wait wait is it my bologna sandwich
yes yes
believe the baby wants baloney baby
wants me to eat meat I can't eat meat oh
wait wait
maybe it's a pickle
