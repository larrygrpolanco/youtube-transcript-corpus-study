Excuse me. Um, is there a woman waiting at
the bar? Um, someone.
Average height, dark hair, or perhaps doing
a puzzle?
Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy.
Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a
drink on me.
Uh, can I get you another glass of wine?
I don't know if I should.
I don't want to be drunk when I go home
alone.
Got stood up, huh?
Yeah, it's no big deal.
It was just a blind date.
Are you worried your date came, saw you and
left? Whoa!
We're okay.
I'm still ovulating.
Oh, good. Because as of 4:00 this afternoon,
I am not.
So let's do this.
I don't think I can.
Oh, come on, I know you're not 18 anymore,
but give it a minute.
Because of Emma.
Oh my God. Emma!
Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here.
Oh, you're right. We can't do this.
We can't leave her alone.
Sorry. Unless maybe we do it here.
I mean, how much can she even be aware of at
this age?
Well, she's aware when we leave a room, she
may notice if we start canoodling in it.
Canoodling.
Well, I can't say hump or screw in front of
the baby.
How everything looks so good.
I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
I just have to say this.
You're really beautiful.
Oh, well, that's that's very sweet.
Thank you.
I'm kind of funny looking.
So what do you think you want to order?
I'm real excited about that chicken.
I'm not funny either.
So if you were thinking, well, he's not that
good looking, maybe we'll have some laughs.
That ain't gonna happen.
Well, come on, Steve, let's not rule out
nervous laughter.
Hey, now, wait a minute.
Phoebe told me that, uh, that you owned your
own restaurant.
That's impressive.
I lost it to drugs.
Hey, Silkscreened t shirts now.
Really? What's that like?
It's really fulfilling doing something you
hate for no money.
That's right. I have no money.
I'm not funny.
I live in a studio apartment with two other
guys. And I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.
Now come on, come on.
Steve. There must be something that you like
about yourself, huh?
I do like my hair.
Really?
And for you to.
