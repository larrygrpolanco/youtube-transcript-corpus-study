by all means all right
Okay who wants light cheese and who
wants dark cheese
I don't even want to know about the dark
cheese
but this one
you guys have to
Dominion on Thanksgiving
oh you got the bigger app what'd you
wish for
the bigger half
all right I'd like to propose a toast a
little toaster
I know this isn't exactly the kind of
Thanksgiving that all of you planned but
for me this has been really great you
know I think because
it didn't involve divorce or projectile
vomiting
anyway I was just thinking I mean if
you'd gone to Vail or a few guys have
been with your family or if you didn't
have
syphilis and stuff
we wouldn't be all together you know so
I guess what I'm trying to say is that
I'm very thankful that all of your
Thanksgiving sucked
and hey here's to a lousy Christmas and
a crappy New Year
nice nice
what exactly does this job entail that
the ad wasn't too clear
Michael it
I'm sorry Immaculate it's a completely
synthetic chocolate substitute
try a piece yeah we think that Michael
it is even better than chocolate all
right
yeah
I love how it crumbles
because chocolate doesn't do that oh man
well anywho we should be getting our FDA
approval any day now
[Laughter]
major food preparation holidays Easter

secret this year no we were playing this
game I learned at work you have to name
all the states in six minutes what
that's like insanely easy no it's a lot
harder than it sounds you always forget
at least one or in some cases
14.
it's a stupid game and it wasn't playing
against other people so technically I
didn't lose but you forgot 14 States
nobody cares about the Dakotas
oh okay time's up all right I got 48. oh
that's not bad babes oh I got tired of
naming States so I decided to list the
types of celery
and I have one regular celery
okay so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has
the lead in
vegetables Joy say hello to the new
champ of Chandler's dumb States game wow
how many you got 56.

eat that no problem at least give me a
challenge

the chicken and the turkey and
everything on the other side of the
table the smell is just yeah
