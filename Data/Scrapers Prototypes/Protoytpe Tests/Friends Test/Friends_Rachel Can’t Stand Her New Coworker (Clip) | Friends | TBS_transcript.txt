Whaz up?
Seriously, dude.
Three years ago.
Listen, can you do me a favor?
I'm going to be out today.
Can you just keep an eye on Joey?
Make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
You don't trust him?
No.
Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter.
The hot nanny.
Is this really your long-term plan for me to run interference? 
Because I could get a job
any day now.
You do appear right on the cusp of something.
Look. Come on, man, I'm sure he'll lose interest
in a week or two. But for now, could you
please just do this for me?
All right. Fine. But don't blame me if it doesn't work,
because you know as well as I do. Once Joey sets his mind on something,
more often than not, he's going to have sex with it. 
Where are you going, Joe?
For a walk.
Oh. You mind if I join you?
Actually, I'd rather be alone.
You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.
Your thoughts?
Plural?
All right. Fine, I only have one thought.
It's about the hot nanny. I got to see her!
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
Now you're telling me I can't see her?
You guys are killing me.
She's forbidden fruit.
It's like. Like. 
Like she's the princess and I'm the stableboy.
Why are you doing this? Huh?
Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?
Yes, as a matter of fact, he did.
So I can't let you go.
Huh?
Interesting.
Now there are obstacles.
Hot nanny and me against the world.
It's the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
Great novels?
Fine. Mediocre porn.
[phone ringing]
Gavin Mitchell's office.
Rachel Green's office.
Give me that phone.
Hello, this is Rachel Green.
How can I help you?
Uh huh.
Okay, then.
I'll pass you back to your son.
Hey, mom.
No, that's just my secretary.
Um, excuse me Gavin,
I have a question I need to ask you.
Um, I'll call you later. Yeah.
Yes.
If you like looking at butts so much, 
why don't you just go look in a mirror?
Thank God you finally said that.
I saw you make a note on your pad
three hours ago.
[crumpling paper]
Man. I really bug you, don't I?
Oh, no.
Please, I don't care about you enough to bug me.
In fact,
from now on, I'm going to take the high road.
And I'm going to be very, very nice to you,
you mama's boy. Starting right now.
Hey, Rach. 
Hi.
Hey. Are you ready for your birthday lunch?
I am, I am.
Oh, but first, Monica,
I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleague
and more importantly, my wonderful friend, Gavin Mitchell.
Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.
So, are you coming to Rachel's party tonight?
Oh, no no. No no no,
Gavin, I can't
he already has plans.
Most likely with his mother.
Well, I don't mind. I'll cancel them.
I would never miss my secretary's birthday.
God. Why didn't you invite him?
I can't stand that guy.
You were just being so nice to him.
I was faking it. 
Can't you tell when I'm being fake? 
Oh, hey, Mr. Phillips, 
nice suit. 
Right there.
That was so fake.
Shhh.
