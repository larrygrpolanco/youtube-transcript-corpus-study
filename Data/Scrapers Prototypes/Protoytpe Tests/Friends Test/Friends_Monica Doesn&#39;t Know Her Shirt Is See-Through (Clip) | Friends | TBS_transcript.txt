Hi, I'm Monica

Hey.
[door closes]
I need your help.
Wow, it seems serious.
What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?
Ok, look. I'm getting new headshots taken, all right?
So I went to get my eyebrows shaped. 
I'm sorry.
Moment to make fun of that, please.
It made me a sissy, but I'll still pound you into the ground.
All right. Look, it hurts so bad
I could only let her do one eyebrow, and now
they don't match!
Huh?
It's like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama.
But what the hell am I supposed to do?
All right, I will help you out,
but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone
what I'm about to tell you.
What? What?
Okay,
you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage?
Well, I earned mine by
plucking the eyebrows of my father and
his
"business partners."
Oh but Chandler, I don't know if I can take any more plucking.
It hurts so bad.
Oh.
Not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe vera, and my gentle
self-loathing touch.

Whoo!
[audience] Awww.
I'm sorry, the song is over.
Did you see me up there?
Every little bit of you.
Did you hear that one guy shouting?
Look at those tips!
Did I really help you get a lot of tips?
Sure.
If you so much for letting me do this.
Public bathrooms freak me out.
I can't even pee, let alone do anything else.
But what's great is you don't mind talking about it.
Good choice Ross.
Oh, hey.
Hi. There you are. I've been looking for you everywhere.
Oh, yeah. Hello. Well, here, here I am.
Hey, listen, my mom is not bringing the baby back until 9:00,
so I was hoping you and I could have a chance to kind of talk.
[toilet flushing]
Somebody here?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's Michelle.
Who?
Oh, just this woman I've been seeing.
You've been seeing someone?
Yeah. Did I mention that?
Uh, yeah. Um, I mean, we haven't been going out too long,
but, uh, there's this amazing connection between us.
What are you taking amoxicillin for?
How great is this? You're already comfortable
enough to to look through my stuff.
I'm sorry. Michelle, this is my roommate, Rachel.
Hi. And I'm also Emma's mother.
Oh.
Who's Emma?
Oh, I told you about my daughter.
This is your daughter?
See, I could be your new mommy.
