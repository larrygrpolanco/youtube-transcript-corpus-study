should get out of there otherwise you're
just an idiot in the box

idea i'm sorry i well you should be
screw it bring on the yams
well but you've worked so hard yeah okay
uh will i i just want to say that i'm
real sorry for whatever i i did to you
in high school oh it wasn't just me
we had a club
you had a club that's right the i hate
rachel green club
oh my god so would you all just join
together to hate me who else was in this
club me
and ross
no need to point she knows who ross is
you were in an i hate rachel club yes he
was
no no
so who else was in this club uh actually
there was also that exchange student
from thailand but i i don't think he he
knew what it was
so ross we went out for two years and
you never told me you were in and i hate
rachel club you went out with her
we had a pact
that was in high school it's not like it
was binding forever then why did it have
the word eternity in it
okay monica did you know about this i
swear i didn't hey is that why you guys
used to go up to your bedroom and lock
the door yeah
hmm a little relieved i got to say
oh we did a little more than that no no
no no no no
why why what else did you do we started
a rumor
not
rumor
oh come on will just take off your shirt
and tell us
[Applause]
ross
it's no big deal
we
i said that the the rumor was that um
you had both
male and female reproductive parts
what that's right we said your parents
flipped a coin decided to raise her as a
girl but you still had a hint of a penis
oh my god you started that what you
heard that
everyone at our school heard it
everybody at my school heard it you were
the hermaphrodite cheerleader from long
island oh no
oh my god this is all making so much
sense to me now this is why adam carter
wouldn't go out with me this is why
billy tratt would just stay in this
region actually billy tratt is gay now
so so that one's not really our fault
monica how come you never told me this i
thought it might be true and i was
afraid that you were gonna cry and then
show it to me
joey stop staring there's nothing there
it's not true
i'm afraid i'm gonna need proof oh
everyday use fancy guest fancy guest two
