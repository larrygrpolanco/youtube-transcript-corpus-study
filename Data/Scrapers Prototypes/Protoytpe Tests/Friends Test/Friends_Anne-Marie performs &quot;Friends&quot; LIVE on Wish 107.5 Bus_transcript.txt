Wish 107.5
You say you love me, I say you crazy
We're nothing more than friends
You're not my lover, more like a brother
I known you since we were like ten, yeah
Don't mess it up
Talking that it
It's only gonna push me away
That's it
When you say you love me
That made me crazy
Here we go again
Don't go look at me with that look in your eye
You really ain't going away without a fight
You can't be reason with I'm done being polite
I told you 1 2 3 4 5 6 thousand times
Haven't I made it obvious
Haven't I made it clear
Want me to spell it out for you?
F-R-I-EN-D-S
Haven't I made it obvious
Haven't I made it clear
Want me to spell it out for you?
F-R-I-EN-D-S
Have you got no shame?
You looking insane
Turning up at my door
It's two in the morning, the rain is pouring
Haven't we been here before?
Don't mess it up, talking that it
Only gonna push me away, that's it!
Have you got no shame? You looking insane
So don't go look at me with that look in your eye
You really ain't going away without a fight
You can't be reasoned with, I'm done being polite
I've told you 1 2 3 4 5 6 thousand times
Haven't I made it obvious?
Haven't I made it clear?
Want me to spell it out for you?
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
Haven't I made it obvious?
Haven't I made it clear?
Want me to spell it out for you?
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
That's how you f****** spell "friends"
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
Get that sh*t inside your head
No, no, yeah, uh, ahh
F-R-I-E-N-D-S HAHA
We're just friends
So don't go look at me with that look in your eye
You really ain't going nowhere without a fight
You can't be reasoned with, I'm done being polite
I've told you one, two, three, four, five, six thousand times
Haven't I made it obvious?
Haven't I made it clear?
Want me to spell it out for you?
F-R-I-E-N-D-S

Haven't I made it clear?
Want me to spell it out for you?
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
