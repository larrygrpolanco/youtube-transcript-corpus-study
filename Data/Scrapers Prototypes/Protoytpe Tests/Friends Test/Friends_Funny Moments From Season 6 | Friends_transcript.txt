most people get married in Vegas are
drunk
and I'm drunk right now
I can't have a mimosa with breakfast I'm
on vacation
you guys gonna do oh I guess we just
find a divorce lawyer oh well I think I
think
Ross already has one
now this one's free right because you
paid for the first two so you get the
third one for free
laugh it up but the joke's on you
because we don't need to get divorced
okay we're just gonna get an annulment
an annulment Ross I don't think surgery
is the answer here
oh oh that's your thing
what
you know that you're the guy who gets
divorced
that's not my thing
I do not love getting divorced
her third divorce God you love divorce
so much I'm probably gonna marry it and
then
then it won't work out so you're gonna
have to divorce it divorcing guy
I'm so drunk
keep going we are phasing the accent out
phasing it out
so without retesting their results in
the laboratory
the team would never have identified
the initial errors in their carbon
dating a nail as well
were there any questions at this point
yes what's happening to your accent
come again what's what's this nonsense
all right I'm I'm not English
I'm from Long Island
I was really nervous and the accent just
just came out
I'm sorry
so if we could just get back to the
lecture

and since I made you wait I'll toss in a
free muffin
I know let's rest and drink lots of
fluids
but you know if I'm going to bed
you're coming
that would be impossible to resist if
you weren't all
drippy here
are you saying that you don't want to
get with this
[Laughter]
yeah I don't think you should say that
even when you're healthy
take this personally okay it's just that
I just can't have sex with a sick person
with you Chandler have
I mean I'm not sick let me prove it to
you
we are two healthy people but the bribe
of life
see that's the thing I would like to
stay in the proud of my life this is my
favorite part yeah me too
you know what's sadder than this Bambi
I cried for three days with that movie
no wait two because on the third day my
mother killed herself so I was partly
crying for that
see now that I can see crying over but
Bambi is a cartoon you can cry when
Bambi's mother died yes it was very sad
when the guy stopped drawing the deer
foreign
