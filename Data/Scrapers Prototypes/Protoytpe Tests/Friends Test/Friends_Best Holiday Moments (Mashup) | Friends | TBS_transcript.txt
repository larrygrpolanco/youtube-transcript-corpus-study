Hi. Hey. Hi,
sorry I'm late.
Too many jokes.
Must mock Joey.
Nice shoes. Huh? [bells jingling]
Ah, you're killing me.
So, uh, is this, uh, mistletoe?
No, no, uh, that that is basil.
Ah, yeah, because it was mistletoe.
I was going to kiss you.
Ha oh.
Yeah. No, it's still basil.
Hey, guys, it's after midnight.
Merry Christmas, everyone.
Merry Christmas.
Oh my God.
Merry Christmas!
You saved them. You guys. Oh, God, you're the best.
Pheebs, you, uh. You got a second?
Sure. 
Yeah.
Ever since you, uh, told me that story about
that bike, I couldn't stop thinking about it.
I mean, everyone should have a first bike, you know?
So.
[gasp]
Oh my God, Ross.
Do you like it? 
I love it!
Yeah.
Oh. Oh, and I love you.
Oh, not that way.
The bike got you a lot closer.
Well, uh, take it downstairs.
You know, give it a test drive.
Okay. Oh, my God, my first bike.
Thank you for the best present I've ever gotten.
You're welcome.
Oh, and Chandler's about to cry.
I'm not.
All right, you know what?
Forget it. All of you. Forget it.
You've ruined it. Go home.
You've ruined it! You've ruined it!
That's right ruined! You got ruined everything!
You ruined it!
Thank you.
You're welcome.
What? Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben.
Maybe the lady will help me with these presents.
Wow, thanks!
You're welcome, Ben.
Merry Christmas.
Oh,
and
Happy Hanukkah!
Are you for Hanukkah, too?
Because I'm part Jewish.
You are?
Me, too.
Because armadillos also wandered in the desert?
You want to wander in the hall?
Hey, Ben.
What if the
Holiday Armadillo told you all about the
Festival of Lights?
Cool.
Yeah.
Come on, Ben.
Years and years ago, there were these people
called the Maccabees.
Ho, ho, ho
Merry Christmas.
Santa.
The miracle was that that little bit of oil
that should have lasted just one day,
burned for
eight whole days.
That's right. And that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today.
The end.
Awesome. 
Yeah.
My favorite part was when Superman flew
all the Jews out of Egypt.
The armadillo was actually not so thrilled
about that part.
Okay, Ben.
It's time to light the Hanukkah candles.
Oh. Ho, ho.
Hey.
Oh, wow.
Looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
Come on, come on.
We're lighting the candles.
Come on. 
Oh!
I understand why Superman is here,
but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
