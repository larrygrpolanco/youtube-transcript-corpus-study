hi uh you you don't know me i'm monica
geller or ross's sister oh yeah oh you
know it's too bad that didn't work out
yeah anyway he told me about your
apartment
and um well i i couldn't sleep thinking
about
it so uh
would it be okay if i cleaned it
no
hey guys
hey hey babies
oh i'm having the best morning that uh
that porsche i've got the keys to still
there shocking since you still have the
keys
you should see the treatment i get when
i'm with that car people are friendly
they they want to talk and not just
about the car one guy gave me advice
about my equity investments what equity
investments the ones that got me the
porsche will you keep up
i figured if if people keep seeing me
just standing there they're gonna start
to think i don't own it so i figure i'll
wash it right monica you got a bucket
and some soap i could borrow oh yeah i
got i got soap and sponges and rags and
carnauba wax and
polishing compound
you don't even have a car
i know but uh one time there was this
really dirty car parked in front of the
building so i watched it
and
and six others there you are
are you through that
yeah sorry the swallowing slowed me down
whose little ball of paper is this
oh that would be mine see uh i wrote a
note to myself and then i realized i
didn't need the notes so i balled it up
and now i wish i was dead
she already fluffed that pillow monica
you know you already flipped but it's
fine
look i'm sorry guys i just don't want to
give them any more ammunition than they
already have yes and we all know how
cruel a parent can be about the flatness
of a child's pillow
just i think there's never going to be a
right time to have a baby
i mean now you're unemployed and in a
little while you'll find a new job
that'll keep you really busy
and there's always gonna be a reason not
to do this but
i think once the baby comes
forget about all those reasons
i guess
it's always gonna be scary when we have
a baby it's gonna be really scary
my god
when we have a baby there's there's
gonna be so much that that we're not
able to control
i mean
the apartment's gonna be a mess
i won't have time to clean it
what if the baby gets into the ribbon
drawer
it messes up all the ribbons
what if there's no room for a ribbon
drawer because the baby's stuff takes up
all the space
where will all the ribbons go
should we go make a baby right now
before you change your mind yes please
