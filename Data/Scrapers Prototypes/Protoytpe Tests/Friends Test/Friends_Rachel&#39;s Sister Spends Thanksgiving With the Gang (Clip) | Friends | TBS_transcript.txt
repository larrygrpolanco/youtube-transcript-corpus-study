Oh my God, you're on days of Our Lives.
Yeah. Oh, wow.
They must put a lot of makeup on you.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Okay.
So welcome. Is this the first time you're
seeing Emma?
Yeah, I think so.
It's nice to meet you, Emma.
Phoebe.
Oh, that's a funny noise.
I still need some help here.
Oh, right. Okay.
Okay. So it's not just the lie you tell, but
it's the way you tell it. For example, if
you look down at the ground when you're
talking, people know you're lying.
Oh, I don't know why this is so hard for me,
you know? I mean, lying is basically just
acting. And I am a terrific actor.
You are a terrific actor.
Hey. Where's the baby?
Oh, we just put her down for a nap.
Listen, I was just thinking, you know, it
would be incredible if you guys died.
Thank you. Amy.
No, no. Then I would get the baby.
I mean, you know, it would be just like a
movie. Like, at first, I wouldn't know what
to do with her. And then I would rise to the
occasion, and then. Then I'd get a makeover,
and then I'd get married.
That's a great movie.
Now, listen, not that you guys could stop me
or anything because, you know, you'd be
dead. But I was thinking about changing her
name. I'm just not really a big fan of
Emily. Emma.
Emma. Ross wants you.
Phoebe. Why does she keep making that noise?
Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but
if something were to happen to Ross or
myself, you wouldn't get the baby.
Well who would?
Well, we haven't officially asked them yet,
but we would want Monica and Chandler.
I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
Oh, my God, I'm so moved.
I don't believe this. Hold on a second.
You guys die, and I don't get your baby.
Look, Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and
Chandler. We see them every day.
And truthfully, honey, you don't seem very
connected to the baby.
Connected to what?
She's. She's a lump.
You know, guys, I've got to say, this means
so much to me.
I mean, that you would trust me with your
child. I mean, we all know that Monica and
I've been trying to have a baby of our own,
and I've had my doubts about my skills as a
father, but. The U-2, the U-2, this guy.
Seriously.
Okay, it's time for dinner, everyone.
We're using our fancy China and it's very
expensive, so please be careful.
Whoa whoa whoa.
Okay, just to be clear, comedy with the
plates will not be well-received, huh?
Hey, how come my plates?
Less fancy than everyone else's.
Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
No, honey, that's a special plate.
See, it's a game.
Whoever gets that plate wins.
I can't believe I won.
This is such a slap in the face.
I mean, I'm your sister and you would give
your baby to these strangers over me.
Monica is Ross's sister now.
Ross's sister was really fat.
That was me. Now, she was this really dorky
girl in high school who used to follow
Rachel around like a puppy.
Amy, you've got to stop doing that.
Listen, I know that you're having a little
bit of a family crisis, but you don't have
to take it out on the plates.
In fact, I think that that everyone should
cut their food like this.
Now, see, this way you protect the plates.
And let's face it, you have fun.
Okay, how about this?
If you guys die and the crazy plate lady
dies, then do I get the baby.
With crazy platelet? If Monica dies, then I
would get Emma right.
Well, actually.
Actually. What?
It's just. It's just that in that case, then
Emma would go to my parents.
What hurts, doesn't it?
Who has to die for me to get her?
