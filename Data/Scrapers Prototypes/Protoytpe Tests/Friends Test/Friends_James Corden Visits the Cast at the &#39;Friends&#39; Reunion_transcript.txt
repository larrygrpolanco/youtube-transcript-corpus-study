CHANDLER AND JOEY'S APARTMENT,
THEN FOR AWHILE IT WAS RACHEL
AND JOEY'S APARTMENT IT IS SO
WEIRD, I FEEL MORE NOSTALGIC
THAN IF I WAS GOING BACK TO AN
APARTMENT THAT I EVER LIVED IN.
GENTLEMENY'S BED TIME PAL, IF I
TAKE HIM AND EXPLAIN TO YOUNG
PEOPLE, THIS IS A CD.
A PHYSICAL OBJECT THAT YOU OWN,
YOU WOULD HAVE IT AND IT WOULD
BE YOURS FOREVER.
OH MY GOD, LOOK.
I ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT WAS
AROUND HERE.
I AM ALWAYS WONDERING.
LOOK, AND SOMETIMES THEY WOULD
HAVE TO DO.
THIS THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO LIKE,
THIS THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO-- AH.
OH MY GOD.
LOOK.
NOW I SHOULD EXPLAIN TO THE
YOUNG PEOPLE, THAT, THIS IS A CD
PLAYER.
THOSE CD'S THAT ARE IN JOEY AND
CHANDLER'S, YOU WOULD PUT THEM
IN HERE, AND THEY WOULD PLAY
MUSIC.
IT IS AMAZING WHEN YOU THINK OF
ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE SHOT IN
HERE.
LIKE EVERY CORNER THAT YOU ARE
LOOK, YOU ARE REMINDED OF A
GREAT SCENE OR A GREAT MOMENT OR
A GREAT THING.
IT IS REALLY MIND BLOWING BEING
IN HERE.
LOOK AT THAT.

TRYING TO KEEP IT TOGETHER AND
BE COOL ABOUT THIS.
BUT I'M OVERWHELMED AT HOW
INCREDIBLE IT FEELS TO SEE THESE

BEFORE.
SO I CAN'T BEGIN TO THINK HOW
YOU WOULD ALL BE FEELING BACK
HERE SPENDING TIME.
LIKE MATT, HOW DOES IT FEEL JUST
BEING IN THIS SET RIGHT NOW?
>> WE TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT
BETWEEN OURSELVES, YOU KNOW, IT
WAS GREAT TO SEE EVERYBODY.
BUT ME PERSONALLY, I DIDN'T SORT
OF ANTICIPATE HOW MUCH BEING ON
SET WAS GOING TO HIT ME.
AND IT IS JUST, WE SPENT A LOT
OF TIME IN THESE SETS, HAD A LOT
OF LAUGHS.
SOME OF IT IT MADE IT ON THE
CAMERA BUT THE FUNNIEST STUFF
HAPPENED BETWEEN US THAT NEVER
MADE IT TO TV, THOSE ARE LIKE
THE MEMORIES WE KEEP TALKING
ABOUT.
REMEMBER WHEN THIS HAPPENED,
REMEMBER WHEN THAT HAPPEN,
AMERICA NEVER, OR THE WHOLE
WORLD NEVER SAW SOME OF THAT
STUFF BUT WE HAD A LOT OF, THE
SIX OF US, THESE FIVE PEOPLE
RIGHT HERE, MEAN THE WORLD TO
ME.

A LITTLE GAME CALLED THE BEST
FRIENDS TEST.
SO YOU JUST POINT TO THE FRIEND
THAT YOU THINK IS THE ANSWER.
