massage little did she know god was
thinking okay but that's it
oh but the weirdest thing was okay um

me

i think when your wife's spirit left her
body it um
kind of stuck around in me

yeah okay you don't have to believe me
but um
can you think of any unfinished business
she might have had like any reason she'd
be hanging around
well i don't know what to tell you there
the only thing i could think of is that
she always used to say that before she
died she wanted to see
everything everything everything
whoa that's a lot of stuff oh wait i
i remember she also said she wanted to
sleep with me one last time
[Applause]
i'm sorry there's laughing in my head
