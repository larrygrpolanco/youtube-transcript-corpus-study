- Hi.
- Wait.
You're supposed
to wear a costume.
I am.
I am a woman
who spent a lot of money
on a dress
and she wants to wear it
because soon she won't
be able to fit into it.
- Oh, I'm Catwoman..
- Oh.
Who wants to borrow the dress
when you're too big for it.
Okay.
- 'Trick or treat!'
- Oh, oh!
Can I give out candy? I really
want to be with kids right now.
You know, ever since
I got pregnant
I-I have the strongest
maternal instincts.
- 'Trick or treat!'
- Just a minute!
Whoa! Oh! Look at you guys!
Wow!
- You are a very scary witch.
- Thank you.
And you are a very funny clown.
And you are so
in style right now.
You know, I work at Ralph Lauren
and the whole fall line
has got this
like Equestrian theme going on.
I don't suppose you saw the
cover of British Vogue, but--
Can I just have the candy?
Yeah. Sure.
Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again.
So we do, Supergirl.
No, it's me, Phoebe.
Monica, can I talk
to you for a second?
Listen, I appreciate
you getting me the costume..
Oh, you did this to him?
What? I thought he'd love it.
His favorite kid's book
was "The Velveteen Rabbit."
"The Velveteen Rabbit"
was brown and white!
Well, it was either a pink
bunny, or no bunny at all.
No bunny at all.
Always no bunny at all!
- Hey.
- You didn't dress up either?
Yes, I did. I'm Chandler.
Dude, what happened?
- How is that me?
- 'Okay.'
[clears throat]
I'm Chandler.
[growling]
Oh! That is so you!
When have I ever done that?
"When have I ever done that?"
[growling]
[laughing]
[knock on door]
- 'Trick or treat.'
- Oh.
Oh, well, you're just
the prettiest ballerina
I've ever seen.
Thank you.
Oh, wow! That deserves
another piece of candy.
Thank you.
Well, I have to say,
that earns
two-two pieces of candy.
I love you!
Oh! Oh!
Aw!
Aw, honey, here, take it all.
Monica? We need more candy.
What? There's only been
like four kids.
Yeah, I know, but one of them
just said that she loved me
so I just gave her everything.
Oh, no wonder you're pregnant.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What are you supposed to be?
Remember the Russian
satellite, Sputnik?
Well, I'm a potato..
...or a spud..
...and these are my antenna.
So Sputnik becomes..
...Spud-nik! Spud-nik.
Wow! I don't have
the worst costume anymore.
Hey, alright!
Ross came as doodie.
- No, I'm-I'm not doodie.
- No, space-doodie.
