Oh, my God.
I'm going out with Eric.
Ooh, this day is really
gonna be so much better
than I thought
it was going to be.
Oh, Ross, I can't make lunch.
So, apparently
I'm available for lunch.
I can't. I'm busy.
I'm apartment hunting.
You're moving?
Yeah, I can't live with Joey
once the baby comes.
I don't want my child's first
words to be, "How you doin'?"
So, does-does
Joey know you're moving?
Well, I haven't
discussed it with him yet
but I know,
he's gonna be relieved.
Last week,
he brought this girl over
and I started talking to her
about morning sickness
and then I showed her pictures
from my pregnancy book.
That's not really porn.
Not so much.
Hey, you know what,
if you're looking for a place
I just heard in the elevator
this morning
that a woman
in my building died.
Oh, my God.
Was she old?
Does she have a view?
Well, I don't know, but how-how
great would that be, huh?
You living in my building.
I could help
take care of the baby.
I can come over whenever I want.
With your permission.
Yeah, that would
really be great.
Yeah.
Well, can we see it?
Oh, maybe we shouldn't.
I mean if she just died
this morning, out of respect.
Yeah. No.
No, you're right.
- Shall we?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
- Hi. I'm Ross Geller.
I live in the building.
And I'm Rachel
an admirer of the building.
I-I heard about
Mrs. Verhoeven passing away
and I'm so sorry for your loss.
She didn't pass away.
What?
My mother's still alive.
Oh, thank God.
It looked like we were gonna
lose her this morning
but she's a tough old bird.
- Ah.
- Ah.
Are you close with her?
[chuckling]
Of course.
Uh, yeah, she and I would
talk all the time
in-in the laundry room.
You speak Dutch?
[speaking in Dutch]
You know, I would,
but it's just too painful.
So, she's really not dead.
No, she's hanging in there.
Hmm.
Do you think, could you tell me
if she's hanging in
in a, in a one bedroom or a two?
Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner
is incredible.
Where'd you get it?
Oh, well, umm..
I make it myself!
It's two parts ammonia
and one part lemon juice.
And now
the secret ingredient is..
You know what?
We just met.
Okay.
Uh, I'm gonna go get the clothes
from the laundry room now.
And, when I come back I'll clean
behind the refrigerator.
[chuckling]
I love her.
I'll be back in a minute.
Okay.
See, I told ya'.
She stole my jeans!
What?
I have been looking for them all
week and she is wearing them.
So, she stole your pants
and then she came back
and wore them in front of you?
Don't you see?
It's the perfect crime!
She must've been planning
this for years!
I will prove it to you!
Okay?
About a week ago,
I was wearing those jeans
and I dropped a pen
on my lap
and it left an ink stain
on the crotch.
Now, when she comes back
I will find it
and show you that stain!
Honey, isn't it possible that
the company that sold the jeans
made more than
just the one pair?
I guess.
So, shouldn't we go give her
the benefit of the doubt
before we go..
...snooping around her crotch?
Fine.
I'm just glad I didn't give
her my secret ingredient.
[laughing]
Out of curiosity,
what is your secret ingredient?
[chuckling]
Yeah.
Look, I like you, but it
shouldn't be this hard.
