to produce one pound of coffee beans
Farmers need to harvest more than 1500
of these cherries
each one contains two seeds that will be
sorted processed and roasted
before they reach your cup
in 2022 the average U.S price for a
pound of coffee was 5.89
but there's a specialty category called
single origin coffee that can easily
cost over 30 dollars per pound
some exclusive harvests cost over 80
dollars per pound so what makes this
coffee so special and why is it so
expensive
it's November in Erie County Kenya and
the coffee Harvest is in full swing
there are over 12.5 million coffee farms
in the world almost 95 are owned by
smallholders like Joseph
he runs a one acre Farm part of which he
inherited from his parents
coffee is all about equality if you
produce coffee with a higher quality the
higher prices you get for your coffee
coffee grows differently depending on
the altitude climate soil and sun
Farms here sit around 1700 meters above
sea level in Rich volcanic soil the
coffee grow very slow they take long
time to mature coffee take time to
mature the better the quality almost
everywhere every farmer is growing
coffee
high altitude coffee produces fruity and
floral flavors
drinking coffee brewed from Beans
exclusively from one region ensures that
those distinct flavors come through it's
what's called single origin coffee the
quality and unique taste are the biggest
reasons it can cost so much
but achieving that quality isn't easy
the terrain here is too uneven for
machines so farmers pick the coffee by
hand
one Cherry at a time
for coffee ripeness is key

Mary has been growing coffee for over 25
years

50 something
each branch has ripe and unripe cherries
so she has to pay close attention while
picking
the way coffee is harvested here in
Kenya is very different from how it's
done in Brazil the world's largest
coffee producer on huge farms with flat
terrain the Harvest is mechanized
the trees are at a lower elevation and
the yields are higher
mechanized production is more efficient
but this efficiency can hurt quality
control
when the whole tree is picked at once
ripe and unripe cherries are lumps
together
this is commodity coffee destined for
mass production and Industrial use its
price is low and volatile
the highest quality coffee is called
specialty coffee
this coffee has unique attributes that
expert tasters called Q graders rate the
highest
single origin coffee is often rated at
the highest end of specialty coffee
because of its distinct flavors
both specialty coffee and a lot of
commodity coffee come from the same
plant Cafe Arabica but not all arabica
coffee is created equal
this can of ground coffee is 100 Arabica
it costs around eight dollars a pound
in 2022 a single origin coffee grown in
Panama sold for over six thousand
dollars a pound at auction
also 100 Arabica
the better the flavor and the smaller
the Harvest the more expensive the
coffee
back at Mary's Farm there's still work
to be done
after harvesting workers sort the
cherries to weed out any defects
these negatively impact the flavor and
lower the price of the coffee
but they need to work quickly processing
coffee soon after harvest is key to
maintaining its quality

processing infrastructure is expensive
so most farms in Kenya share centralized
facilities
over a thousand Farmers from the region
bring their coffee here
each processing method has a different
impact on taste
but they all have the same end goal
separate the seed from the fruit
these are the five stages of coffee
processing the red cherry the wet
parchment dry parchment green coffee and
roasted coffee beans
this is the washed process it's the most
common way to process coffee in Kenya
after weighing and inspecting the coffee
workers remove the outer skin in a
process called depulping
then they place it in fermentation tanks
where it rests for 12 to 14 hours
fermentation breaks down the mucilage
the sticky inner layer of the fruit so
it can be washed away
the next day workers push coffee through
a series of channels cleaning off the
seeds
this is also where one of several
grading processes takes place
workers separate lower quality less
dense beans which float to the surface
even though these beans sell for Less
they still provide important income to
producers
the denser coffee flows to soaking tanks
to ensure any remaining mucilage is
removed
once the seed is free the coffee flows
out of the tanks and onto drying tables
Roasters sell coffee either as a blend
of beans from different countries or a
single origin but there's no officially
agreed upon definition of the term it
can refer to a form a Cooperative or a
country consumers who buy this type of
coffee are usually seeking a particular
flavor or aroma
the costs of processing transportation
and running a roasting business are all
bundled into the price customers pay for
coffee it's so expensive to get coffee
here everything from the barn to the
port everything has gone up the boxes
where we ship your coffee first
subscriptions or at home consumption
that packaging has gone up with single
origin single producer when you have the
producer's name it's an indicator that
we paid more for that coffee because of
the relationship if you're paying in the
range of 21 to 26 dollars it's because
we've invested in these areas that are
important to us and we hope are
important to them
companies like metric play an important
role in the coffee supply chain
most coffee is consumed outside of the
country it's produced in and how coffee
is roasted has a big impact on its taste
getting the best flavor out of single
origin coffee requires careful roasting
coffee is roasted in big machines like
this
Roasters take green coffee and heat it
evenly to develop its flavor
this is 20 pounds of Costa Rican honey
processed coffee from solisi Cordero
which is the husband and wife team in
terrazoo
horror uses sight smell and sensors to
track how the roast is developing
finding the ideal roast level for each
coffee is a skill that takes years to
master
this drawer that I'm using is called the
Trier and it allows us to see the color
of the development as we go through the
rose
and also to smell how the coffee is
smelling the green coffee will smell
kind of like hay or grass you'll smell
it gets sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
you can smell some of that acidity come
out it'll smell almost vinegary-ish as
soon as that vinegar starts to fade just
a little bit and there's a sweet
fruitiness and a sweet baked goodness
that's our finished development
metric roasts coffee for an average of
11 minutes before horror releases it
into the cooling tray to stop the
roasting process
by comparison commodity Coffee Roasters
favor a darker roast which can cover up
defects and make a blend of beans from
different countries taste more uniform
while dark roasts are generally bitter
medium and light roasts offer more
sweetness and bright acidity
you can blast it for a minute and a lot
of commodity coffee is just blasted as
quick as possible but it really rushes
through all of those phases that develop
over the flavors going through those
steps to get exactly the best qualities
out of that cup we don't add anything to
Coffee everything was intrinsically
there as the raw product from the farmer
from the growing conditions
light roasts also highlight the unique
flavors of a region allowing two single
origin coffees to taste very different
the tricky part about single origin
versus blend is that you can achieve
Stellar results with Blends and
sometimes really subpar with single
origin and the same thing can be the
other way around
how a coffee is processed can have a
have an impact on its flavor and price
the washed process produces delicious
coffee but it's expensive and can be
wasteful
we use a lot of water and there is a
many challenges how to dispose that
waste water but we are trying to work
our net by recycling the water we are
using
after spreading out the coffee workers
move it to a clean set of tables
where they continuously turn it by hand
this coffee takes around 14 days to
reach a desired moisture content over 11
to 12 percent
the goal is uniform beans free of
defects
coffee at this stage is called parchment
coffee because of the paper-like layer
of material that surrounds the seed
before producers ship the coffee they
Mill it to remove the parchment
this is a small machine used for local
consumption when Milling large
quantities the coffee goes through
another round of grading
each country has its own methods of
grading in Kenya each Bean is classified
by size the shape and color of the bean
also impact the grade but often the
larger denser beans are the most
expensive
after months of work producers are left
with what's called green coffee
this is the product that will be
exported and roasted in consuming
countries
but this is also when the process
becomes more opaque
Farmers don't always know how much a
buyer pays an exporter so they don't
know if they're being cut out of
potential profit
The Benchmark for the price of arabica
coffee follows What's called the Sea
Market
it's an exchange like the stock market
where traders buy and sell contracts
based on the expected future value of
coffee
but it doesn't consider the quality of
the coffee and the price is volatile
which makes it hard for Farmers to
operate sustainably
in 2019 the average closing price was
one dollar and two cents per pound its
lowest point that year 87 cents
despite inflation and increased cost of
production the Sea Market is almost the
same as it was in 1980.
Joseph is able to operate profitably but
that isn't the case for many farmers
around the world
a 2019 study found that 44 of
smallholder coffee farmers were living
in poverty
specialty coffee is bought at a premium
above the commodity price
Joseph makes around three dollars and
eighteen cents a pound
due to the high quality of our coffee
there is a lot of demand but our
expectation is that the demand should go
with higher prices
he says 4.55 cents a pound would be more
sustainable but his prices have actually
decreased over the past few years
I don't know the reason why mostly
reacted World Market has flooded their
coffee but we still need more
explanation on why the coffee is going
down when we are still trying our best
to maintain our quality coffee
for those who are producing less than 5
kilos from One Tree they are not even
breaking even the effort we make to
produce latic quality coffee I can say
we are not well compensated by those
prices
growing coffee requires steep
Investments which don't always pay off
for farmers
many Roasters in the industry are
working towards direct trade
Partnerships that benefit the coffee
producer
I'm looking to do two things Source high
quality coffees but also establish
year-over-year relationships
some Roasters also publish the prices
they pay for green coffee but the level
of transparency varies
Wheels Roasters need to do our job to
educate consumers as to the difference
between a product from Colombia that's
Source barely the source with full
transparency in a product of Colombia
that has no traceability and is cheap if
it's cheap coffee that means that
somebody in the supply chain is not
making it and it's chances are it's
going to be the producer they're the
ones that lost
at retail coffee from this region of
Kenya has sold for 22.50 for a 12 ounce
bag that's over nine times what the
farmers are paid
but just comparing those two numbers
doesn't tell the whole story
even when producers are paid a premium
there will always be a markup between
coffee cherries and roasted coffee
Roasters typically pay more for single
origin coffee but there's no definitive
premium
the real truth of it is that you can buy
copied at commodity pricing that
actually meets specialty standards for
so long the market has been so low and
then the quality has been so high that
producers need to sell their coffee they
need to earn a living because if they're
not earning enough to cover the cost of
production not earning enough to just
meet the minimum requirements to have a
decent way of life they're going to be
edged out that is what's happening all
over the world
many throughout the specialty coffee
are working towards more transparency
better pay for producers and more access
to research and best practices
ultimately when coffee prices are low
the producers are the ones hurt the most
foreign
