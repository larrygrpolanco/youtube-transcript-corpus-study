The most notable of these ideas being that the Italians should see themselves
as a single people and dismiss any foreign intervention.
Naturally, this upset the many
 
earning them the title "reactionaries." The years following the Vienna

the Carbonari in the South. In 1820 and 1821,

of a new constitution and those on Sicily demanding independence
for the island.
Basically, no one in these revolutionary movements could agree
on anything. And the Austrian army, soon after, come down and crush them.
