films are made up of sequences
sequences are made up of scenes
and scenes are made up of shots

in previous episodes we covered frame
rates
camera movement
and editing techniques
today we'll look at the elements within
the shot that make up its composition

composition elements
now let's begin
simply put
composition is the arrangement of
elements in an image
it is not only what you include in a
frame
it's the relationship between those
elements that creates the overall
meaning
this concept began long before motion
pictures when images needed to tell a
complete story in a single frame
consider how much storytelling can be
done in one image
we have characters
a situation
a power dynamic
a sense of drama
theme
movement
composition also relies on aspect ratio
the size and shape of the image itself
in fine art portraits are more naturally
composed vertically while landscapes
benefit some horizontal compositions
likewise in film while the basic
elements of composition always apply
there are different considerations
between a squarish frame and a
rectangular frame
understanding these elements is key to
understanding composition
and now
our first element
points
composition is all about directing the
viewer's eye and points in an image are
immensely effective in this regard
focal points whether they be points of
intersection or just a small dart can be
used to draw an eye's attention
[Music]
where does your eye go in this shot from
road to petition
notice how the composition draws our
eyes to the focal point
using points to direct attention is a
popular technique in wide shots
filmmakers will often use an uncluttered
canvas so that naturally our eye goes to
the point
but points aren't relegated to whites
here our eye is directed to the point of
a sword
points are often used in conjunction
with the rule of thirds
the rule states that the subject of a
frame should be placed at one of the
four intersections of the vertical and
horizontal thirds of a shot
[Music]
another compositional technique that
uses points is the golden triangle
this is created when you draw a diagonal
line from corner to corner and then
lines from the other two corners
intersecting at right angles creating
two balanced focal points
[Music]
points are a remarkably simple way to
get your audience to focus on a
particular area of your composition
especially in tandem with our next
element lines
lines are the fundamental building
blocks of composition
vertical lines can suggest height and
strength
horizontal lines can suggest distance
and calm
diagonals can add an off-tilted energy
to a frame
while curved lines can make more
graceful compositions
you can also use leading lines to pull
the eye in a certain direction
here christopher nolan uses the lines of
a hallway to draw our eye directly to
the subject of the frame
[Music]
in raging bull scorsese uses the ropes
and lens flares to point directly at
jake's opponent
lines in composition create a sense of
direction and mood
and when combined they create an
entirely separate element of composition
shapes
shapes make up our visual reality so
it's no surprise that they are important
in composition
triangles
circles
squares
all bring a kind of visual unity to the
image
a clean geometric shape can add a tidy
and satisfying feeling to a frame as if
everything is in order
whereas irregular or organic shapes can
feel more natural
or even chaotic swap it if you don't
pick it
up your
foot move it
shapes can also create frames within
frames
giving the viewer a smaller area of
focus within an image
these secondary frames can evoke
anything from claustrophobia to comfort
all depending on the shape
where it's placed
and the context of the scene
shapes are used to build structures but
our next elements have more to do with
sensations
textures and patterns
like shapes textures and patterns also
help shape and inform how we read an
image
every object has a texture
smooth patterned
or somewhere in between
texture is often achieved through the
collaboration between cinematographers
and production designers
even light can add different textures to
an image
texture can be used to have a subject
pop from the background
or blend in
notice how busy the texture in this
composition from barry linden is
here texture is used to create an ornate
opulence
consider the juxtaposition of textures
between wally and eve and how it informs
their personalities
[Music]
patterns also play an important role in
composition
power and control
harmony
insanity
all ideas that could be suggested with
simple repetition
and breaking these patterns can be just
as interesting
consider how the pattern is broken in
this shot and what it might suggest
or how the carpet designed in the
shining evokes a disorienting maze
texture and pattern give the audience a
more tangible connection to the imagery
and our next element adds dimension to
the image
space
space is crucial in composition and it
can be split into two categories
positive and negative
positive space is the area given to your
subject and negative space is the empty
space around them
the relationship creates various ideas
or moons
the larger the object in the frame the
more importance it has
from extreme wide shots that leave your
subject isolated and vulnerable
to extreme close-ups that empower them
other than the amount of negative space
the location of it also matters
headroom is the amount of negative space
above the subject's head usually kept to
a minimum
lead room or looking room is the amount
of negative space in front of the
subject which is usually much more than
the amount behind them
but breaking these rules can be just as
effective
[Music]
filling the frame is a technique that
gives the subject most or all positive
space
a form of sensory overload that can
create a sense of chaos
the opposite can be equally effective
a simplified frame can be soothing
or even sad
[Music]
these are all considerations of the 2d
space of a frame
and in the next section we'll add a
third dimension to our compositions
depth
film is a two-dimensional medium
representing three-dimensional space
and the best way to accomplish this
illusion is with depth
we divide this space into three sections
the foreground
middle ground
and background
each of these planes can be used to
layer compositions that create
hierarchies of meaning and
relationships shallow focus isolates the
subject from the other planes
if an object is in focus our eyes will
prioritize it
and changing focus during a shot draws
our attention even further
in this shot the pill is closer to the
lens but we don't focus on it until the
camera does
deep focus referring to a large depth of
field allows for multiple layers of
attention as citizen kane pioneered
here all three planes are employed to
visually create a hierarchy of
importance and power
the mother asserts dominance in the
foreground
the father flounders in the middle
ground
while little charlie plays innocently in
the background
depth is an illusion that turns a flat
image into an entire world
the next element helps keep that world
in order
balance
no matter how you use space or depth the
rule of thumb is that the frame should
be balanced
a subject position frame right with
nothing on the left feels imbalanced
the same effect can happen with a
foreground subject with nothing in the
background
one technique to maintain balance is the
rule of odds which states that when
shooting multiple subjects
it's more visually pleasing for the
group to be an odd number
why is it when something happens it is
always you three
believe me professor i've been asking
myself the same question for six years
the golden ratio also utilizes balance
and there are a few ways to use it in
composition
related to the fibonacci sequence it is
a ratio of 1 to 1.618
otherwise known as the number five
if we draw a rectangle using the golden
ratio and continue to divide it with the
same proportions it creates what's
called the golden spiral
we can actually find the spiral in
nature and it has become a common tool
in composition
artists like salvador dali and
photographers like henry cartier besson
have used the golden spiral to create a
natural balance to their compositions
but you don't need something this
complex to bring the golden ratio into
your compositions
if we take the height of a film frame
and draw a line using this ratio we find
an ideal location to place a subject's
eyes
or the horizon
in this way the applications are endless
balance can also mean symmetry
wes anderson famously will often opt for
symmetrical framing in due of the rule
of thirds or the golden ratio
is that my belt
of course there are times when you want
to make an audience uneasy with an
unbalanced frame
balance helps keep the image organized
and stable
on the other hand our next element can
easily create instability
angle
one of the more under-utilized elements
of composition is angle
angle is perspective
it's about what we're seeing
it's about how we're seeing it
most compositions will keep the camera
parallel to the ground but there are
many opportunities to switch it up
a high angle makes the subject seem
small and less powerful
a low angle does the opposite
an overhead angle gives a more detached
and objective perspective
sometimes the moment calls for a touch
angle tilted to either side along the
horizontal axis
like an unbalanced frame this strategy
can make an audience feel on edge
or give a shot a kinetic energy
for a complete guide to camera angles
check out episode 3 of this series
linked below
any of these camera angles can accent or
enhance some of the compositional
techniques we've already covered
including our final element
color and tone
the use of color in a frame can also
help direct a viewer's eye
consider what various color schemes
bring to the composition
monochromatic
analogous
complementary
or triadic color schemes all have great
influence over how we read an image
color can even overrule other methods of
composition
in this shot from in the mood for love
the background has a busy texture that
normally would draw our attention but
wong kawai uses the juxtaposition of the
bright green of mrs chan's dress with
the red background to make her the
undeniable subject of the frame check

similar to color another important
aspect of composition is tone which
refers to the brightness and contrast
within an image
a brightly lit image has obviously
different tonal qualities than a dark
image
blending dark and light in the same
image creates a more complicated message
and since our eyes are naturally drawn
to the brightest parts of an image
having your subject lit surrounded by
darkness helps keep our focus on them
black swan using high tonal contrast
keeps our focus on nina while also
visualizing themes of good versus evil
[Music]
[Music]
when composing your shots don't forget
the role that color and tone play in
visual storytelling
for more on the relationship between
light and dark check out our video on
kiraskuro lighting linked below
of course all of these elements of
composition can be combined
color can create patterns
tone can create balance
shapes can create depth
and so on
now that we covered the elements of
composition let's see how they can be
used in a scene
[Music]
this scene from skyfall is all about
mystery
as you watch consider the compositional
elements that guide our eyes as we
gather clues alongside bond
[Music]
[Music]
bronzer's down
you need some medical evac where is it
is it there hard drive's gone
are you sure
it's gone give me a minute they must
have it get after them
i'm stabilizing ronson we don't have the
time i have to stop the bleeding
with all of these elements present in
every shot the choices of composition
can feel overwhelming
but by planning ahead with a storyboard
filmmakers can use each element with
purpose to create the perfect frame
