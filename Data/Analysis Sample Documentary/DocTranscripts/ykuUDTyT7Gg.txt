watch out here comes some serious
equipment with a long
cannon-like pipe but why is there a
steel capsule
at the end of the pipe and why the
pulley
this monster seems aggressive high time
to dive down
but there's nothing to worry about this
giant comes in peace
the khan strat is unique i mean we're
the only ones i'd say who can walk on
the riverbed and not get our feet wet
how is that possible what is this
unusual river rhine rarity
the carl strat is a diving bell ship
that's been around for 50 years
and is the only ship of its kind in
europe
and this is what it looks like command
bridge and accommodation are on the fore
ship
there's a pressure chamber in the middle
and what looks like a cannon barrel is a
shaft that leads into a kind of capsule
the diving bell the deck crane with its
steel cables and pulley
lifts and lowers the diving belt through
the divided stern
but how does it stay dry inside the belt
the diving bell is attached to the stern
a special mechanism keeps it horizontal
in any position
the diving bell works like an upside
down cup under water
a compressor blows air inside it and the
overpressure displaces the water
the bell can be submerged to a depth of
10 meters
once it reaches the bottom the men on
the riverbed can do their work without
getting their feet wet
the bell is a kind of workshop
underwater however
regulations dictate that from a depth of
seven meters
workers can only stay down here for
three hours at the most
today a special mission awaits the couch
light the diving bell ship has to
recover a lost anchor that is posing the
danger to shipping
here the rhine passes through a
mountainous region and due to the
gradient there's a strong current
such salvage operations would be
difficult for divers but not for the 600
ton carl start
ryan kilometer 564. ten weeks ago
a freighter lost its anchor here since
then a yellow raft has warned passing
ships of potential danger
but the crew does not know exactly where
it was lost
the captain anchors the huge vessel
upstream of the suspected hazardous area
then he lowers the diving belt
after 20 minutes the bell is ready for
action at a depth of four meters
however yet munsterman and his
colleagues can't start their work
immediately
before they're allowed to enter the belt
they first have to go into this chamber
the bunker-like dungeon is a compressed
air lock
dirk pumps air into it via a regulator
the men have to get used to the over
pressure in the diving bell
and equalize the pressure like during a
flight this is called transfecting
if you want to get into the bell you
have to be in top shape
and have a doctor's certificate just
like a diver
today the men will have to go down to
four meters
with every step down it gets louder and
foggier
the humidity is almost a hundred percent
the bell is controlled from the command
bridge equipment operator ralph
is connected by telephone with lock
keeper dirk
ralph brings the bell into position just
above the rhine bed
the search for the lost anchor can begin
but how exactly does it work
since the bell can only be moved up and
down the entire ship has to be
maneuvered to change
the position of the bell with the bell
lowered
they search the riverbed section by
section
dirk and his colleagues are quite
literally fishing in muddy waters
the salvage operation is anything but
easy
the men have already been working for
hours in this exhausting compressed air
by now the crew has searched the 30 by
100 meter area almost completely
so far in vain but then suddenly a
suspicious
noise from the bell
yes i think they have something the
anchor's coming in
inch by inch the bell slides itself over
the heavy 1700 kilogram anchor
whenever we find something it's always a
great feeling then we can say thank god
we've found the anchor
and the owner is also looking forward to
getting back his 6 000 euro anchor
incidentally the ship is named after the
first president of the duisburg rhine
shipping administration karl strat
and even after a century he would still
be rightly proud
of his diving bell ship
