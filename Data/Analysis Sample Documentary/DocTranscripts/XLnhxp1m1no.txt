which report
[Music]
so you may be aware that
BBC has recently broadcast a documentary
a longish documentary on the Gujarat
rights which also says that Narendra
Modi was the perpetrator of ethnic
cleansing
now this is based on a secret document
that apparently question has come from
we are just to explain to you has come
from the foreign office from 2002.
now
can what is the Indian government's
reaction to it the British prime
minister has spoken but what has the
Indian government said or done about it
you were giving some examples from the
BBC documentary I presumed the one you
talk about was day before
do note that this has not been screened
in India so I am only going to comment
on the context of what I have heard
about the or have my colleagues have
seen let me just make it very clear we
think this is a propaganda piece
designed to push a particular
discredited narrative
um the bias a lack of objectivity and
frankly A continuing Colonial mindset is
blatantly visible
if anything
this film or documentary is a reflection
of the agency and individuals that are
peddling uh this narrative again
it makes us wonder whether about the
purpose of this exercise and the gender
behind it and frankly we do not wish to
dignify such efforts
just to follow up I I I'm kind of
confused as to how can a documentary be
labeled as propaganda if it has not been
viewed in India as you say and also a
very specific question I mean the
documentary does show the former foreign
Secretary of UK then Jack straw on
record saying that there is this cable
that exists internal report that exists
does India confirm or deny this report
is India taking this up the report on
the Gujarat Riots of 2019.
this report with UK which report
the report that Mr Jack straw refers to
in the documentary ah okay
that there is an internal cable of the
UK government
I will continue with that from the Hindu
the BBC documentary also says that that
the Gujarat rats actually led to the
killing of UK citizens of Indian origin
so did the UK government ever take this
up with the Indian government till
before
the death of UK citizens in the Gujarat
riots
human take-up is in what if there's a
legal thing legal thing for the sake of
Justice or damage
diplomatically uh you know I'm not sure
you're asking the right question why
would they take up a case diplomatically
for a death
I mean their citizens like you know but
their citizens dying you know questions
a very broad one I'll try to answer I'm
not fully convinced your question
yourself Smith I try to answer both your
questions look um you can't have it both
ways I am confirming that this as far as
I know is not available for viewing here
I delete a question shouldn't have been
asked to me no but people are happy to
ask me a question which is not to be
viewed in India this is because we have
a high commission we have information to
that video okay so that is not clean
screen here I am repeating again
um we think it's a propaganda piece our
assessment this is a propaganda piece
now how can you say that I am saying it
we have seen it and I feel it's a
propaganda piece I don't know what's the
perspective you could say it's not aired
here true but I happily answering
questions here I'm happy to say it's not
aired in India and I could say I think I
have no comment to make but since you
asked I am responding to it
um the separate question you had about
the comments by uh former foreign
secretary in that and something about
reports that he is suffering look he
seems to be referring to some internal
UK reporter how do I have access to that
and it's a 20 year old report uh why
would I just jump on it now and just
because Jack so straw says it how does
it ended Latin that much legitimacy I
heard words like inquiry and
investigation this reason we use the
word colonial mindset
we don't use words Loosely uh what
inquiry they were diplomats here
investigation are they ruling the
country I I'm sorry I do not agree with
that characterization and obviously
there is an agenda behind him UK
Citizen's death look um
if there are deaths here in our country
they followed by our legal procedure
whether they took it up in 2002 look I
don't have any answer I wasn't around
and I'll have to check whether it was
taken up uh whether that's a formality
of taken up or not whether legal systems
but as you very well know there is a
been a lot of legal process against
deaths that have happened uh during that
time I wouldn't be able to answer
whether it was taken up or not without
checking the facts of that
