[Music]
is this gonna last forever
[Music]
I don't have the energy for people
friends
[Music]
I don't have energy at all
[Music]
I fell out of love with everything and I
convinced myself that everyone fell out
of love with me
I'm a disappointment I don't belong
I'm unwanted and not needed
[Music]
nobody understands me I don't even
understand myself
[Laughter]
[Music]
I feel alone even when I'm surrounded by
people
the emptiness overshadows everything
is this what life is supposed to feel
like
[Music]
time is collapsing in on itself
everything blends together to create one
suffocating loop it's endless
overwhelming
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
I can't breathe
does anyone even know what I'm going
through
do they even care
[Music]
sometimes it's hard to find the right
words
[Music]
and when I do
they are hard to say if you look deep in
my eyes you would have noticed the pain
I'm trying to hide
where were you when I needed you the
most
[Music]
I just want everything to stop the
hurting the despair the panic the
depression
I want everything to stop make it stop
I needed to stop
[Music]
you
[Music]
I'm not worth anyone's worry a mine is a
mess
I can't control
I can't let his show
sometimes my heart beats so fast I can't
even feel the beating at all I feel like
I'm losing myself
and then all of a sudden I feel nothing
to be honest it's hard to be vulnerable
when you thought it was happy some days
I wake up praying for the day to be over
it's life even worth living in these
moments
[Laughter]
[Music]
the questions are endless the answers
are non-existent and just when my mind
spiral attempts to throw me off the edge
I force myself to be still close my eyes
breathe in breathe out
be still
you
[Music]
for so long I thought that these burdens
were my responsibility to care
your burden fatigue loneliness anxiety
depression
it's not your weight to carry
my feelings tell me that existing is
overwhelming but my thoughts do not home
and I do not owe them
[Music]
I am done being chained to the things
that depression wants me to believe
feelings fade but the truth does not my
feelings and darkness tell me that there
is no way out but the light shows me
differently
days will be brighter days will be dark
healing is a process and processes take
time
[Music]
now these are the truths that I hold on
to
exist in the realm of control that you
were made to
stop attempting to control things you
have no power over
don't neglect your feelings but don't
let feelings dictate what is true
let go of what destroys you ask for help
on you do what is good for you
even when you don't feel like it
give yourself a break you are not less
than because of what you feel you are
not your pain
you are what you make of it
light has found a way through my pain
every single time
so now we'll choose to not fight the
darkness I choose to seek the light the
sadness will come the disappointment
will come the pain will come but that
doesn't mean I have to let it destroy me
no matter how happy someone may seem
they have moments when they question it
they can go on no matter how confident
someone may look there are times when
they feel unsure and insecure and no
matter how strong someone may appear
they have days when they feel like
they're falling apart
never think for a moment you're alone in
your struggles you're not a mess you're
human everyone has a story but I won't
let this define life
pain doesn't prevent purpose it reveals
it so now in my darkest moments I will
choose to see the truth and I will
choose to just be be still and on the
truth be still and know be still
just be me
[Music]
you
[Music]
you
