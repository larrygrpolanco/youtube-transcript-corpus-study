[Music]
you'll quickly see that what you are
participating in
this week is not an all-star game it's
an international competition
[Music]
and it is a i'll tell you what it is
it's like a playoff game
we're playing um a team that's coming
here to win and
obviously we are too okay so that's the
fun part about it
[Music]
you all have had opportunities to play
at extremely high levels in your
respective countries
what separates this from anything else
this is probably the most critical point
especially for the u.s team
again uh is the fact that you guys get
to represent your country if we're going
to grow football
across the world and we're going to get
better internationally efforts from usa
football to take a leadership role and
host an event like this is huge
usa versus the world means us americans
who everybody around the world knows us
as a football american football nation
we're competing against the best of best
all-stars from around the world the best
in the us and the best in the world and
they're trying to see if they can beat
us we're trying to see if we can beat
them i think it's it's a huge game it's
very very big we feel like football has
grown internationally a lot over the
last years we feel like we we can
compete at a very high level i mean
we're playing against the best of the
best of the united states when you put
on those pads in samoa you're not just
representing yourself you got a whole
village behind you and uh your whole
family behind you so you're carrying
their name not not just yours it means
the world to me because you know coming
from obviously the u.s you know you get
to play for your own country and this is
you know probably one of the only
opportunities you know i might get at
doing something like this and
representing you know america
and if the us loses it's going to be
pretty pretty uh sad for us because it's
our it's our own game american football
[Music]
we're at the regional trial program for
uh the under 19 u.s national team we
have 150 athletes they've traveled in
from california alabama louisiana to
this football field to compete against
each other for a spot on next year's
roster our fundamental strategy here is
pretty straightforward we're looking for
the top right players we talk about that
all the time internally it's important
to find guys who have the talent and the
skill a lot of kids do around the
country but then you add in the
discipline and leadership and ultimately
the character and that's what equates
the top right players and that's
ultimately the type of kid that we would
ultimately want on team usa well number
one the attitude has been a plus and the
talent level the most of these young
guys are all juniors to be seniors and
they are all very gifted it's a very
very
uh equal competitive situation but the
talent level is high in order to
represent the united states and team usa
we're really looking for a well-rounded
athlete who is a leader on and off the
field a great football player but a
great teammate as well
[Music]
i'm really excited especially this game
leading up to national signing day today
marks for you
the official beginning of your college
career
what a great day for you and your
families
[Music]
i'm very excited i couldn't sleep last
night i
got what i could so now we're here and
it's finally here
when your first stream kid is going to
an sec school
and you can replace him with a kid going
to a big 12 or big ten school that's a
lot of fun as a football coach it makes
you look really good
here in austin texas usa football
bonanza usa versus the world and got
three big time recruits with me josh
atkinson george atkinson iii and matt
hagerty
i'm really excited actually i was the
i was the first one to sign in my class
because i was you know out here i was
excited i called up coach sark and coach
mills this morning i was the first one
they said congratulations and my family
and everyone back home was all you know
fired up
[Music]
probably more so than any other sport it
teaches you a lot of things about
communication
[Music]
teamwork
discipline leadership
and most importantly i think one of the
things that our kids in today's society
don't have enough of is how to deal with
adversity
i'm so excited i mean ever since usa
gave me the phone call that i've been
playing for the usa team against the
world i've been ready to go i mentioned
one people
one
black white fan shall we like one
[Music]
we have to compete against them and it's
great because you can see other players
how they play and where you standing
compared to the others in the world
[Music]
let's go finish them up
they don't score we win
oh
[Music]
it's been a great experience i mean
seven days of football only football
with the greatest persons i've ever met
great football players i mean it's like
a dream
football here is
big so big and it's great to be here and
to play here
[Music]
and the beauty of this is we're all one
football family right it doesn't matter
about the language doesn't matter about
your last name
and that's making great feelings and you
can be proud of yourself i think
so just new experience and new
competition against better players from
other countries
[Music]
the game itself demands
values football values we talk about
those in terms of leadership and
discipline and teamwork and sacrifice
these are things that will benefit you
throughout your entire life
but that game taught us things that now
we carry forward in our life every day
and it's something that is truly special
about this game
