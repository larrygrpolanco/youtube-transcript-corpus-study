nshed's roombeek neighborhood is known
as a less upmarket part of the city near
the eastern border of the netherlands
far from the eyes of authorities
working-class families are living in the
tight-packed affordable housing
on a sunny saturday afternoon in may
2000
the residents of roombik are gathered in
the streets wondering where the cloud of
black smoke is coming from
they seem surprised to hear there's some
sort of production facility right around
the corner
little do they know that living
standards in the neighborhood had been
so low that a fireworks factory was
allowed to operate nearby
out of sheer curiosity the entire
neighborhood goes out and clogs the
street
suddenly roombeek looks like a festival
is going on
the smoke coming from the factory yard
also catches the attention of local
firefighters the immediate response crew
arrive at the scene in minutes but are
blocked from approaching the factory by
hundreds of onlookers
the crowd is deft their pleas to clear
the way as everyone wants to be in the
first lines to see the show
the police have to intervene and push
the people away from the scene
as soon as the path is clear the
firefighters waste no time rushing
straight into the smoking factory yard
danny devries a young cameraman from the
neighborhood is here to capture the
event
having both the street and the smoke
rising from above the rooftops in his
frame he finds himself in an ideal
position
a burst of fireworks into the sky
followed by an explosion suddenly breaks
the generally joyful atmosphere on the
streets
suddenly everyone is awake and alert
whatever is inside that factory is
dangerous and might threaten their lives
while the sound of whistling fireworks
crackles through the air and small
rockets fly all over the place the crowd
flees from the scene devries stands
calmly and records it all
then out of the blue a powerful
explosion knocks him off his feet his
camera is still recording but nothing
can be seen except for a thick smoke of
dust that falls in the neighborhood
the dust settles after a couple of
minutes and everyone recovers from the
shock
instantly the streets of rumbik turned
into scenes akin to a disaster movie
the level of destruction caused by the
explosion indicates the factory was not
an ordinary one
the center of the explosion is the se
fireworks factory one of the leading
firework suppliers to major festivities
in the netherlands
the roomba compound was established in
1976 when the area was already in
urbanized zone
the original facility comprised of a
workshop and 13 storage cells designed
to accommodate 18 tons of fireworks
in 1996
factory owners increased the storage
capacity to 105 tons and two years later
to 159 tons
at the time of the disaster the se
fireworks storage capacities comprised
of 13 bunkers within the central
compound that were built of reinforced
concrete 16 steel containers seven light
concrete boxes and two large hangers
obviously the factory accommodated quite
a large amount of explosive material
which was not unusual considering the
company's high turnover
the problem was that it was just a few
yards away from a residential area
on may 13 2000 at 3 03 p.m
a local fire station received a call for
intervention in the roombeek
neighborhood a fire had broken out in
the fireworks factory and neither
neighbors reporting the fire nor the
firefighters knew what kind of factory
it was
when they arrived at the scene at 308 pm
firefighters noted the ignition of
pyrotechnic material that likely caused
the fire with those sorts of fires being
hazardous the fire brigade called for
reinforcements
they knew it would be a tough job to
keep the fire under control luckily
since it was a saturday there were no
employees inside the factory
the firefighters located several
ignition spots within the main workshop
the fire had quickly spread through and
out of the central compound reaching
facades and the roof of nearby hangars
at 3 28 pm the fire reached steel
containers starting with the one
designated e-2
six minutes after it was set ablaze
container e2 exploded sending many of
the fireworks into the air which
onlookers witnessed from outside
meanwhile the situation inside the
factory facilities grew worse
the fire spread out of control and
firefighters were forced to abandon
their positions and run for their lives
inside the yard was also local
photographer marcel van neuenhofen who
was trying to get a close-up shot from
the fire from container e2 the fire
spread to concrete boxes which began to
explode in sequence
the explosion created a 280 foot
diameter fireball and a pressure wave
equivalent to the explosion of one
thousand seven hundred pounds of tnt
the blast destroyed the doors on the
other storage units which were then
caught by the raging fire followed by a
massive explosion of the entire lot the
epicenter was cell c11 within the
central compound the force of the blast
was evaluated to be equivalent to the
explosion of four to five tons of tnt
it created a huge fireball 440 feet in
diameter the blast was heard within a 9
mile radius
the explosion at the se fireworks went
on to destroy the entire area around the
factory 100 acres in total
400 houses were utterly demolished with
another fifteen hundred damaged fifteen
streets were burned to ashes
firefighters from nearby towns as well
as from across the german border arrived
at nshed to help responders battled the
blaze throughout the neighborhood the
entire day
the fire also consumed the facilities of
the nearby gross brewery with an
asbestos roof releasing the harmful
compounds into the air
throughout the weekend an apocalyptic
scenes rescue teams searched the debris
for survivors
23 people were found dead among them
were four of the first firefighters to
arrive at the scene
marcel van newenhofen the daredevil
photographer was also killed in the
explosion
at the media spectrum 20 the ensched
hospital
974 people were treated for injuries
50 of them were in a serious condition
and were kept for further treatment the
disaster had a devastating influence on
the state of health of both victims and
survivors especially those that lost
their homes
many of them suffered from insomnia
anxiety difficulty coping with
day-to-day life and a lack of
self-confidence for a long time after
the disaster
the material damage was enormous an
entire neighborhood was wiped out the
remaining houses were evacuated and
demolished leaving more than fifteen
hundred residents homeless
the damage was estimated to be 486
million dollars
dutch prime minister vim koch and queen
beatrix of the netherlands visited the
scene promising that the entire nation
would back up rebuilding the destroyed
neighborhood
by all accounts the ensched fireworks
explosion was an unprecedented tragedy
in the town's history only comparable to
the allied bombing in 1943
it caught the whole country's attention
curious to know how it happened as a
result a board of inquiry called the
usting commission was set up to
investigate the circumstances that led
to the disaster
the inquiry was based on three
hypothesis
the fire was caused by human error while
handling fireworks
it was caused by self-combustion of
explosive material in the workshop
or the fire was set up by a pyromaniac
as there were recent arson cases in the
area
six days after the tragedy the
authorities issued an arrest warrant for
the company's two owners rudy bocker and
willie pater
since the factory had a multitude of
safety issues the two were marked as
prime suspects
when the police arrived to execute the
warrants both were gone however that
same day peter turned himself in to the
police followed by bocker the day after
inspectors in charge of the
investigation questioned them over the
number of irregularities in the way
fireworks were stored at the facility
at the epicenter of the explosion the
central compound workshop there were
almost two thousand pounds of fireworks
despite it being an off day at the
factory according to regulations if they
were not being operated with they
weren't allowed to be in the workshop
but should instead be stored in storage
facilities
additionally is problematic was that the
factory housed more explosive material
than allowed and that there were types
of fireworks inside the factory that
they had no authorization to store
in general fireworks are classified into
four hazardous categories according to
their potential to cause accidents
these are
hazard type 4 fireworks they present a
low fire risk
type 3 fireworks have a fire hazard and
minor blast and projectile threats
1.2 g fireworks present a serious
projectile hazard but does not have a
mass explosive risk
and finally the most dangerous category
type 1 comes with a very high hazard
with the potential of mass explosion the
sc fireworks were authorized to store
136 tons of type 4 and 2 tons of type 3
fireworks instead inside the storage
containers and boxes there were only 16
tons of type 4 fireworks and 153 tons of
type 3 fireworks
5 tons of type 2 and 1.6 tons of type 1.
that was more than 160 tons of
unauthorized hazardous materials stored
near the residential area
furthermore there was a series of issues
regarding the safety of the storage
capacities the most obvious was the
inappropriate layout of containers and
concrete boxes in the factory yard they
were packed tightly with no separation
distance between installed earth walls
or any other form of partitioning
prescribed by regulations
two containers were not even supposed to
be there and were not authorized
none of the storage facilities went
through any kind of testing and had no
appropriate detection and fire
extinction devices
in addition the aerial photos of the
compound taken a few days before the
explosion showed the container doors
were left open if that was the case on
the day of the disaster it surely
enhanced the spread of the fire from one
container to another and the resulting
domino effect explosion
ironically just a week before the blast
the factory had been inspected and
determined to have met all official
safety regulations
the safety irregularities still didn't
explain how it came to the explosion
human error was the less likely cause
since there were no workers inside the
factory on that day self-combustion of
the explosive material left in the
workshop was also a less plausible
scenario even though it was a warm and
sunny day the temperature inside the
workshop was far from enough to cause
self-ignition
if it happened an electrical short
circuit from some devices could have
been more likely
one of the arrested owners rudy backer
tried to defend his case by claiming it
was arson
according to his claims the previous
owner of se fireworks harm smallinbrook
had the financial motives to organize it
smolenbrook had sold the company to
bocker and peter on april 27 1998 but
had remained the owner of the land and
buildings which he rented to new owners
under the articles of the buyout
contract
bocker claims smallinbrook had plans to
sell the land to the municipality but
had to get rid of his tenants somehow
the arson seemed like a good choice
indeed the police arrested 34 year old
andre devries accusing him of setting up
the fire in sc fireworks on may 13 2000
but with no connections to smallenbrook
whatsoever even though devries
persistently claimed his innocence in
may 2002 the court sentenced him to 15
years of prison
the verdict was based on witnesses
testimonies traces of powder burns on
his pants and his statements
as it later turned out devries was right
about his innocence
in 2003 the appeals court acquitted him
of arson and released him from prison
the final report of the usd commission
was released on february 28 2001. the
conclusion was that the factory owners
quote committed a number of serious
offenses in terms of pyrotechnic
materials management equipment from
various structures and the use and
location of inadequate structures
as far as the responsibilities of the
local and national authorities were
concerned the commission only proposed a
series of improvements to the system
on april 2nd 2002 a dutch court
sentenced the owners of the se fireworks
to six months for importing and selling
illegal fireworks breaking safety codes
and violating storage licenses
they were also fined two thousand five
hundred forty dollars each for violating
safety regulations however since they
had already spent three months in remand
and had their sentences suspended for
three months they were walked out as
free men
a more serious charge of negligence for
the fire was abandoned
years after the disaster and the trial a
famous whistleblower paul van bouterden
conducted an investigation of his own
he initially claimed inspectors did a
poor job leading the investigation but
then suggested the whole thing was a
huge government-led cover-up
as stated in his reports two detectives
claimed there were problems with the
official investigation
these claims were rejected but the
detectives were fired however an
internal police investigation shows the
detectives were right but the report
about this investigation was never
published
then bouten further reported that the
official information regarding the
unauthorized powerful fireworks in the
storage was based only on a
reconstruction of the disaster by the
dutch forensic institute nfi and tno not
on actual evidence
he concluded that both the investigation
and the report of the usd commission
were made to conceal the authority's
responsibility
nevertheless the government and the
local authorities did their best to
respond to the disaster and rebuild the
roombeek the government offered
substantial financial backing for
rebuilding the neighborhood while the
ensched authorities organized the
execution of the rebuilding plan
aware of their responsibility for the
disaster the local council had no direct
participation in the decision-making
process
but gave over the job to residents of
roombeek
those who suffered the most were able to
decide what the neighborhood would look
like
local authorities were only there to
catalog their opinion
in the end the hopes and wishes of the
public were turned into reality at
amsterdam's p de brown's design roombeek
has been rebuilt into the same warm
neighborhood it once was
at the location of the former fireworks
factory the epicenter of the disaster a
part of the original factory cement
foundation that was destroyed by the
explosion was left in place to be
overtaken by nature although they say
time heals all wounds it will take a
long time to heal the traumas of the
people who survived one of the most
devastating accidents in the recent
history of the netherlands
