[Music]
on the 6th of september 1992 a group of
hunters on the stampede trail near healy
in alaska came across an abandoned city
transit bus
thinking that it might make a convenient
shelter for the knights they ventured
inside only to be repelled by a terrible
smell that permeated the vehicle's
interior
suspecting the worst the hunters radioed
local police who came out and searched
the bus
they found the remains of a man who
would later be identified as christopher
mccandless
an individual with a fascinating life
and a legacy which has lasted for
decades after his death
christopher mccandless was born on the
12th of february 1968. even from a very
young age he was a bright and energetic
boy
he read widely with his favorite
literature being the stories of jack
london and mark twain
outdoor adventure was a common theme in
these books and also a massive part of
christopher's life
from as young as eight years old he took
part in hiking and camping expeditions
that would challenge children twice his
age
although there were happy parts to his
childhood it is clear that christopher's
relationship with his parents was not a
good one his siblings report that his
father was a violent alcoholic and that
there was often physical violence in the
family home
christopher's parents dispute these
claims
but even setting any domestic violence
aside christopher frequently found
himself at odds with his mother and
father
he abhorred their materialistic ways and
felt stifled by the vision they had for
his life
he complained that they were detached
from reality he didn't want to live the
comfortable middle class life they had
planned for him
he wanted to find his own more
meaningful path through life
by the time he turned 22 christopher was
determined to get away from home
after graduating from emory university
in georgia with excellent grades he
finally put his plan into action
without telling anyone of his intentions
he donated the vast majority of his
savings around 24 000
to the charity oxfam then burned the
small amount of cash he had left
he packed a few possessions into his car
a much-loved yellow datsun and set off
on a road trip across the country
for the next two years christopher
drifted from place to place enjoying a
life of freedom and adventure
he lost his car in a flash flood and
resorted to hitchhiking he spent some
months working on a farm before taking
off for the open road again
he kayaked along the colorado river all
the way to mexico and then was briefly
arrested when he tried to re-enter the
united states on foot
and through it all he left a distinct
impression on everyone he met some
people found his determination and
enthusiasm inspiring while others were
unsettled by his restless energy
throughout these years christopher lived
with very little money
he often foraged for food and would get
around by hitchhiking and stowing away
on freight trains
he tended to refuse offers of help from
other people preferring instead to rely
on his own resources even when this
caused him significant hardship he
repeatedly noted that he wanted to
escape from society and live his life to
the fullest out in the wild
during this time he went by an assumed
name alexander supertramp
in his journal he wrote a third-person
description of his new identity
two years he walks the earth
no phone no pool no pets no cigarettes
ultimate freedom an extremist an
aesthetic voyager whose home is the road
escaped from atlanta thou shalt not
return because the west is the best
and now after two rambling years comes
the final and greatest adventure
the climactic battle to kill the force
being within and victoriously conclude
the spiritual revolution
ten days and nights of freight trains
and hitchhiking bring him to the great
white north no longer to be poisoned by
civilization he flees and walks alone
upon the land to become
lost in the wild
the wild that christopher referred to
was alaska a place where he intended to
live off the land for a period of
several months
by april 1992 he had hitchhiked his way
there securing one final ride to a
trailhead outside the town of healy with
a local electrician
on hearing that he planned to hike off
into the alaskan bush the man became
worried by christopher's lack of
equipment and supplies and offered to
drive him into town and buy him more
equipment
christopher refused this offer but did
accept a sandwich and a pair of
waterproof boots
adding these to his meagre supplies he
marched off into the wilderness never to
be seen again
after three days of hiking christopher
came across an abandoned fairbanks city
transit system bus
the vehicle had been hauled out there in
the 1960s to provide shelter for
labourers building a road in the area
and had been abandoned when the project
fell through
after sitting empty for several decades
the bus was now to become christopher's
home
living off the land even with the
shelter provided by the bus wasn't an
easy task
christopher foraged berries hunted local
wildlife and at one stage even shot a
moose although he was only able to eat a
small part of its meat before it spoiled
a few months on with hunger setting in
christopher made an attempt to return to
civilization
only to find that the teclanica river
which he had easily waded across on his
way out was now swollen to the point
that he could not possibly cross it
he was he realized trapped in the
wilderness
tragically although christopher didn't
know it salvation was only a very short
distance away
just 800 meters or half a mile along the
river was a cable crossing that he could
have used to get safely to the other
side
unfortunately with no maps and little
knowledge of the area he would never
discover just how close he had been to a
possible way out
stymied christopher returned to the bus
and soon posted a note on the door
attention possible visitors
sos i need your help i am injured near
death
and too weak to hike out of here
i am all alone
this is no joke in the name of god
please remain to save me
i am out collecting berries close by and
shall return this evening
thank you chris mccandless
august
over the next few weeks he began slowly
to starve to death
there are various theories about how
christopher met his ultimate demise
some believe that he may have
accidentally ingested a poison that made
him too weak to forage
others that he simply couldn't find
enough edible plants or game
whatever the cause though in the end it
was a lack of food that ended his life
he kept a diary until the very end
writing a few brief words to describe
each day
his entry for his 100th day in the wild
paints a grim picture
day 100
made it
but in weakest condition of life
death looms as serious threat
too weak to walk out
have literally become trapped in the
wild
no game
there is no entry for day 113
it is likely that this is the day when
christopher passed away just 19 days
later hunters would stumble across his
body in the bus
the police would be cooled and by close
examination of his writings and
possessions the full sad story would
emerge
the death of christopher mccandless this
tragic narrative has been told the world
over numerous books have been written
and in 2007 the story was adapted into a
phenomenally successful film
many thousands of people have described
the way in which christopher's story
resonated with them noting how it spoke
to their desire to live more freely to
escape the constraints of society or to
reconnect with nature and the wild
at the same time his actions have drawn
criticism
some people including alaskan natives
who live near the stampede trail have
described him as foolish and naive
they point out how severely
underprepared he was to live off the
land and how his vision for his life may
not have been realistic given his
knowledge and abilities
there is nothing that illustrates
christopher's complicated legacy as
clearly as the bus in which he sheltered
during his time in the wild
it remained in place on the stampede
trail for several years after his death
during which time it became a popular
attraction for people who had heard
christopher's story
hundreds would hike out to visit it each
year writing tributes on the shell of
the vehicle and leaving behind objects
and messages in memory of christopher
mccandless
reaching the bus was however no easy
feat
and over the years many would-be
visitors got into difficulty while
trying to find it
some were simply under-prepared for the
hike and had to be rescued after getting
lost on the way out
others reached the bus but became
stranded in exactly the way that
christopher had with the river rising
behind them to cut them off from
civilization
in 2010 a visitor drowned while
attempting to cross the teklanica river
nine years later another tourist also
lost their life by drowning in the same
spot
by this time local police and rangers
were spending a significant portion of
their time rescuing people from the
trail and it was concluded that
something would have to be done about
the bus
in june 2020 an operation was mounted to
move the bus
it was airlifted off the trail and
transported to a safe storage location
before finding a permanent home in the
museum of the north at the university of
alaska
there tourists who admire christopher's
philosophy are able to visit the bus
without taking on the risks and dangers
of the stampede trail
the legacy of christopher mccandless is
an unusual one he was a fiercely
independent and courageous young man who
lived life by his own rules
but he was also extremely idealistic and
underprepared for what he wanted to do
something which ultimately sealed his
fate
his example tragic though it is has
proved hugely inspiring to many
but deadly to some who have tried to
live by it
