have I ever told you the story of The
Old Man and the young boy
well you see the young boy walks up to
the old man and says I want to see the
world
the old man laughs
no you don't
the young boy was surprised by his
answer he said yes yes I do you've seen
the world why wouldn't I
the old man calmly replied because you
don't travel the world to see it
go to Iceland to see it
you go to Iceland to know what it means
to breathe fresh air
even when it takes your breath away
altogether
go to understand how the Earth was made
and feel that power for yourself
[Music]
you don't go to the Faroe Islands to see
them
you go to know what it's like to stand
at the edge of the world
go to meet the locals
foreign
[Music]
you go to grow closer to the wind
you don't go to the deserts of Utah just
to see them
you go to be one with time itself
and listen closely to the sound of
nothing
[Music]
you go to get a little dirty
and taste the freedom of a road so open
it never existed in the first place
don't go to Patagonia
[Music]
to go to experience one of the last true
wildernesses
and exist with nature in its purest form
[Music]
you see we don't travel simply to see
the world
but to feel it
[Music]
to know it
to live it
we travel to understand what it means to
be a part of it
and that
is why you should go
because I promise you
[Music]
you want so much more
than to see the world
hi I appreciate you making it all the
way to the end of the video if you made
it to the end you must have liked it a
little bit this was something I put
together mostly because I was just in my
head and wanted to edit something and
feel creative again so I came up with
this concept and put this together and
it felt good not gonna lie uh this video
is sponsored by myself so if you didn't
know I just released my brand new
immersion Lut collection in partnership
with gamut which is my first ever
digital product that I've ever released
I've only ever uh sold turtlenecks on
this channel so I was very nervous about
putting together a digital product and I
wanted to do it right and so I partnered
with the team over at gamut who has
years of experience putting together
professional high quality level Luts and
this pack in particular focuses on
Travel and Adventure footage and making
it as simple and easy as possible to
take your footage from point A to a very
powerful and intense captivating look as
easy as possible whether you're brand
new to coloring or you're just someone
who wants to speed up your workflow
that's exactly what these are made for a
lot of times these Luts in the travel
World make your skin tones really orange
the classic teal and orange look and
your footage just kind of falls apart
because it's just overly saturated
we really wanted to make these look very
natural very powerful at the same time
and so skin tones hold together
extremely well that was an absolute must
for the collection and people seem
to be liking them a lot so far here are
just some of the reviews that people
have sent over uh about the luck
collection and it's something we spent a
very long time on it is 95 which I know
some of you might think is very
expensive but I personally think it is
extremely worth it one not only because
of the quality of the Luts but you
actually get an entire color grading
workshop on how to implement the Luts to
best suit your needs and I think that in
and of itself is worth the money so if
you want to support me this is the best
possible way you could do it and um yeah
hopefully these just kind of allow me to
make less sponsored videos and allow me
to just make more fun cinematic travel
films like this so grab the immersion
collection it helps a ton and I promise
you it will look good on your footage I
would love to see what you guys make
with it so um that's it
I love you I'm tired
but I'm glad I got another video out
stick around me guys
