It's 8:10!
What's going on here? Are you finished with studying?
Actually Aunty 
Every time I see you you're either on your phone or watching Tv
Exams are on your head and it's not like you're a topper 
You get grades that are just enough to pass
This time don't even get that much 
You're the first girl in our family who is going to fail
Aunty, I studied a lot 
I am prepared with Abacus 
So I thought...
You think you're very smart ?
You don't need to think too much 
What you need is to study!
Look at your father he's a topper
No you decide
You want to be a topper like your father or a failure all your life?
No Aunty I will study 
I will show you by coming first in the competition 
Let's see
Your father is called a human computer 
He has won numerous awards 
Now you decide if you want to be a topper like your father 
Or a failure like your mother who has passed on 
You weren't ever a failure mom 
And nor am I... or ever going to be 
I will win this competition like you and dad 
I'll be  a topper like my father 
I'll be  a topper like my father 
I'll be  a topper like my father 
You've always been my topper my child 
Oh my goodness did I fall asleep?
Tomorrow is the competition 
I still have a lot to prepare and study how could I fall asleep!
I know you must already be prepared my child 
It's also important to sleep 
What if you fall asleep in the exam ?
Did you eat anything?
Actually...
Wow! you won?
I did!
We'll celebrate together once you win your trophy and come tomorrow 
Ok?
But dad...
I'm not listening to anything now 
And I''ll wake you up early tomorrow ok?
Now rest 
Goodnight dad 
Goodnight my child 
850 X 745 ?
6,33,250
6750 X 84 ?
5,67,000
Very good!
Now I'll be a little late tonight in getting home but your aunt will be home 
Dad! keep the testing on please!
Ok!
2354 X 765 ?
18,00,810 ?
You are going to rock!
Yes! Fingers crossed 
I really hope I win 
Yes you will .... now let us pack your bag 
Take it take it come on ... 
Let"s do it !
Yes !
What Happened? Did you Fail ?
Aunty I had prepared a lot for it
But I don't know what happened 
I just blanked out 
I couldn't understand what was happening 
Just a certificate?
You didn't even come 1st or 2nd ?
I knew it !
This would only happen 
Because you're on your phone all day !
What does your generation know about how hard we've worked
And gotten ahead in life 
If the electricity was out we would light a candle and study
Your father has worked so hard to get ahead 
He wasn't on his phone like you all day 
Take a look at my son Montu 
He topped las year in this same competition 
And you ?
You turned out to be a good for nothing 
You're just a Failure!
Sister!
Good you're home
You pamper her too much 
And look what she's done now 
She has Failed and come home
So?
What is wrong in failing ?
You think failing is a good thing ?
My Sister, actually your husband called..
He was asking when about when you  were coming home ?
And Montu has his exams as well , you go teach him
And I'll talk to Arushi 
Alright 
I understand what you're trying to say... I can take a hint 
But remember one thing 
Your children won't go ahead in life unless you pressurize them 
Now it's your choice 
She's your daughter ... you can go ahead and make her a failure 
I'm so sorry Dad 
I've let you down 
I Failed... I'm a big Failure! 
No!
You are not a failure!
My child a failure is not one who loses
What do you mean?
A Failure is someone who doesnt even try...  
And you tried very hard 
But Dad you always win so many trophies 
You always come first 
What?
who told you this? That I always come first ...
But you .. 
Just a minute 
I've failed many times my daughter
Your mom was the one who got good grades 
She was a topper
Sharper than even me in Math 
After having you, she wanted to spend all her time with you
She told me to keep winning trophies 
"My trophy is my Arushi"
Then she got sick
And after she passed away I decided 
Every Trophy I won would be for you and your mom
But winning trophies wasn't so easy 
I failed a lot 
But I never gave up 
Always remember one thing 
You won't see the stars until you fall 
Failure is very important in life 
Failure teaches you to learn more and try more 
Do you know when Thomas Edison invented the right bulb
It took him over 1000 trys
Imagine if he gave up on is first try ?
So never be afraid of your failures
Be afraid to give up 
You're right dad ... I won't give up 
I will try again 
I'm not a failure 
It's just a minor set back 
Now that's my girl 
Now for this try of yours we need to party 
Yes!.. Yay
I've learnt my lesson that failing doesn't mean you are a failure
