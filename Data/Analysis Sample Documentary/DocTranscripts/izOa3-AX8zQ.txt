[Music]
men
and especially women possess various
organs that are optimally suited for the
creation of another human being
[Music]
the ovary possesses about half a million
eggs embedded in follicles
several follicles and therefore eggs
mature in each cycle
the dominant follicle grows to about two
centimeters and defibriated end of the
fallopian tube which eventually catches
the egg moves to the site of ovulation
[Music]
the egg consists of an outer layer
called the corona radiata
underneath is another protective layer
the zona pellucida
both layers must be penetrated by the
sperm cell in order to reach the cell
nucleus that contains 23 different
chromosomes
[Music]
each chromosome contains dna
dna is the blueprint for building our
body cells
eye color body size arrangement and
function of our organs
it's all in there
[Music]
if two identical chromosomes occur in
one cell we can later speak a trisomy
[Music]
the egg cell is transported inside the
fallopian tube with the help of cilia
and mucus produced by glands in the
walls of the fallopian tube
additional contractions of the muscle
layers help to transport the ovum
[Music]
at a speed of about three to four
millimeters per minute something else
makes its way from the other side of the
fallopian tube
sperm cells
thousands of them and barely visible
they all have only one goal
reaching the ovum
[Music]
a sperm cell's nucleus contains the
male's genetic information through
messenger substances emitted by the egg
cell the remaining sperm cells find
their way to the oval
[Music]
the goal of all sperm cells is to
penetrate the two outer layers to reach
the chromosomes
[Music]
do
[Music]
the sperm cell penetrates corona radiata
and zona pellucida resulting in the
degradation of the acrosome cap
upon entering the cytoplasm
fertilization occurs resulting in
activation
activation causes among other things a
structural chains of the zona pellucida
so that no further sperm can penetrate
in addition activation causes the ovum
to complete its second maturation
division
in this process the sister chromatids
are pulled into opposite poles and a
female pro-nucleus and a polar body are
formed
[Music]
the sperm's tail and head gradually
degenerate into cytoplasm
the condensed sperm nucleus rapidly
increases enormously in size and the
chromatin decondenses
thus a male pro nucleus is formed with
23 unreplicated chromosomes that possess
the genetic information of the father
as the two pronuclei approach both
doubled their dna resulting in
replicated chromosomes
[Music]
[Music]
finally synchrome occurs in which the
pro nuclei dissolve and the chromosomes
of male and female are properly aligned
in the spindle apparatus
[Music]
now the cell is called a zygote which is
the very first cell of the new human
being
the stage of cleavage begins in this
process the cell continues to divide two
cells then four then eight
at a 16 cell to 32 cell stage embryo we
speak of a murala since the shape
resembles a mulberry
the cells are still enclosed by the zona
pellucida
thus after each cell division whilst the
number of cells increases the size of
each cell diminishes
finally the blastocyst is formed
the blastocyst consists of a
fluid-filled cavity the cells of the
embryoblast and the trophoblast
the embryoblast is the initial structure
of the new human being whereas the
trophoblast is the origin of placenta
and membranes
let's see the individual stages in the
fallopian tube
fertilization occurs at the end of the
tube
the first cell division takes place
about a day after fertilization
eventually further cell divisions happen
forming the mirala
and in the uterus the blastocyst is
created
at this stage the mucous membranes of
the uterus or womb has already been
prepared for the implantation of the
blastocyst
usually the blastocyst implants in the
posterior wall of the uterus however
implantation can also occur on the side
as we will see in a moment
the blastocyst floats in the protective
and nourishing uterine mucus
for implantation in the uterus the
blastocyst must first hatch from the
protective zona pellucida
then the blastocyst barrels further and
further into the uterine lining like a
parasite
[Music]
[Music]
let's take a closer look at this
the endometrium has a protective
epithelium and capillaries filled with
blood as well as mucus-producing glands
the trophoblast cells fuse with the
endometrium and a central trophoblast is
formed that will nourish the embryo
in addition
hypoblast and epiblast arise from the
embryoblast
the embryo burrows further into the
endometrium rapidly increasing in cell
mass and leaving a wound which may
result in a completely harmless
implantation bleeding
finally the amniotic cavity is formed as
the process continues the yolk sac is
created as well as a non-cellular plug
that is later sealed by migrating
uterine epithelial cells
the trophoblast rapidly increases in
size with the amniotic cavity and yolk
sac remaining relatively small
this gives rise to the chorionic cavity
and the body stalk
[Music]
[Music]
three germ layers form from the
primitive streak and node
this process is called gastrulation
the germ layers ectoderm mesoderm and
endoderm eventually differentiate into
various tissues and organs
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
in the course of the third week of
development neuralation occurs
at that time the foundation for the
central nervous system is laid
the neural groove is formed closing from
the center to the sides at the sides
small bumps called somites can be seen
the neural groove becomes the neural
tube which later forms for example
spinal cord and brain
[Music]
those cells later become the neural
networks which enable us to think
[Music]
[Music]
in the fourth week of development this
process is almost complete
the embryo is still in the amnion which
is filled with amniotic fluid that has
numerous functions
the optic plaques which are the bases
for the inner ear can be seen
and a heart is already pumping blood
through the intra-embryonic blood
vessels
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
the yolk sac and the body stalk continue
to nourish the embryo
[Music]
the chorion is the outer membrane and is
connected to the body stalk
the chorionic villi are surrounded by
maternal blood
this allows them to carry nutrients to
the embryo and nourish it we'll see more
on this later
during the fourth week three pairs of
pharyngeal arches appear
in addition the upper limb buds are
visible first followed by the lower limb
buds
the embryo is now curved in a c-shape
the caudal imminence is till-like in
shape the somites which give rise to the
cells forming the skeletal muscles and
components of the skin among other
things can still be identified
[Music]
the embryo continues to grow rapidly
measuring approximately four to five
millimeters by the end of the fourth
week
the lens placodes and olfactory pits are
formed the later arms and hands as well
as legs and feet can be already well
identified
the hands will develop from paddles to
separate fingers by the eighth week
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
the embryo is about 23 millimeters long
by the middle of the eighth week
the legs will not lose their webbed feet
until a few days after the hands
[Music]
embryogenesis turns into fetal genesis
in the ninth week and in the third month
that is from the twelfth week on the
fetus already has a human-like
appearance
[Music]
the eyelids are closed the skin is
translucent
in the following weeks the fetus grows
and the ossification of the fetal
skeleton takes place so that the bones
are clearly visible on ultrasound images
by the 16th week
[Music]
in addition the body is completely
covered with downy lanugo hairs which
help among other things to keep the
vernix secreted by dedicated cells on
the skin
the vernix protects the skin from direct
contact with the amniotic fluid from
about the 18th week the mother can feel
the baby's movements in addition the
sucking reflex has already been
established
by the 28th week the hair on the head
eyebrows and eyelashes continue to grow
in addition the eyes open
the fetus gains a lot of mass in the
last few months and the latter go hairs
and the vernix gradually fade away
it is also slowly getting tighter and
tighter in mom's belly
at first the fetus is supplied by the
body stalk and yolk sac but then more
and more by the umbilical cord and
placenta
since the fetus possesses both the dna
of the mother and of the father the
blood of the fetus must not mix with the
blood of the mother
the placenta is responsible for this
it is responsible for the exchange of
substances between mother and fetus
the chorionic villi which were
previously completely distributed over
the corion have regressed to other parts
of the uterus the remaining villi are
part of the placenta
maternal blood rich in oxygen and
nutrients enters the intervilla space
via the arteries
veins carry away the oxygen and nutrient
poor blood
[Music]
the chorionic villi extract oxygen and
necessary nutrients from the mother's
blood
nutrients include carbohydrates amino
acids fats vitamins and iron
oxygen and nutrients are then
transported to the fetus via the veins
with the help of the umbilical cord
however waste products also reach the
villi via the arteries
this allows the fetus to release its
waste products such as carbon dioxide
and urea into the maternal blood
the mother's organism then takes over
the excretion of these substances
after about 38 weeks the fetus is fully
developed it measures 50 centimeters and
weighs around 3000 grams
the birth takes place now or in the next
two to four weeks
