at the end of the video ever since the
israeli victory during the wars of 1948
and
1956 the arab coalition
led by egypt syria and jordan was eager
to change the situation in the region
by defeating israel both sides
understood that the conflict was far
from over
and were preparing for the next stage of
confrontation
international interference and the
inability of the sides to find a
settlement
made one of the most iconic conflicts of
the modern era
the six day war inevitable
on may 13 1967 the soviet union falsely
informed egypt about the concentration
of 11 to 13 brigades of the israeli
defense forces
with an intent to strike syria
in response egypt started concentrating
forces along the border with israel in
sinai
and on may 16 demanded that the un
peacekeeping forces
leave the peninsula at the same time
israel refused the request of the un to
deploy the unef
on their side of the border in the next
few days
egypt israel jordan and sudan started
mobilization of their forces
iraq sent expeditionary forces to jordan
and saudi arabia expressed its
willingness to participate in military
actions
but the turning point which made the
full-scale confrontation inevitable
was the decision of egypt to block
israeli ships
from entering the streets of tiran on
may 22nd and 23rd
on june 1st israel established a
national unity government
which on june 4 decided to go to war
the arab coalition of egypt jordan and
syria
had an advantage over israel in deployed
troops
with 240 000 against 100 000
in tanks with against 800
and in aircraft with 957
against 300 israel planned to strike on
june 5th
with operation focus which aimed to
destroy the egyptian air force
israeli media published false reports
claiming israeli soldiers were on
vacation
while their pilots were carrying out
training sorties as usual
their intelligence helped make this
training as realistic as possible
they also damaged the tracking antenna
of the us embassy
to prevent the americans finding out
about the operation
before the strike took place the israeli
pilots were informed about the start of
the operation
only five hours in advance at the same
time
the egyptian air defense system was
effectively off
on june 5th nearly 200 israeli aircraft
attacked 14 egyptian
airfields and caught them absolutely off
guard
338 egyptian aircraft were destroyed
and a hundred pilots were killed within
three hours
the jordanian and syrian air forces
attacked israel in retaliation
at 11 am on june 5th the response of the
israeli air force
was to attack their airfields which led
to the destruction of all
28 jordanian 53 syrian and 10
iraqi planes operation focus
was a decisive success israel lost only
19 planes in this operation
and guaranteed its total air dominance
for the rest of the war
the ground war was taking place on three
fronts
the sinai front the jordanian front and
the syrian front
on the sinai front the egyptian forces
consisted of seven divisions
four armoured two infantry and one
mechanized infantry
egypt had 100 000 troops and 900 to 950
tanks in the sinai
so israel concentrated three divisions
consisting of six
armoured one infantry one mechanized
infantry and three paratrooper brigades
for a total of 70 000 men and 700 tanks
along this
front israel's plan was to catch the
egyptians off guard
by attacking simultaneously with
airstrikes and attacking through the
northern and central routes in the sinai
peninsula
instead of the central and southern
routes used during the sinai war
on the 5th of june at 7 50 am the
northernmost israeli division
consisting of three brigades and
commanded by major general israel
tal started its advance towards arish
through gaza
with an aim to encircle khan yunus while
the paratroopers were ordered to take
rafa initially the egyptians offered
little resistance
since their intelligence concluded that
this was a diversion
rather than a main attack however
soon resistance against the 60th armored
brigade ramped up
this did not stop the israeli forces
from reaching the khan yunus railway
junction
in four hours afterwards the idf
advanced on shia zaweed
and defeated fierce egyptian resistance
thanks to air domination
the road to arish was open and by 8 am
on the 6th of july
elements of the 79th armoured battalion
and the 7th brigade
entered the suspiciously quiet city
suddenly the egyptians started firing
from the balconies and windows
and there was a heavy battle going on
for control of the city
the idf was only able to take full
control of the city
after reinforcements were sent the
northernmost division then split into
two parts
one of them continued the advance on the
suez canal
while the second group turned south and
captured birlafan
and jabal further south on the 6th of
june
the 14 000 man 150 tank strong
israeli 38th armored division under
major general ariel sharon
was confronted by the egyptian 2nd
infantry division
under major general saadi nagib
consisting of 16
000 troops and 90 tanks
israel successfully advanced towards abu
egala
the paratroopers landed behind egyptian
positions
and sowed enough confusion to weaken the
artillery of the egyptian defense
which opened the way for the idf to
capture unkatef
it was followed by a fierce close tank
battle which ended in an israeli victory
with 40 egyptian and 19 israeli tanks
destroyed
the egyptian forces in sinai were still
largely
intact but their field marshal abdel
hakim ammo
panicked and ordered the retreat of all
units from sinai
after hearing about the fall of abu
agala
this order did not elaborate on the
sequence and
manner of the retreat which only
decreased the defensive capabilities of
the egyptian troops
during the following days the idf
continued its advance westward
and inflicted heavy losses on the
egyptians
despite episodic heavy resistance by the
egyptians
as in bin gefgaffer the napalm bombing
by israeli aviation
and the uncontrolled retreat weakened
the morale of the egyptian troops
instead of catching retreating egyptians
the idf decided to capture three passes
from sinai to the egyptian mainland
and face the egyptian troops there
although the idf was not able to stop
all the egyptian troops from crossing
these passes became a killing ground
with ten thousand egyptians being killed
in one day alone the capture of sinai
was completed
by the fall of sham el-sheikh on june 7
and rasuda on june 8. on june 9
the un security council achieved
armistice between both sides
israel wanted to avoid confrontation
with jordan
and syria before defeating egypt but the
office of neutrality to jordan were
rejected
as the egyptian president nasa persuaded
king hussein of jordan
that egypt had an advantage against
israel
on the morning of the 5th of june both
sides started to fire
but israel attempted a last grasp
attempt to avoid confrontation with
jordan
by passing its message requesting peace
through the un representative
bull king hussein countered that it was
too late
and the jordanian air force was already
on the way
jordanian and iraqi aviation started
shelling israeli-controlled west
jerusalem
which caused 16 military and 20 civilian
casualties
with 900 buildings damaged israel
responded with its own air attack within
operation focus
which damaged the military aviation
infrastructure of jordan
and secured israeli air dominance
east jerusalem was controlled by jordan
at the time
and the jordanian army took position in
the un residency
the government house to fire on the
israeli sector
the jerusalem brigades reserve battalion
161 of israel
took the government house despite heavy
losses and forced the jordanians to
retreat to bethlehem
later on that day israel encircled
eastern jerusalem with the jerusalem
brigade from the south
and the mechanized herrell brigade and
55th paratroopers brigade
from the north a fierce battle took
place for ammunition hill
jordanian resistance was so strong that
the idf lost all but
two of their attacking officers and
achieved the goal
only after four hours the 55th
paratroopers brigade afterwards drove
eastwards
reaching mount scopus and defeating the
other jordanian positions around the
american colony
towards the evening of june 5th the
mechanized herrell brigade succeeded in
taking
let's run and ramallah also
the 163rd infantry battalion secured abu
tor
and cut the old city from bethlehem and
hebron
on june 7th the israeli minister of
defense
moshe dayan ordered the idf to enter the
old city
despite reservations and concerns by the
israeli government
the fighting was conducted solely by the
paratroopers
out of fear of destruction of holy sites
the idf took control of the old city
with little resistance
judea hebron bethlehem and nablus
were also captured by the idf on june
7th
remnants of the jordanian army fell back
into jordan
israel was victorious on this front as
well
syria also believed nasa about egypt's
early success in the conflict
and sent its aviation to attack galilee
this attack was intercepted by israeli
aircraft
a minor ground attack was also attempted
by the syrians
hoping to capture the water plants at
tel dan dan
and shiaya shiv this was repulsed by the
idf as well
israeli air domination lack of
communication by syrian units
and tanks being too wide for bridges
were among the causes of the
unsuccessful attack of the syrians
this caused them to abandon any attempts
to make ground offensives on israel
and airstrikes were chosen as their
method instead
however on the evening of june 5th
israel struck syrian airfields as part
of operation focus
destroying two-thirds of the syrian air
force and forcing the rest
out of the conflict the israeli
leadership was unsure whether to attack
syria or not
on one hand syria was using the golan
heights to
shell israel on the other hand it would
have been
a literally uphill battle against a
fortified enemy
but intelligence about weakened
positions of syria in general
and in golan heights in particular led
dianne to order an offensive on golan
without government authorization the
israeli offensive started with
air strikes which severely damaged the
defensive infrastructure
and morale of the syrian army
the eighth armored brigade led by
colonel albert mandler
advanced into the golan heights from
givert hayem
heavy fighting in unfavorable terrain
led to numerous casualties on both sides
but with the help of their aircraft the
idf ultimately captured the zora color
and einfit fortresses
in the central sector the israeli 181st
battalion
captured the strongholds of dardara and
talhilau
after fierce fighting by the evening of
june 9th
israel reached the plateau which allowed
reinforcements to join them
by dawn israel had eight brigades ready
for an assault on the second
line of defenses soon a ceasefire was
negotiated around the so-called purple
line
by the 11th of june all military action
stopped
up to 983 israelis 15 000
egyptians 700 jordanians and 2
500 syrians were killed in action
israel gained a huge victory it seized
the gaza strip
the sinai peninsula the west bank of the
jordan river
including east jerusalem and the golan
heights
about 1 million arabs were placed under
israel's direct control
in the newly captured territories the
israeli victory came as a result of
more efficient military leadership
better preparation of troops
and intelligence but the six-day war was
by no means the last conflict
and merely six years later the
confrontation escalated
into another war the sponsor of this
