You are cleared for initial trust.

And if you don't say make it so,
I'll be very disappointed.
- [Sarah] Noted, Commander.
Please proceed to drive initiation point.
- On my way.
See you soon.
- Ah, he's so fast!
(mellow music)
Someone's excited.
You're looking forward to playing
with your new toy, Commander?
- I am, but maybe don't tell anyone
you call it my toy, honey
They may ask us to cover
the trillion-dollar bill.
Hey.
Look at me.
I'm coming back.
I always do.
I wouldn't do this if I thought otherwise.
- You better.
- You can't get rid of me that easy.
(melancholy music)
(engine humming)
Flight, we are green across
the board, please confirm.
- [Sarah] Confirmed, Longshot.
- Disengaging interlocks.
Flight, we are a go for FTL burn.
It's now or never.
- [Sarah] God speed, Commander.
See you on the other side.
- Come on Flight, let's
hear it, you can do it.
- Fine.
Make it so, Commander.
- [Ethan] There you go.
- [Reporter] The world awaits the test
of the very first faster-than-light
propulsion system.
The Longshot is the most
advanced spacecraft ever built.
And in it, Commander
Kane will travel to Mars.
A journey that, according to NASA,
will take just over three minutes.
- [Ethan] Lighting it up
in three, two, one.

Mark!

Flight, do you copy?
(Mission Control applauding)
- That's right, yes!
- Loud and clear, Commander.
Welcome back to our corner of space-time.
- [Ethan] It's good to be back.
- And this just in!
Commander Kane has
arrived at his destination
and is now the first man to
travel faster than light.
- Thank God!
- [Reporter] The commander will now launch
an entangled satellite
into orbit around Mars
allowing real-time communication
between Earth and Mars Colony One.
(dramatic music)
- Q sat, online.
- [Ethan] All right, let's do this again
before you miss me too much.
- Initiate return sequence.
- [Ethan] Starting FTL spin-up sequence.
- [Sarah] Roger that, Longshot.
(spaceship humming)
- And we are a go across
the board, Flight.
- [Sarah] Spin her up, Commander.
(engine whining)
- Flight, it looks like I may
have an interlock issue here.
- We're seeing the same thing here.
Let's take a look at diagnostics.
Abort FTL drive start and spin down.

Spinning down.
(computer beeping)
Flight, we have a problem.
(spaceship whooshing)
(alarm beeping)
(energy crackling)
(dramatic music)
Flight, I have lost drive control.
Repeat, I have lost drive control.
I have no nav comm and I
am approaching light speed.
- Find him, Comms!
- [Ethan] I am being
pulled in to a new vector!

Warning, hull breach.
Warning, hull breach.
- I need information people, come on!
Where's our bird?
- Gone, I mean gone.
No vector, nothing to track.
We should be able to get him
on Q comm anywhere, but nothing.
- Stand by, we're receiving
some new information.
Commander Kane seems to have disappeared.
- Where did Dad go?
- [Reporter] The Longshot
was ready to make
the return voyage home
but something seems to have gone wrong.
We will continue to follow the story
and provide updates on
any new developments.

Okay, way above my pay grade.

- [Reporter] After almost a day
since his last communication,
the search for Commander Kane continues.
We have reached out for the
Commander's family for comment.
We're sure it's been a
difficult time for them.
Along with the rest of the world,
we hold out hope for a safe return.
- [Sarah] Nothing more to do today.
Go home.
(radio squelching)
- Uh, Flight?
There's something.
- [Ethan] Control, come in.
- You guys getting this?
- [NavCom] NORAD is reporting an anomaly
approximately 2.4 clicks from ISS.
- Anomaly?
Do we have a visual?
- Coming up.
(dramatic music)
- What is that?
(aliens whizzing)
Can you track?
- I don't.
