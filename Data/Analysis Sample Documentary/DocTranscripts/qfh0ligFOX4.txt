police responding to reports of a
shooting
tragedy
i got an automated phone message from
the school
that the schools were in lockdown
and then we got the news that there had
been a report
of a shooting at sandy hook school
and i ran out the door i just
i headed to the school quickly
there was a firehouse down the street
from the school where they they were
having everybody assembled and they were
bringing all the students and personnel
out of the school and having this having
us meet there
[Music]
and
my friend melissa
had collected her
second grader
and um
she asked her husband to
to pick him up and bring him home and i
said to melissa i said you should go
home and be with him and she said no
i'll stay here with you until you get
daniel
and then finally the governor came
and said
if you're missing someone
they didn't survive
[Music]
we have funerals for olivia engel at one
at st rosalina and dylan hockley in
bethel
same thing we've been doing
just be outside respectful distance
is there anything else we need
in newtown daily developments beyond
that happening anything we know there's
nothing else today but dave is gonna be
making some calls
um
yeah one of the teachers
her step father
is a reporter here and i think is sort
of a
defense mechanism i thought it couldn't
be you know we we we'd know already
something and um
eventually
um
it was confirmed so
you know a story that was
difficult enough for all of us to report
anyway was you know that much more
emotional that much more difficult
the sort of
overarching issue that
i'm looking at is whether or not
sandy hook
truly is a tipping point in the debate
over gun violence and that whatever the
solutions are out there these 20
innocent children lost
this will make a difference
and and i'm sort of examining that
optimism against the reality that the
gun control debate in america is
exceedingly divisive
it is a sad honor to be here today
it's been one month since i lost my son
dylan and 25 other families lost their
loved ones
the sandy hook promise is the start of
our change
this is a promise to do everything in
our power to be remembered not as the
town filled with grief and victims
but as the place where real change began
this is a promise
to be open to all possibilities there is
no agenda other than to make our
communities and our nation a safer
better place
yeah uh matthew kaufman with the
hartford current can you give us a sense
of how active you intend to be or do you
anticipate a point at which sandy hook
promise would actually be testifying
lobbying if you will we have to take the
time to educate ourselves we have to
take the time to have that dialogue
but absolutely there's going to become a
moment time where we're going to take
those positions we're a platform for
people to come together with one voice
and actions to move us forward some of
us who came together to start sandy hook
promise our gun owners
we hunt we target shoot we protect our
homes we're collectors we teach our sons
and daughters how to use guns safely
passing a new law and then moving on is
not the answer
we have to fundamentally change our
approach
so that's uh
it's pretty dead center pretty dead
center
a lot of people were surprised at how
many guns nancy lanza owned and the type
of guns that they were
but in fact there's a strong gun culture
in newtown a lot of hunters a lot of
target shooters a lot of gun owners
after december 14th
everybody's been asking has it changed
how i felt about firearms and to be
honest
no
i mean this is how
i thought do you feel yourself sort of
under attack as as a responsible
firearms owner i have friends who are
devout
nra members
who believe that the second amendment
gives everybody the right to own
any firearm
vice versa i have friends here in town
who
believe that all firearms should be
confiscated and destroyed
and i'm somewhere in the middle
as far as a ban on
30 round
clips that that's a it's a common sense
law that would absolutely save lives and
there's going to be a bunch of people
upset that i said that do you feel
uh oh no i'm i'm
betraying
you know the gun enthusiast community
here that uh
i will lose friends
i'm sure of
it we are heading to
the home of a gentleman named scott
ostras ostrovsky
a newtown resident has kind of a
private amateur shooting range on his
property that has been the subject
of a number of complaints by
folks who live in the neighborhood
we've gotten complaints of noise because
we have a neighbor that's been more
sensitive to the shooting in the past
couple years and the police have been
over here many times and they have said
it was safe and we've become buddies
with them there were complaints sort of
from all over the town going to the
police is there something that that
changed a new town yes
a lot more people live here now and a
lot more outsiders have moved in and
these are people that moving to newtown
is big country to them these are people
that in my opinion came from new york
city or the suburbs of new york city or
any urban environment and they're not
used to what goes on in newton or what
has been going on and then you get that
conflict it's just you know growing
pains in a situation like this
each of these red dots represent a home
from which a complaint was lodged with
the police about the sound of gunfire
near these homes i think this was
2010 the first part of 2012.
85 noise complaints related to shooting
spread
pretty broadly throughout the town
so last year the town decided to do
something about it
how are you how are you nice to see you
come in thanks
i think it had just reached sort of a
critical mass of a number of complaints
so
we set this ordinance up and it would
say look you cannot shoot a gun in
newtown unless you're doing legitimate
hunting or you have a legitimate
shooting range did this feel like
controversial
legislation ordinance to you as you were
drafting it did you think not in the
least
absolutely not in the least i never
expected that there would be any
significant opposition to it they had
two public hearings on it
and there were a lot of people there and
they were
very vocal in opposition to the
ordinance
these are the minutes of the meetings
that were held
necessity should be the standard not
simply prudence gunfire is a reminder of
freedom
one person notes that no one in
attendance has spoken in favor
of the ordinance so really you know very
strong emotions
over again what i think the town thought
was a noise ordinance and it all had to
do with their ability to maintain arms
and somehow this would infringe their
second amendment rights any inkling at
all
that you might be uh opening up the
second amendment debate here no because
the second amendment has nothing to do
with shooting ranges it doesn't say the
right to have a shooting range shall not
be infringed
this all happened in the months before
the shootings
and only a handful of people showed up
in support of the ordinance
the town meetings were dominated by
pro-gun enthusiasts
and the ordinance was tabled
and that really illustrated the long
history that newtown has with guns
in fact the trade group for the whole
gun industry is located right here the
national shooting sports foundation
within newtown
is the nssf known
i've talked to a number of people from
town and said had no idea they were here
yeah well connecticut is not well known
now for being a state of great firearms
ownership but ironically connecticut is
where the firearms industry got its
beginning all the major manufacturers of
firearms and ammunition were generally
centered in the connecticut river valley
during the industrial revolution and
that's why the national shooting sports
foundation is in connecticut
2013 marks the 35th anniversary of the
shot show this year over 630
000 square feet of exhibit space and
more than 60 000 industry professionals
ladies and gentlemen
the state of our industry tonight
in a word
is misunderstood
now who among us
has not been moved by that unspeakable
tragedy that was inflicted by a deranged
man upon the children of newtown
connecticut our very home at the nssf
you had said the state of the industry
is misunderstood and what's the biggest
misunderstanding about it
there are many according to the media
we're nothing but a bunch of greedy fat
cats who could care less about anything
but making profit we're in this business
because we love it rather than say that
guns are bad what we say is guns are
here guns are part of the fabric of our
society and so what we need to do is to
make sure that responsible gun owners
make sure that they are not accessible
to children or at-risk individuals if
this woman had safely stored her guns
inaccessible to her son when they were
not in use this shooting would not have
occurred
in the month since 20 precious children
and six brave adults were finally taken
from us at sandy hook elementary
more than 900 of our fellow americans
have reportedly died at the end of a gun
so i'm putting forward
a specific set of proposals
and in the days ahead i intend to use
whatever weight this office holds
to make them a reality
our government is treading a thin thin
line
of becoming tyrannical
and whether it's king george or barack
hussein obama
oppression is oppression
gun control isn't about guns it's about
control
i only have one comment i will not
comply
[Applause]
[Music]
historically with the pro-gun lobby
they've really become entrenched when
challenged one of the questions i think
is do 20 dead first graders change that
equation so far it hasn't and i think
what makes this such an intractable
issue
is even after sandy hook there are
two camps the two camps are what we need
to make our community safer
is fewer guns and the other camp saying
no what we need to make our community
safer is more guns i don't know where
the common ground is
on this when it starts that far apart
we're 48 days
past today when did you start thinking
you have
a larger role to play here
i i
i feel like
we've been forced onto a platform
and i think it i i feel we feel a sense
of responsibility in a field of
obligation a sense of obligation now to
to do whatever we can
we're not political mark and i we're not
you know um
confrontational people
um
but i think we can't we can't allow
ourselves to become complacent and just
say
that's how it is here in the united
states you know these things happen
that's that's unacceptable
[Music]
i have felt guilt and shame about the
fact that in this particular topic i
have never done
a single thing i've been awakened and i
will not be caught napping on the job
from here on out i
just need to do something because i'm
like so many other people
i can't stop thinking about what
happened so
i'm richard morato i have a first grader
at sandy hook by the grace of god she
was shoved in the bathroom along with
her 14 friends and her teacher
i won't begin to tell you the things
that she says and draws right now and
it's progressively getting worse so
anything we can do for our community but
i think we all need to get on the same
page and if someone does speak tomorrow
let's all be on the same page there's a
huge silent majority out there
that i believe is easily motivated not
to be silent anymore if we give them the
tools and that's what we're working
towards
when you go out and you advocate your
power is a thousand one because people
aren't showing up and the fact that
you're from newtown is even more
important i feel like our grief puts us
in a unique position of power and i
actually believe that we can
with that power help level the playing
field with the special interests that
are out there i do think the tide is
turning but our window right now is
extremely limited this is going to move
very very quickly
[Music]
i've never had to wait in line to get in
the legislative office building i've
never had to walk through a metal
detector to get in the legislative
office building so this is most
definitely a moment in my state and the
nation as well
my name is raymond mazza resident of
farmington connecticut
i come here today in strong opposition
of the proposed legislation including
but not limited to
house bill 5268 senate bill 140 senate
bill 122
senate bill 124
and senate bill my daughter was a
student in victoria soto's first grade
class she survived
she and eight other children
ran from that room directly past him
but not before witnessing her friends
and her teacher slaughtered in front of
her so here we are again
another mass shooting another deranged
perpetrator and the response is yet
again banned guns
something needs to change
we need to be able to send our kids to
school without fear as much as you might
detest this thought at the end of the
day the only protection against a bad
man with a gun is a good man or woman
with a gun in the right place at the
right time guns are a fault line in
this sort of varied american experience
and and they
have this capacity to sort of create
this emotional cleave in a way that
i think maybe abortion comes close to
but other than that no other issue
really separates the nation this
substantially if the principal had come
out of her office with a gun in her hand
she might have at least mitigated the
carnage we are incredulous at the types
of assault and semi-automatic weapons
and magazine clips that are considered
legal a lot of people on both sides
think that some change
will come but it will come
not as the result of a meeting of the
minds of these two far apart camps
but simply because one side or the other
musters sufficient political power to
get their way thank you
