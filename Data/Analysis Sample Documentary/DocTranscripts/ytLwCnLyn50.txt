each day around 20 volunteers give it a
try with one dream at heart
to be part of the Great Legion family
hello
I would like to join the League you want
to join the legion nationality Avenues
do you have any toiletries
yes I looked at the website I took a
pair of flappers three Underpants three
t-shirts a toothbrush shower equipment
to be a candidate here you need few
material stuff it is best you are
motivated
engaging is a radical change of life at
21 Stan is well aware it is really
something you wake up one morning and
say to yourself I am going to the
Foreign Legion I called my family I told
them about everything I will go to the
Foreign Legion and for five years they
may not hear from me specifically and I
came here at once Stanley Japanese is
not the only one to give it a try this
morning
at the same time a Spaniard Algerian and
Brazilian come to the nogen fort
foreign
unlike any other the Foreign Legion is
renowned worldwide each year 8 000 men
from all countries come knocking at its
door
it's from now on that the tests will
succeed each other for these new
recruits keep your bag here
place it well on the line here begins an
echo battle on average the legion admits
one candidate on eight
now you will do pull-ups you have to do
your utmost
first elimination test pull-ups an
effective exercise that already allows
the recruiter to Mark the right elements
that is the case with Stan
we see that he is a good athlete
he has a good physical build
at the nogen Ford selection is just at
its beginning
before the next schedules candidates
must make sure to stay fit
on their own initiative physical
activities come one after another
Stanley gavanese seems particularly
involved and motivates the troops
good good good good good one more one
more just one yes
we have to do it we are all in this we
have to help each other we are all in
this together
but the journey is far from over
second decisive stage for candidates
thorough questioning
okay guys all right guys stand up and
follow me
here nothing is left to luck each
candidate's past is scrutinized its
shirts turn to be questioned
from now on candidates must forget their
past like Stan the gavinis the legion
gives them a new personal story
so is all the write down in this table
wait first okay
once you leave here apanga is your new
identity if the Corporal calls out a
panga that's you cool you are a panger
family name apanga name Philip how does
it feel to have a new identity
it's a little mysterious I feel good
it's a little mysterious not everyone
can change identity as they wish that's
just what interests me because I am so
much we will say we are different it's a
bit exceptional
all is good you have understood do not
forget your new identity
as from today you shall be called a
panga yes sir
if we do not like the candidate if he
doesn't meet the requirements what we
require of them it could be sent back
basically he shall not be retained if we
see that his profile is good he
continues with us
changing identity is one of the legion's
tradition Stan becomes Philip Sean comes
Robert and shirt becomes Tony nothing is
decided yet as the days go by tension is
more and more visible
candidates are now subjected to a series
of medical checks the slightest health
problem means immediate expulsion

foreign

at the end of the test the results are
out
a test which seems easy Sean must do his
utmost to stay in the race just after
nine moves he no longer has strength in
his arms
I am very disappointed in myself
is very comfortable
24 pull-ups he smashes the record under
the Applause of his mates
which is frowned upon by the instructor
the next time you this you all leave
where do you think you are at a show in
the theater
go that way
for stand mission accomplished he passed
the tests with flying colors
I couldn't let go I could hold until my
body gave up it was for me the most
important moment to give my all till my
body has nothing to give
it was the most important for me
Behind These Walls each applicant is
interviewed by a dozen interrogators in
connection with Interpol and the world's
police
everything has been checked the phone
shipped bank accounts social networks
the recruits discover that it's
difficult to hide whatever from the
legion
the reactions of the candidates are
carefully observed their answers are
strictly checked
this shredded interview takes place in
absolute secrecy we are prohibited from
filming
after two hours of questioning Stan
shares his Impressions to a recruit who
hasn't been before the commission
you are not going to openly respond you
will try you won't try to justify
yourself you'll really have limited time
to respond that already plays a lot
since you are being questioned they are
not asking for so much details that said
you have to say just little not much
they succeed in making you doubt they
could give a false information about you
and it is really relevant even though
they succeed in placing doubts
for Stan the dice are rolled
when it is physical work it depends on
us you know you have to run you know
that if it isn't going you have to
insist when it is not up to us it is a
little stressful it's true that it is a
little frustrating to think we are
powerless before what might happen we
don't know on what we will be judged we
don't know how it will be done so we are
a little bit stressed
it is the proclamation of results this
morning
the announcement shall be made by the
head of Center Lieutenant Sebastian
Nawa
Aaron
present
Stan starts to realize that names are
being called and to him the failure
Looms
we remain in position
at your disposal
despite his will and physical qualities
the young gavinis will not be part of
the Foreign Legion
saint for Sean the Scottish his name
isn't called out it is time to leave
you have not been selected to join the
ranks of the Foreign Legion
at the call of your name you will
receive pain
you go home
all these men must resign themselves to
giving up their dreams
the consolation of 40 euros pay per day
since their arrival at obangan
for Stan it is a difficult return to
civilian life the young Japanese regains
his identity
is this your passport
yes okay
here you go
Stan won't get a second chance he will
no longer be able to join the Legion
now we move to the bus come with me
Stan had been preparing mentally and
physically for months failure is Harsh
he will never know why he wasn't
selected
definitively unfit my profile doesn't
suit the needs of the Foreign Legion I
sincerely don't know anything more
well I think that they are the experts
they know if they say my profile doesn't
fit it obviously means it doesn't I
didn't come here like a tourist I came
here because I actually wanted to make a
career I wanted to work here
I wanted to have a place in the Foreign
Legion but now that I am told I am
definitively unfit yes I am disappointed
I could never come back never ever
Stan and the others have no chance to
come for another selection in some cases
for example a minor health issue
candidates can represent themselves
again
