phobias are a fascinating part of the
psyche
some are completely understandable and
possibly even
evolutionary as being scared of
dangerous things and creatures
is pretty beneficial for survival but a
question
has eluded psychologists how are phobias
present in some people
but not others and can you condition a
fear
in a human test subject this question
would lead psychologist john b
watson and his assistant graduate
student rosaline
rayner down a very ethically
questionable path
not only was experimenting on a human
controversial but the test subject
would be a nine-month-old baby today
we're looking at the controversial
heartbreaking and morally questionable
baby albert experiments
welcome to the dark side of science
nothing about the statement
experimenting on a nine-month-old baby
sounds good and the idea to deliberately
scare an infant is very off-putting
the experiment is even more
controversial than the monkey mother
studies
as long-term effects could be scarring
for an otherwise healthy human child
as such i'm going to rate the experiment
here eight on my ethical scale
as a subject had no say in becoming part
of the study and to the alleged sourcing
of the child
was not shall we say the most
praiseworthy way
but before we get to baby albert we need
a little background to the person behind
the experiment
john b watson john broadus watson was
born
in travellers rest south carolina on the
9th of
january 1878. he was brought up in a
strict christian family
but things would change in a teenager's
home life when his
alcoholic father left the family this
would cause jon to become
apathetic towards religion the family
later moved to greenville south carolina
where watson would get a chance to meet
people of different backgrounds
igniting his interest into psychology
his secondary education was marred with
run-ins with the law
for fighting and bizarrely discharging a
firearm within city limits
however he was still able to gain a
place at greenville's furman university
at the age of 16. his time at university
was difficult
having to work several jobs he didn't
excel
and did not create many social bonds
which left people to think of him
as lazy and anti-social but he persisted
and at the age of 21 gained a master's
degree he managed to get into chicago
university a couple of years later
and finally his career started to take a
more positive turn
studying under some notable professors
including john dewey
and james roland angel watson began to
develop an interest in behaviouralism
during his time at chicago he read up on
the work of ivan pavlov known for his
classic conditioning
a discipline which would directly
influence watson's later experiments
as a side note this is the same pavlov
with the dribbling dog
i should say that during this time
watson had got married
and was the father of two children but
his marriage would break down
but this will come a bit later on in our
story in 1902
watson gained his phd whilst working as
a research professor
at the university of chicago in 1908
watson accepted a faculty position at
john hopkins university
being promoted to chair of the
psychology department
not long after starting he continued to
study behaviouralism
releasing a paper in 1913 named
psychology as the behaviouralist views
it a manifesto of sorts laying out the
goals of the new discipline
behaviouralism as watson saw it sought
to understand behavior
by only measuring observable behaviors
and events
and that these actions were influenced
from
external stimuli as a consequence of
that
individual's history and learned
behavior from reinforcement
or punishment this new form of
psychological study wasn't initially
accepted by the wider scientific
community
but gradually the new discipline would
make inroads to be a recognized field
the discipline would be expanded upon by
scientists like b.f skinner
aka the guy who made a pigeon guided
bomb
which i made a video about a long time
ago
check it out if you want to see a even
worse produced playing difficult video
in 1915 watson served as the president
of the american psychological
association
watson would continue to produce papers
expanding on his views into behaviourism
which would reject the study of
consciousness with
his important later career 1924 book
behaviouralism but before that we need
to look at a couple of very turbulent
years for watson
which brought about the baby albert
experiment
in 1919 watson released a paper called a
schematic outline of the emotions
during this study he observed a number
of infants which revealed
three fundamental emotions fear rage and
love
each caused by a set of conditions
watson used various animals to observe
the reaction from
the test subjects in most cases
especially when introduced to dogs and
cats
the infant showed a neutral or an
inquisitive reaction
but when introduced to a pigeon flapping
its wings
most subjects showed surprise or even
fear of the motion and sound
to induce fear some of the test subjects
were placed in a dark room
or in a room on their own needless to
say
the children became distressed now these
tests are pretty mild and generally
yielded predictable results
but what if you can get an infant to
fear something
that had initially yielded a neutral
response
for example one of the cuddly animals
from his 1919 study
this will be done by introducing a
neutral stimulus
like a rabbit with a scary stimulus for
example from a loud banging sound
they tried to answer the following
questions that if a fear stimulus
could be transferred to other animals or
other inanimate objects once a fear of
being conditioned
in a test subject they also went to find
out for how long
right this is where the study in my
opinion crosses the line
as a sourcing of the test subject and
finding a parent willing to allow their
child to be given a phobia
would be understandably difficult baby
albert
was a child of a wet nurse at the
harriet lane home
a pediatric facility on the john hopkins
campus
now it's not 100 known how albert was
found
clearly a major contributory factor was
the convenience as harriet lane was
adjacent to the phipps clinic where
watson's infant laboratory was housed
there are three possible ways watson got
hold of albert that have been considered
the first is for a paid study the second
is by using his connections at the
hospital
to coerce and allow access to the infant
and the final
is from doing the experiment without the
mother's knowledge
but we will never know a hundred percent
how albert was found by watson
and we don't even know if that is his
real name
what we do know is that he was selected
due to being healthy
unemotional child who rarely cried the
experiment wasn't just conducted by
watson alone
but also one of his graduate students
rosaline rayner i should say that his
relationship with her
had caused issues with his breaking down
marriage by late 1919. at the start of
1920
and at 8 months and 26 days of age baby
albert was entered into the study
albert was observed reacting to a number
of live animals
for example a rat a dog a rabbit and a
monkey
and various inanimate objects including
human masks
cotton and a burning newspaper
during the initial phase albert showed
no elevated signs of distress
or major reaction to the stimuli what
watson
and rosaline did see was elevated
distress
when a metal bar was hit with a hammer
which created a large amount of noise
sending little albert into a burst of
tears
two months would go by after albert's
baseline observations before the
experimental conditioning would begin
watson and rayner attempted to condition
him to fear one of the items that had
previously garnered a neutral response
a white rat was chosen to be an item to
condition albert's fear
response this was done by presenting the
animal to the infant
and every time he touched it the metal
pole was hit with the hammer creating
the scary noise
it wouldn't take long for albert to
start to fear the cuddly animal
after seven pairings of the rat and the
noise in two sessions
one week apart albert reacted with
crying when the rat was presented
subsequently
with no loud noise although he didn't
seem as distressed when he was allowed
to suck his thumb
which hints at a phobia not actually
being created
a couple of weeks after the conditioning
albert started to fear
other similar items that shared similar
characteristics with the rats
the generalized fear manifested whenever
the family dog
a fur coat some cotton wool and even a
father christmas mask was presented to
the infant
a couple of weeks after that albert's
fear of the rat had died down
including the response to the other
similar items
this prompted watson to recondition the
infant by presenting the rat again with
the loud noise
each reconditioning would only take a
few rounds of the scary noises
but what of the questions set out by the
pair before the experiment
how long does the condition last 31 days
after no exposure to the test items
albert was shown a rat a coat and santa
mask
he again showed a fear response not long
after the final experiment
albert's mother withdrew her child from
the study and left the hospital for good
leaving little trace of what happened to
the test subject this had two downsides
the first was that albert was unable to
be reconditioned to not fear the rat and
the linked fear-producing things
and the other issue was that the study
was incomplete
right well taking into account that the
experiment happened over a hundred years
ago
we do have to look at it in the context
of the time when experimental psychology
was in its infant hood and the study was
even one of the first to be filmed at a
great cost to the university
by today's standards the experiment was
morally ethically and even
scientifically on shaky ground
the first two reasons are pretty obvious
as well experimenting on children is
just wrong
at least in my eyes but the scientific
failures
are very important to consider the study
did not have a control subject
involving only one infant which makes
the data
hard to properly interpret as one result
does not make a conclusion it's almost
impossible to know longer term effects
on baby albert
as we may never know if the phobias if
any created
during the experiment were long lasting
we will never know for sure what
happened to albert
or even if it was his real identity
researchers into the experiment
have a couple of potential identities
with one dying at the age of six
and another living until 2007 but we
will never know for sure
some doubts present as to whether or not
the condition fear response was actually
a phobia
this was due to a reduced response when
the infant was allowed to suck his thumb
which almost made him be able to ignore
the loud sound
the experiment was responsible in part
for destroying watson's working career
but not how you might think what came
out later in 1920
was that the psychologist was having an
affair with his assistant rosalind
rayner
the scandal would result in watson's
dismissal from his job
at john hopkins university the affair
became front-page news during the
divorce proceedings in the baltimore
newspapers
destroying the psychologist's reputation
and with it his university career
not that that was the complete end for
him as he released his behaviouralism
book in 1924
and also psychological care of infant
and child in 1928
he would have another two children and
would work for an advertising company
from late 1920 he would raise both
children
to his and roslyn's behaviourist
principles
and sadly both sons would attempt
suicide with one of them being
successful in 1954.
reyna died on the 18th of june 1935
in norwood hospital in connecticut she
had unexpectedly contracted dysentery
from eating tainted fruit watson would
never remarry
and pass away himself in 1958 at the age
of 80.
