school violence erupted again today
suddenly and with a vengeance columbine
high in littleton colorado
it has been a horror in 1999
two high school students went on a
deadly rampage
and the images seared themselves into
the nation's collective memory
one of the worst school shootings ever
15 dead bodies
still being identified an american
nightmare that too many schools know too
well
yet how much of our explanation for that
nightmare was right
the entire country was confident that
these two killers were two
loner outcasts from the trench coat
mafia
who were targeting jocks in a revenge
fantasy
none of that was true misguided
perceptions of the columbine shooting
continue to influence us today
1999 two students culminated
months of planning by donning black
trench coats and attacking their school
armed with guns and an arsenal of
homemade bombs
they terrorized teachers and peers they
had
a couple of duffel bags at their feet
and we witnessed them pulling out what
we assumed to be paintball guns
that later on turned out to be something
completely different
my secretary comes in and
yells that there had been a report of
gunfire and bombs exploding
so i ran out of my office saw a gunman
coming towards me
i remember hearing gunfire
and i remember glass breaking behind me
i was laying in broken glass from the
the window that had gotten shot out
all i could hear was the the fire alarms
going off
um and then the gunshots at a distance
okay has anybody been injured
okay and the school is in a panic and
i'm in the library i've got
stunned down another table tip heads
under the table
we were all crouched under the tables
and we could hear the
um the the gunshots um getting louder
and
a couple times there was a big boom and
the floor would shake
oh god the gun is right outside the
library
they came into the library eric leaned
under the table and pointed his gun
at me i mean i was like trembling under
there like a little leaf
i saw the shotgun stared at the shotgun
and
all i remember is seemed like the barrel
of the gun was the size of a cannon as
soon as that bullet entered my backpack
and
actually paralyzed me shattering my
vertebrae
that's when the pain set in so there was
like eric um
on my right and then dylan was up on my
left
and i looked up at dylan and i said hey
dylan and he said hey man
and i said what are you doing and
it still like chills me how he was just
like
killing people the killers fatally shot
12 students and a teacher in less than
20 minutes
then they turned the guns on themselves
12 kids died on my watch
along with the teacher in our lives
you're not supposed to bury your kids
and they were all my kids
before the world had fully grasped what
had happened inside the school
there was a scramble to make sense of it
we're getting coverage from four
stations in the denver area
of a shooting at a high school a still
developing situation and one that looks
like it's not going to be over
anytime soon horrors like columbine
terrify us
and we need an explanation so even if we
don't have
an answer we find one and we find it
really too fast
two witnesses that we talked to on the
telephone describe them as members of
the trench coat mafia
these are kids they claim routinely
dress and blatch trench coats
kids were watching this on tv
and also it was the early days of cell
phones if they weren't seeing it their
friends were watching on tv calling them
on their cell phones
um and letting them know they were
saying that um that they wanted to do
this for their revenge
for the school i guess because i mean
they're such an outcast at our school
was this little round and round feedback
chamber so when a kid goes on tv and
says oh yeah they were outcasts
another kid who doesn't really know the
killers well or at all
thinks oh oh they're outcasts oh i
didn't realize that then when he's
interviewed he says they're outcasts so
you're you know you're contaminating the
witness pool
like that and speculation about a
black-coated mafia and its supposed
grievances ran wild
a gang that apparently hated athletes it
was all because
people were mean to him last year the
trench coat mafia
is more than just black clothes these
boys were dangerously strange
in a yearbook photo of some group
members that was broadcast nationwide
neither gunman appeared one member of
the trenchcoat mafia
john savage said there was a good reason
for their absence
eric and dylan were not not at all a
part of
the things that we did as a group they
didn't hang out with us
they weren't trench coat mafia at all
and he says the media's description of
him and his friends
had little basis in fact the trench coat
mafia was like we were
we were video game nerds we weren't we
like you know sit around the table and
you know play dungeons and dragons you
know which is just about
the least dangerous thing you could do
it was a
group of friends that had similar
interests some kids referred to him as
the trench coat mafia but it was not
that it was an organized club
but the explanation about outcast loners
seeking revenge against bullies
had the dual advantage of being both
dramatic and familiar
what happened here at littleton is a
grotesque distortion of high school
fears and rivalries involving cliques
the in groups and out groups
that are a part of teen life in america
author dave cullen spent nearly 10 years
on his account of columbine
researching police records the killer's
diaries and their lives at the school
he said the boys had busy social lives
and didn't seem motivated by bullying
there was lots of bullying at columbine
it was a high school in america
did it have anything to do with driving
these two boys to murder
i cannot find any evidence of that the
killers directed their hostility toward
the whole student population
placing propane bombs set to go off in
the cafeteria at lunchtime
but the devices failed to detonate as
planned columbine actually wasn't a
successful shooting
it was a failed bombing how much more
indiscriminate can you get two big bombs
to kill everyone who happens to be in
that part of the building at the start
of a launch
cullen describes the killer's motives as
a cocktail of malice self-loathing
and a craving for fame over time they
became something like a two-man cult
bent on making their mark on the world
in one final act
it was a murder-suicide for both of them
for eric it was primarily a murder
for dylan it was primarily suicide they
took the tactics of terrorists
and said we can do the same stuff for
our own aggrandizement
eric talked about his audience in his
journal and whether they were going to
understand this
and there was one message observers seem
to take from the event immediately
school shootings have become a dark
stain on american life the phenomenon of
kids turning guns on their schoolmates
is all too familiar
it's not just littleton we know that now
we've had lots and lots and lots of
places
columbine came after a string of school
shootings in oregon
arkansas and other states reaction to
the colorado massacre
helped fuel a national movement towards
school security
parents across the country are demanding
to know what their schools are doing to
keep
their children safe today nearly half of
public schools surveyed nationwide
employ police or hired guards at least
21 states mandate lockdown drills for
school shooting scenarios
and millions of dollars have been spent
on everything from metal detectors
to anti-bullying programs
when people hear as somebody was caught
planting a columbine the world knows
what that means
more than a decade after columbine we're
still struggling to figure out not only
what causes school shootings
but whether or not we're seeing more of
them and coverage of the issue
offers little clarity school shootings
are on the rise in america
i'm telling you i have the numbers to
show it but there's actually very little
consensus on those numbers
experts say that the number is
statistically unchanged since the 1990s
the number of school shootings in
america has been rapidly in decline
over the last decade researchers can't
agree on a methodology for tallying up
attacks
they make different decisions about
whether to include non-fatal attacks on
schools or foiled ones
or even on-campus suicides or gun
accidents
and this leads to vastly different final
numbers
we unfortunately tend to judge how
frequently events occur by how often we
hear about them and that
of course depends on on news reports of
these things happening
the death toll rises in an attack inside
the school cafeteria
in los angeles two students were wounded
in an
accidental shooting a school shooting in
texas leaves two
students injured one statistic with a
more clear-cut definition
is overall homicides in schools the
center for disease control regularly
tracks those numbers
and the trend line is clear while they
vary from year to year
school homicides are essentially flat
across the decades
they're also extremely rare there are
over 300
shootings every day in the united states
how many of those occur in schools
almost none of them
and rare as they are when school
shootings do
happen there's some evidence that past
attacks
and intense media focus on the killers
have helped inspire
future ones that he was inspired by the
columbine killers attack
eight years ago today the gunman adam
lanza was obsessed with the 1999
columbine high school attack and some
news outlets are beginning to take
notice
we are not during this broadcast using
the name of the shooter
often it seems that in history remembers
the names of murderers and not the names
of
victims
it's good that school shootings are
still shocking because it shows that
they're
they're really rare so i think it's
important to
to kind of keep in mind that there are a
lot of schools all over the world
where no one's ever been shot
i could spend my entire life living in
fear wondering
when's the next attack or when's the
next person gonna do that but
that would be it i'd be living in fear i
would be giving in to
what they wanted to happen
you
