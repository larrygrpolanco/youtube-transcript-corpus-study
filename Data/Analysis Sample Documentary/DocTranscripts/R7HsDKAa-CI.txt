ancient tradition
untouched nature
and Urban Development Laos is a country
where these three Worlds Collide in a
very distinct Laotian way
the country is building dams these
enormous works of engineering are what
the Buddhist country is hoping will
allow it to catch up with its wealthier
neighbors
but during a debt crisis can the country
break out of isolation
thank you
the Mekong River is where fishermen
sirhood grew up he knows it inside out
the 25 year old has deployed a bottom
set Gill net
he lives in a small village in Laos
further Upstream a huge hydropower plant
is being built on the Mekong
fishermen are concerned about fish
migration routes spawning grounds and
fishing waters on Asia's most important
Waterway
could you add if the dam is built I
might not be allowed to fish here
anymore this whole section of the river
could be declared a nature reserve
because we are right behind the future
power plant here but my family is
fishing rights only for this section the
fishing times could also change
the Marxist leninist government of Laos
wants to see the country become the
battery of Southeast Asia building
around 100 dams by 2013.
so far 78 have been built one of them is
located on the Namo a tributary of the
Mekong River
the Namo one power plant one of seven on
this River alone was built by China
three years ago at a cost of 2.7 billion
euros
in return the Chinese state-owned
company power China will sell
electricity to the country for the next
29 years after which the power plant
will be taken over by Laos
The Village lutta Hair located directly
behind the dam had to give way for the
plant the only trace the Old Village
Temple by now mostly submerged in the
reservoir
Buddhist monk buncha sotomano is now
worshiping at a newly built Temple
further up the mountain
s
the old Temple was a gift from our
ancestors but the government really had
no choice
I had to do something to make the
population better
the dam brings important foreign
exchange to the country
and
with a donation of about 14 euros per
mural the villagers can bring color to
the new building piece by piece
the painter has been working tirelessly
and the monk seems pleased with the
result
he is content with the change but not
everyone in the village below shares his
stoicism
the state gave every resident the same
compensation when they were resettled
with each household receiving 600 euros
and a 400 square meter plot of land
the farmer sutep sun-dried chilies once
dried on a larger porch
[Music]
house was twice the size of this one
with two floors
the new place is just so small I started
to extend it myself piece by piece but
there's hardly enough space for that
[Music]
with the identical partition plots The
Village has lost its Soul the residents
say and the soil up in the mountain is
no match for the fertile ground by the
river where animals thrived and crops
flourished
the Mekong River is the vital artery of
Laos spanning along its western border
the Communist ruled country as one of
the poorest in Asia seven million people
live here most of whom work in
agriculture
Downstream the quality of the soil is
degrading thanks to the hydropower
plants further up
by slowing the flow of the river itself
the dams limit the supply of valuable
nutrients too
more fertilizer has to be used in the
fields to compensate but fertilizer
prices as soaring says Farm upon
the collapse of the Laos currency the
Kemp can be felt Nationwide
I'm still buying the same things at the
store what can I save on we're doing on
powdered milk for my baby perhaps
I've had to start using up my savings
and borrow money from relatives
Laos 2 is borrowing money from China the
number one investor in the land of the
temples
high amounts of foreign debt are largely
to blame for the currency's decline
the situation only exacerbated by the
covid pandemic
like many places in the capital the vien
Chan shopping mall has seen a huge
decline in Commerce
Miss news Boutique on the second floor
is only just starting to draw customers
again
the rent has doubled rent she pays in
dollars
I heard the government gets inflation
under control soon before the currency
collapsed I could buy 10 pairs of pants
for about 50 euros
now I get five and utilities have gone
up too
at one store however customers are
lining up
train tickets have been sold on the
first floor since late 2021.
China has built a 414 kilometer railroad
line from the Chinese border to laos's
Capital vien Chan
during the day high-speed trains hurtle
through the country
at Night freight trains bring Goods over
the Border
[Music]
the trains speed through dozens of
tunnels and valleys
in the next few years the line will be
extended to Bangkok in Thailand and to
Vietnam's deep sea port
Laos is the only landlocked country in
Southeast Asia so the new rail line
could improve things for many
especially farmers will benefit
according to Alex crema of the World
Bank
well Laos often uses the phrase
moving from Land locked to land linked
and we've looked at the numbers and we
think that that actually is a very
realistic vision for the country we're
already seeing
Farmers particularly in the north of the
country take advantage of the proximity
to very fast growing markets for
agricultural products and in fact this
has really lifted the poverty rate in
the north of the country
we are now arriving at long tap on
Station instead of a treacherous
day-long journey by bus on muddy tracks
the trip from the capital to the world
heritage site luang probang now only
takes a few hours
at the destination a modern train
station the likes of which are usually
seen in China
the new Railway has opened the door for
tourism which brings new opportunities
for the city if you take a walk here in
the morning you might think that time
has stood still
Buddhist monks perform their daily
morning arms round
20 years ago a quarter of laotians lived
below their poverty line today that
number has fallen to just seven percent
but if that number is to continue
improving now is the time for action
the Communist Party of Laos must find a
better way to finance itself than
through additional debt according to the
World Bank
new dams cost money that Laos does not
have and money from hydropower must be
invested properly for example in better
roads and bridges
for a long time there was only a single
bridge over the Mekong to Thailand today
there are four and the fifth will open
in 2024.
at the market in Vientiane the hope is
that prices will sink most of the
products here are imported so faster
delivery would be an advantage
war in Ukraine crane has seen energy
costs explode even here
the rice comes from Laos but has a long
transport route
man so I have to charge twice as much
okay I'll put that one here
onions like these aren't grown here
these ones from Vietnam are bigger and
have gotten much more expensive
those pumpkins come from the south so
they cost around 30 percent more
night falls in the capital and the
streets come to life
Laos is a Young Nation but also a
patient one young people here don't want
to hear about protests despite the high
prices and corruption in the country
there is hope that the end of the
pandemic will bring about change the
hope that for many takes the form of a
hydroelectric power plant
for many laotians green hydropower and
tourism are the light at the end of the
tunnel and the potential is huge
electricity from hydropower alone could
bring the country foreign exchange
earnings of up to 2.6 billion euros
annually
but opposition to too many dams is
growing in neighboring countries studies
warn of the impact on fishing for
example
oh
and more fit fisherman to heard calls it
a day for the time being he is glad that
he can fish at all
a few months ago the gasoline was so
expensive that I couldn't go out at all
that was a real blow our whole village
depends on fishing
[Music]
the catch this afternoon was modest
it's hard to say for sure what will come
of the Mekong it's incredibly diverse
Wildlife or its fisherman when the dams
are completed but for now the river
flows the source of life and livelihood
for some 60 million people
