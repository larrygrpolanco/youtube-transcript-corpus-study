[Music]
most people
think it's a nutty idea
[Music]
no nuclear war is going to happen man's
too smart for that
and if it does be signs it'll mean the
end of everything so there's no need to
worry about
that's the way everybody feels
there's enough nuclear destruction
that if 100 other maybe even a
thousandth
of it were used in the world of
50 000 nuclear weapons
well it wouldn't take many just to
destroy
humanity forever
[Music]
my life has been a completely different
life than most people have
i went into service when i was 17.
[Music]
i spent four years on active duty then
and i was at one of the five bases in
the united states
where secret aircraft were allowed to
land
we were sending these planes off to look
for these
russian bombers that were coming into
our space
and i could see you know the threat
in a different point of view
if you looked at it at that time how
many people thought there might be a
nuclear war
oh it was like 60 70 percent of the
people
60 70 percent of the people today do not
think there will be a nuclear war
but there's 10 or 20 percent
we're very convinced that there will be
i've been working on this concept
of the r2 it's developed over time but
now for 60 years i've been expecting
this
great catastrophe
i started off with four buses
and then i came into a larger amount of
money
i sold the company i had for 50 million
dollars
with the additional money we extended
the shelter
when we quit we were at 42.
the arc ii is completely overkill is the
shelter
it's supposed to withstand a blast mile
and a half outside the crater
you'd almost have to hit it on top
people show up and say you want to trip
through it if you would see it i say
why
i mean just here to
take my time you think boy crazy guy
doing this
generally people just think i'm crazy
i was totally lost in my younger years
trying to figure out what life was about
and i searched like most people don't
i went every area one can look to
try to find the truth
we're created with a purpose everyone
individually
we have free will and we can choose to
follow that purpose or not
[Music]
does this catastrophe occurs
i have this dream that i want to help
the society recover
[Music]
we're doing it for other people
everyone's welcome to come
we live a totally different lifestyle
than anybody else
we don't buy new cars we never go on
trips or vacations
[Music]
kids were just raised with it and
everybody thinks it's crazy
people are looking they say well that's
a strange person
he doesn't have the kind of goals and
all
that we have
[Music]
whatever is put out because it's being
published in
the newspapers or over the tv
that's what you believe
[Music]
i'm just someone with a different
view that they therefore discount
[Music]
everything that i do and everything that
anybody does
it's going to come to naught
[Music]
eventually
[Music]
i've often thought all the time i wasted
doing
this business that thing that project
you know
that's was my path and i followed it
consciously and conscientiously
and i've come to discover
that i dare not change one thing
in the least
you
