You can't deny his offensive output.
He can play.
And we need people that can play.
Who do you wanna talk about first?
None of them.
Billy, we got 38 home runs,
120 RBIs to make up for.
Guys, you're still trying
to replace Giambi.
I told you we can't do it,
and we can't do it.
Now, what we might be able to do
is re-create him.
-Re-create him in the aggregate.
-The what?
Giambi's on-base percentage
was .477.
Damon's on-base, .324.
And Olmedo's was .291.
Add that up and you get....
Do you want me to speak?
When I point at you, yeah.
-1.092.
-Divided by three.
-.364.
-That's what we're looking for.
Three ballplayers-- Three ballplayers
whose average OBP is....
.364.
-Wait, that doesn't come out right.
-It's right, Artie.
-Billy.
-You gotta carry the one.
-Billy.
-Scratch this out.
-Yeah?
-Who's that?
That's Pete.
-Does Pete really need to be here?
-Yes, he does.
Okay, here's who we want.
Number one:
Jason's little brother, Jeremy.
-Oh, God.
-Billy, that's trouble.
Billy, look, if I-- Yeah.
Billy, if I may,
he has had his problems off the field...
...and we know what he can't do
on the field.
He's getting thick around the waist.
There's reports about him on weed,
in strip clubs.
His on-base percentage
is all we're looking at now.
And Jeremy gets on base an awful lot
for a guy who only costs 285,000.
-Jeez, Billy--
-Number two:
-David Justice.
-Oh, no.
-His legs are gone.
-Not a good idea.
-Old Man Justice?
-Why is that?
Steinbrenner's so pissed
at his decline...
...he's willing to eat his contract
to get rid of him.
-Exactly.
-Ten years ago, Justice, big name.
Been in big games.
He's gonna really help
our season tickets early in the year...
...but in the dog days in July, August,
we're lucky if he's gonna hit his weight.
Billy, his legs are gone,
and he's a defensive liability.
I question
whether the bat speed's there.
-His legs are gone.
-Grady.
We'll be lucky to get 60 games
out of him. Why do you like him?
Because he gets on base.
-What is this?
-What are we doing?
Okay, number three:
-Scott Hatteberg.
-Who?
-Hatteberg?
-Exactly.
He sounds like an Oakland A
already.
-Yes, he's had a little problem with--
-Little problem? He can't throw.
He's a career .260 hitter.
The best part of his career is over.
-It's just getting started.
-Boston wants to cut him.
-No one wants to pick him up.
-Good. He's cheap.
Let me get this straight.
You're gonna get a guy...
...that's been released
by half the organizations in baseball...
...because he's got nonrepairable nerve
damage in his elbow and can't throw.
He can't throw and he can't field.
But what can he do?
Oh, boy.
Check your reports
or I'm gonna point at Pete.
-He gets on base.
-He can get on base.
-So he walks a lot.
-He gets on base a lot, Rocco.
Do I care if it's a walk or a hit?
Pete?
-You do not.
-I do not.
I got 37 free agents
that are better than those three guys.
Wait a minute,
let me get this straight.
So you're not gonna bring in one...
...but three defective players
to replace Giambi?
You're not buying into
this Bill James bullshit?
This is the new direction of the A's.
We are card counters
at the blackjack table...
...and we're gonna turn the odds
on the casino.
-I don't see it.
-Seriously, guys.
I think we have to remember
this is the man.
He answers to no one
except ownership and God.
And he doesn't have to answer
to us.
We make suggestions,
he makes decisions.
That's all fine and well, but we've been
working our asses off...
...for weeks to make this club better,
and you're shitting all over it.
This is not a discussion.
-What are we discussing?
-Barry, not a discussion.
Billy, man...
...there's one thing you're forgetting.
None of those three guys
knows how to play first base.
Well, you're gonna have
to teach one of them.
Teach?
Which one?
