Grace and peace in the name of Jesus I
pray this message encourages your faith
my name is Frank Harvey Logan I'm your
brother in Christ and overseer of Faith
open love Ministries in Tampa
Florida in light of the recent BBC
documentary that was produced in
collaboration with the organization open
democracy it is necessary for me to
offer my insights to the body of Christ
given that I was a disciple of prophet
TB Joshua alongside my wife for many
years
is I must first clarify that my
spiritual journey and the establishment
of Faith open love ministries of Frank
hary Logan are divinely ordained
independent of
man although my former discipleship
training with The Synagogue Church of
all Nations has concluded I continue to
hold a profound and respectful bond with
Pastor Evelyn Joshua the current leader
of The Synagogue Church of all
Nations she is a cherished SP spiritual
mother figure to me I hold her her
family and all my brothers and sisters
from the scone in high
esteem I want to
stress that the accusations made in the
documentary stand with the
accusers I pray and encourage
all to seek the spirit of Truth to guide
them in this world for of
deception it is written in Romans
3:4 let God be true but every man a
[Music]
liar allow me to share a story with
you in a small village a father
emphasized the importance of Education
to two of his
sons he was sending them off to a
prestigious
University and he told them that they
could only
succeed if their focus was not
broken so when the two sons came to the
university they encountered a teacher
who was known for his unconventional
teaching
methods the Elder son ignored his
father's
advice he misbehaved he rejected this
teacher's unorthodox
approach and this led to Lost stop
opportunities and
bitterness the youngest son however he
respected his father's guidance and he
stayed focused on his goal embracing the
Unique Style which later contributed to
his personal and academic
[Music]
growth Philippians 4:13 says I can do
all things through Christ who
strengthens
me I want to thank God for the grace to
attend a oneof a kind
University the University of God at
Synagogue Church of all Nations under
the mentorship of prophet T
Joshua glory be to God that my dark past
has become a bright future because my
Focus On Christ was not
broken however not every attendee kept
the
focus
to Briefly summarize my journey at The
Synagogue Church of all
Nations I discovered Prophet TB Joshua
on YouTube in
2010 and it marked a significant turning
point in my life because my faith grew
so
spontaneously that I left all my
possessions everything that I
knew for Lagos Nigeria to stay at The
Synagogue Church of all Nations and
become become a disciple under the
prophet timi Joshua to learn the ways of
the
Lord I called the church my home
immersing myself in this spiritual
Pursuit from November of 2011 until my
departure in November of
2020 tib Joshua explained to us that
some of us need to pass through the
darkness before we can appreciate the
light well I was coming from a past that
was marked by fighting drinking
womanizing and the like that brought me
to the end of my
road the presence of God at the scone
was an embracing light that I appreciate
to this
day Galatians 2:20 says that I have been
crucified with Christ I no longer live
but Christ lives in
me the life I now live in the body I
live by faith in the Son of God Who
Loved Me and gave himself for
me yes my time at the scool was a period
of significant personal
transformation I Crucified My
Swag I Crucified My
slang and I embraced a life of celibacy
from 2011 until the time of my marriage
not to mention my wife who joined
discipleship as a virgin at the age of
16 and she left the virin at the age of
30 just in case you want to know the
kind of life that we were living
in 1 Timothy 68 says if we have food and
clothing we will be content with
that yes to be a disciple of prophet TV
Joshua was not a position of wealth
technically we were volunteer workers we
lived in a church we didn't receive a
salary but we were well taken care of we
were given a weekly allowance to
purchase our breakfast our lunch our
dinner occasionally we were given money
to go and buy the clothes that we needed
or if we traveled to another country for
an assignment we were given more than
enough money to fulfill our
mission we slept in a dormatory we
washed our clothes by hand it was a
total culture shock for me who was
coming from the United
States but it was an experience I
treasure to this day
moreover what I found most
rewarding was witnessing the mighty
power of the hand of God at work
firsthand my eyes cannot say what they
did not
see what my eyes saw during my time at
The Synagogue Church of all Nations was
the authentic Supernatural power of God
in
action the blind see the death hear and
the lame
walk in 1 John 10:21 the people asked
can the demon Open the Eyes of the blind
but now we seem to think
otherwise you see the Miracles were not
brought about by the power or godliness
of any human being but by faith in the
name of Jesus Christ as it says in Acts
3: 11 12 and
16 I will be accountable to my Creator
if I should say that the Miracles at The
Synagogue Church of all nations are
faked we would spend a great deal of
time making sure that people's
testimonies were genuine and that they
had the evidence to back it up I would
be a fool to have left everything that I
owned everything that I knew to follow a
man who was performing fake miracles for
9
[Music]
years but today a generation of
spiritual worshippers are rising up
being driven by the power of the Holy
Ghost it is a testament to the enduring
faith in Christ's
message so people of
God don't let your focus be
broken don't be distracted by the
deception of the
enemy let us win souls for Christ by the
power of his faith hope and love in
Jesus name God bless
you
