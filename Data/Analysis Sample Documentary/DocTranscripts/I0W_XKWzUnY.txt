the sultanate of oman is a country
characterized by breathtaking landscapes
and a thriving culture
this small nation occupies the south
eastern coast of the arabian peninsula
where the persian gulf meets the arabian
sea
oman has used its oil wealth to
modernise whilst honoring its age-old
traditions and thanks to the late sultan
caboose oman has transformed from what
was once a largely underdeveloped
provincial backwater into a modern and
prosperous society
[Music]
nowhere is this more evident than in its
radiant capital muscats
[Music]
a great symbol of sultan caboose's
legacy who sadly passed away in 2020 is
the grand mosque in muscat
the mosque which took six years to build
was a present from sultan caboose to the
people of oman
it's absolutely beautiful here it's a
really really grand mosque and it holds
around 25 000 worshipers and it's made
of around 300 000 tons of indian
sandstone so you can get a sense of how
big this place is
[Music]
religion is at the heart of oman and
omanis mainly practice a moderate branch
of islam called ibidism
the faith underpins many of oman's
values such as tolerance and
open-mindedness which are reflected in
the incredible hospitality of the omani
people
[Music]
the men's prayer room is just as
beautiful as the outside of the mosque
everything from the hand-woven persian
carpet to the crystal studded chandelier
is a symbol of opulence
the mirhab stands tall at the front of
the prayer room signaling the direction
of prayer towards mecca and is adorned
with golden tiled mosaics
some people may be surprised to hear
that the sultan never had any of his own
children but he would often say that
there was no need to because for him the
people of oman were his children
[Music]
matra is a port town in the capital of
moscat and like most port cities it has
a rich history of commerce and trade
i met up with yasser a local omani to
learn more about oman's history and how
it still influences much of the culture
today
we are now in matasuk the one of the old
suga in the middle east
and especially here in oman
and this look here when you enter inside
you just dismiss the frankincense before
the discovery of oil frankincense was
oman's most lucrative trade
the smoldering resin comes from the
boswellia sakura tree and oman is one of
the only places in the world to grow
these
the francis is coming from
the south of uh oman
that's where you find the frankincense
trees that's true
and this is type of the frankincense
with the different
price with the different types
we have like the number ones which is
more
white green see this one
the best quality see the colors that's
like a kind of green white white green
and you can eat it like a chin gum see
you can try
it's me like
it is good for the teeth
and it's good for stomach it tastes like
it's not meat
so when you walk around you can really
smell the frankincense most of the shops
are burning it smells absolutely
incredible
[Music]
the soup sells lots of traditional omani
products and one that i wanted to learn
more about was the kanja knife
the kanja used for hundreds of years as
a weapon is now a defining symbol of
oman
you can see them everywhere around oman
and even on the omani notes
normally wearing this like in the
wedding okay if we meet some
special guest
like we have like a festival or
something
one of the oldest shops in the souk
alibaba also has an incredible
collection of kanjas the owner akhtar
belushi showed me one that was worn by a
member of the royal family and is made
of rhino tusk and gold
it's amazing to see how proud omanis are
of their heritage
[Music]
at the end of mantra harbour is muscat's
lively fish market which is a primary
place locals come to buy their fresh
fish and there is an incredible variety
on offer
the three good quality in oman one they
call king fish kingfish and tuna
and jamun
yeah this is the three famous best
quality effect quality fish
and how do you cook it with spices and
things or how do you cook it like a
traditional tuna you can cook in
different way okay like a curry like
with a sauce like a barbecue
[Music]
fishing has traditionally been the main
source of income for many omanis and to
this day it continues to provide a
living for fishermen in oman's villages
and coastal cities
without the stingray i never actually
thought that you could eat
stingray i never thought that that was
something people could eat in oman we
eat it the test is very good
very
if you try it you want to eat it every
time
[Music]
i'm here at the cornish of muscat which
is a beautiful promenade along the gulf
of oman and it's such a beautiful place
to come and wander along and you can see
a lot of the locals coming out and all
gathering together it's a beautiful
place to come at sunset
you can hear the call to prayer from the
local mosque signaling the final prayer
of the day it's very atmospheric and you
feel like you're truly in the heart of
arabia
[Music]
traditional wooden dow boats which were
historically used for trading can still
be seen on the gulf of oman and are a
powerful reminder of oman's once mighty
empire which stretched along the east
coast of africa and up to pakistan
[Music]
nowadays dow boats are used for tourism
and a sunset boat trip is a perfect way
to see muscat's historic coastline
[Music]
oman fell victim to foreign invaders due
to its prime position on trade routes to
south east asia
in 1507 the portuguese succeeded in
invading and conquering the coastal
region in muscat
they controlled the region for more than
a hundred years before being driven out
by omani forces
the only remaining symbol of the
portuguese occupation are two forts
standing above the city a reminder of
oman's once turbulent past
[Music]
the view of the cornish from the boat is
so beautiful you have the matcha sook
and the mosque and then you've got these
beautiful mountains behind and at this
time as well when the sun's setting
everything just looks so
incredible
[Music]
muscat is a mystical city which is rich
in culture and history i felt like i got
a true taste of authentic arabia
