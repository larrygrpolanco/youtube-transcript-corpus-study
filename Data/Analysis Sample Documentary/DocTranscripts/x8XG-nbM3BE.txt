what's it like in germany
must be terrible well they asked for it
they got it
yes but you can't let them starve i
don't know about that
i got a sun out there as far as i can
see it'd be a good thing if some of them
did die
well a lot of germany is dead
our last bombing was directed against
their communications
against convoys trains road and rail
bridges
against good yards stations fire ducks
we not only smashed up the towns but
smashed up the links between the towns
and at the finish life in germany just
ran down
like a clock place and time meant
nothing
because the people the links between the
people were smashed too
they were just left wandering searching
looking for food looking for their homes
looking for each other
friday
there are 70 million people in germany
and about 30 million of them
are looking for someone or are lost and
lie looking without seeing like the eyes
of a dead rabbit
they are still stunned by what hit them
stunned by the war
they started but in the search for food
and the urge to get home the life force
is beginning to stir again
today our powers of destruction are
terrifying
but the will to live is still stronger
that's why we can't wash our hands of
the germans
because we can't afford to let that new
life flow in any direction it wants
our military government that is your
husbands and sons
have to prod the germans into putting
their house in order
why we have an interest in germany that
is purely selfish
we cannot live next to a disease-ridden
neighbor
and we must prevent not only starvation
and epidemics but
also diseases of the mind new brands of
fascism
from springing up what is more
we have to persuade the germans to do
this themselves
first of all the material patching up
and where in the meantime do they live
so
yes all looks lifeless
but underneath the rubble
there are people living
living in the cellars
the smoke from the cooking stoves drips
up from the ruins to the open third
story where
people are living too
many in the big towns living without
light
without coal without water
without soap living in the stench of
corpses and sewerage
still with the will to live
but the one thing on which all
reconstruction depends
is coal without coal there can be no
power and no transport
in essen our coal control has taken over
the crop family mansion
as its headquarters and from here
we organize the output and distribution
from the whole
ruer coalfields
last summer what was called operation
coal scuttle
brought 30 000 miners back from the
vermont
but today the great problem is moving
the coal from the pit head
to the liberated countries to the german
power plants
and to the allied military dumps
for the germans themselves there is no
coal they must go out in the woods and
parks to cut wood
to strip the bark off the trees to
collect brushwood and carry it home
in handcarts and prams
we say the great problem
but in germany today for military
government officers
there is no such thing as a single
problem
for example the liberated countries
won't get this coal unless there is
transport to carry it
the transport cannot move any distance
unless the tracks and the bridges have
been repaired
they can't be repaired without steel and
the steel cannot be made without coal
there are some 17 newspapers published
in the british zone
they all carry advertisements asking for
the whereabouts of relatives
at hamburg there is a british run postal
search station
indexing inquiries coming in at the rate
of 50 000
a day but when someone contacts their
relatives
they must get a permit before they can
travel by train
hordes of cyclists and pedestrians and
horse-drawn trucks wait
across the pontoon and bailey bridges
built by our engineers
wait to cross after a military
government threat
and all this has to be supervised by our
sergeants
and our peace
foreign
is
is about to leave
so
um
but in all this we have to safeguard
ourselves
first of all from crime and disorder
so military government courts are set up
with british judges
these courts are public there is an
interpreter
a german defense counsel and a british
prosecutor
then the german police force is being
remade
the new german policeman has to
understand that he is the servant of the
public
and not its master
then we have to safeguard ourselves and
disease
the germans are getting 1 000 to 1200
calories a day
according to type of work about half our
rations
but we have a survey team in the field
staffed by the red cross and the ramc
checking the effect of these rations on
the population
tests are made of blood content of blood
pressure
of height and weight and reports sent to
the control commission for them to judge
whether the food is just sufficient to
keep germany at work
but the greatest headache is education
you will never get nazi ideas out of the
heads of some of the adults
particularly those living away from the
devastated areas
what about the children for them the
desolated landscape provides a dream
playground the derelict weapons of war
might have been specially designed to
have games with
there are germans who know this can't go
on
the teachers must be found and
themselves taught to teach the children
that there are other things in life
beyond nazism
and war but again
the complexity of problems
the schools are in ruins the teachers
too few
the children too many and as the months
go by
the children are growing up and getting
more like their fathers
we just cannot afford to leave them to
stew in their own juice
today berlin has still the aspect of a
battlefield
reichstag the seat of past german
governments has been
gutted the crop family
who with the other german industrialists
first backed hitler
and then produced the weapons for world
domination have been scattered
and arrested this family armed germany
in the franco-prussian war
they made big bertha in the first
submarine for the kaiser in world war
one
they are just as responsible for killing
allied soldiers as hitler
and guri and by killing
they grew rich this time
their war plants have been left a mess
of twisted girders
look
this time the vermouth are rarely beaten
to the wire cages all over germany the
master race of men
are slubbering along they are stripped
of their insignia
numbered but this mass of humanity has
to be sorted out into something like
order
not only their bodies but also their
minds
what about the ideas in their heads
they have to be demobilized and got back
to work
but let one man or woman who still
believes in the nazi regime or the
destiny of the german people to rule the
world
take office and you have the beginnings
of another war
so they are put through a screen to
begin with
selected germans interrogate them and
fill in their demobilization papers
note this meek little man who looks like
a clerk or a grocer
here is his portrait in luftwaffe
uniform
then all their thumbprints are taken for
record and they are stripped and
examined for the ss
mark tattooed under the left armpit then
their past history and character is
examined by our intelligence officers
german-speaking ex-commandos and
parachutists
the majority of germans get through this
close examination
and are demobilized but
every so often there appears one who is
suspect
or who is wanted whose papers are too
good
or whose answers are not good enough
rejected back to the cage
as night falls in germany the people
must remember the curfew
those without homes or caught on the
street disappeared into the air raid
shelters
then the air-raid siren wails again to
remind them
that they lost the war of their own
making
to remind them that it is up to them to
regain their self-respect as a nation
and to learn to live in a friendly
manner with their neighbors
to remind them that much as we hate it
we shall stay in germany until we have
real guarantees that the next generation
will grow up a sane
and christian people a germany of light
and life and freedom a germany that
respects truth
and tolerance and justice
now gentlemen you'll raise your right
hands
and take the earth with me
i swear by almighty god
that i will at all times
germany
me
to establish equal justice under the law
for all persons
um
so help me god so why are me a god
helper
you
