hello welcome to the channel this is
your boy aach so just after BBC released
their documentary on TV Joshua I was
kind of looking forward to certain men
of God to come out to speak about this
documentary men of God like youber Angel
L Alas and Shepherd bushiri because this
men of God In Time past have spoken
highly of TB Joshua and defended him
saying that he's indeed a true man of
God no matter what people have said
concerning him and then his ministry now
in this video I just want to share with
you what prophet Loui Alias said um when
this documentary came out and also what
prophet shepher bushiri had to say now
Prophet shepher bushiri actually posted
about you know his response he posted
his response on his Facebook page and
this is what he had to say
now moving on we have Prophet Loui elas
and then he did a full video talking
about this and then he went on to defend
the man of God TB Joshua so without
wasting any time let's get right into
the video and if today is your first
time on the channel kindly
subscribe I'm coming to you live and um
I've been getting a lot of questions um
about the TP Joshua BBC um document
I think it was called surviving the cult
of uh of tib Joshua I want to talk about
that for a second and I pray that you'll
be blessed and that you'll be
enlightened by the mercies and the power
of God that uh the Lord Jesus will be
glorified and the Lord Jesus will be
lifted uh these are very um strange
times we are in and it requires a
strange uh not not strange but um
profound
understanding profound understanding to
be able to navigate these times it
requires profound understanding to
navigate these times and anyone that is
not profound in understanding and in
seeing the Diabolical agenda that is set
up for the
church many of you are going to be
caught up in the Trap that the enemy has
set for you and uh I pray that God will
give you understanding great great great
understanding to understand why some of
these things are happening
now and they did not happen at a certain
time now understand this uh
primarily there is no one without
sin everyone has messed up now me making
this video by no means am I saying that
uh the man of God never had mistakes I
don't know him personally but I love the
man of God and the man of God was used
by God and anyone who says otherwise
it's just you don't know Jesus if you
think that the man was uh was used
demonically or
satanically uh if you truly read
scripture you will know who this man was
now that doesn't mean that he didn't
have mistakes now do I know his mistakes
I I don't know I didn't live with him
but everybody has mistakes the only one
that is perfect is the king of glory the
lord Jesus
now the number one thing that you have
to realize is this the world thrives of
negativity
negative things sell more than anything
that is positive that is the first thing
now you need to ask
yourself what is the
motive of making a video or making a
documentary about a man who can't defend
himself that is the first red flag
anyone that has any kind of
wisdom the primary thing is always to
make sure you don't go with one side of
the
story now when the man was alive I
remember this when the man was alive
there are people who are paid to frame
him on stories if they've paid people to
frame me create stories about me and I'm
nowhere lifted as this man uh was in his
day God is taking me somewhere I haven't
arrived there yet but if they could pay
people to create stories about me if
they could do things to frame
me how much more for a man who took over
a for Christ took over the world for
Christ so the number one thing is you
have to ask yourself I'm not here to
give you uh my opinion I'm here to ask
you questions that you need to question
yourself with the first thing
is why are you going to create something
that a man is not alive to defend
himself why didn't they make this
documentary when he was
alive that is the first
issue
number
two how can we
verify that the people on the on on on
the documentary what they saying is
completely the truth how can that be
verified there is no evidence other than
their words right now maybe he did do
them wrong maybe he didn't do them wrong
Whatever May the case may be but the
question is
this how
can we
verify that what is being said is
true we don't know
that number
[Music]
three why are Christians celebrating
something that the world doesn't believe
in your Jesus the guys who created this
documentary are not
believers they don't believe in the Lord
Jesus they don't believe in church they
don't believe in Salvation they created
this for clicks and for likes right
that's why they made this all
documentary why are you celebrating
something that the world has created
what do you think they are setting the
stage for do you think any of you
pastors are
safe how do you think the persecution of
the church will come and how how do you
think they're going to justify
[Music]
it when they can make a documentary
about a faith they don't believe in to
tarnish you do you think Muslims don't
have controversies do you think Hindus
don't have controversies why is it that
they're only making videos about
Christians you foolish people you can't
see what they're doing they are setting
us up and many of you pastors and and
and evangelists are going to be foolish
enough to to to talk about this and and
tarish somebody and this and that and
that and that you're idiots you don't
get it they setting you up No One Is
Safe
anymore no one is safe
anymore how do you think they're going
to justify persecuting
you how do you think that's going to
happen when they start shutting down
your
churches when they start using another
person let's assume the prophet was
actually an evil man but they start
using him to judge all of us how do you
think you're going to escape that when
they have portrayed an image not to the
church to the world to have an idea of
what Christianity is on mouths of people
we can't truly
verify okay we can't verify any of the
things because it's he say she say I was
I was there's no evidence everybody's
just telling their own
story we can't verify anything and we
don't have the man's witness to defend
himself but but many of you are going to
go online you're going to see your
pastors telling you you see we told you
it was a devil first of all let's go to
scripture let's go theological for a
second let's be theologically sound the
Lord Jesus says this nobody calls Jesus
Lord except by the spirit of God so
anyone that is telling you this man is a
wizard yet the man is casting out demons
in the name of the Lord Jesus the man is
telling you to give your life to Jesus
already we know whoever is judging him
based on saying you a wizard but you can
use the name of Jesus and lead people to
Salvation we know for a fact you don't
even believe the Bible you preach
because now you are arguing with the
words of the Lord
Jesus you are arguing with the words of
the Lord
Jesus I I want you to be sober and think
about this for a
second I want you to think they are
saying that all the Miracles were
arranged
all this were this all this were that
all this were that we can't verify
that but
notice you guys don't understand they're
coming for your church you Christians
you don't get
it if it was done by one of us as
Believers you know one of the one of the
the documentaries I really love and I
watched them years years ago was called
God's
generals
the the the documentary was called God's
generals now in God's General it spoke
about William Branham it spoke about the
Maria Woodward era it spoke about all
these Great Men of God it pointed out
the great they did it pointed out the
mistakes they
made and that is one of the best books
you can ever read to understand the
ministries of the generals that were
there before
us it showed the good that they did and
he showed their errors where they were
in Doctrine where they were wrong where
they missed it for the Next Generation a
to do
better now you tell me when the world is
making a documentary about you notice
all the all the all the shots they used
were spooky shots of tib Joshua making
people fall under the power of God which
is
100% sound nothing wrong with that but
the world won't see it like that because
they don't understand it it's like when
Jesus peit on the ground put mud on
somebody's eyes it doesn't make sense to
the
world we just increased Islam we just
validated Islam which we know is 100%
false you just validated all these other
religions because they cannot attack
Islam because if they attack Islam is
going to be uh discrimination they
cannot attack Buddhism because of
Buddha but they always have always
attacked christianities every time they
make documentary nobody's making the
videos about what is happening in Saudi
or happening in Iraq or Iran or all
these places where where it's controlled
by Muslim no one is going to do that
because the world will not accept accept
it but Christians are a punching bag and
we have made it okay for us to be a
punching
B don't fall for the
Trap even if the man did Evil the good
he did outweighs the
evil and I'm using an
if if the man did
Evil how many families did he feed how
many people got delivered how many
people had the gospel I'm sure the man
had mistakes like every other
person why are we celebrating the
downfall of others what is wrong with
us why are we celebrating the Tanish of
others I'm just telling you to be
wise I wouldn't waste my time watching
that it makes absolutely no sense to me
the world cannot tell me how to look at
Jesus the spirit of God will tell me how
to look at Jesus and how to judge his
servants how to know who is true and who
is not true not out of the mouths of
people that you can't validate anything
or prove anything because the man is not
even there to defend
himself I remember that there's a lady
with crooked eyes on there there's a few
videos of her with Prophet TI
Joshua her taking back a statement
saying who sent her how she was she she
did that a few times you guys don't
don't know it cuz I followed the man's
Ministry back in the so when I saw I
said yo I recognize this
woman be wise
people be wise many of you are falling
for a trap that has been set for the
church if they can if they can do that
to a man that is
dead who can't defend himself you think
you're safe you think Christianity is
safe you don't understand what is coming
but I pray that God will give you the
wisdom and the
understanding that you will escape the
snare and the trap the enemy has set for
the
church that we will escape
it this was made with people who had a
bias and they only put people who had
biases they didn't put people on the
other side because of what they wanted
to portray and it's good regardless of
it it will not erase anything this man
did it cannot it will never erase it it
cannot undo it whatever God's hand is on
you you can turn it on yeah whatever
God's hand is on no one can do anything
about it it is
established so I pray that the Lord
Jesus will bless you that you will have
the wisdom needed to na at this wicked
world we are living
in I believe in Prophet Joshua's
Ministry I will always believe in it
because I know the Lord Jesus walked
with this man and if he had
mistakes it reveals the grace and the
power of God even more nobody calls
Jesus Lord except by the spirit of
[Music]
God the devil does not cast out Satan or
should I say Satan doesn't cast out
Satan
always remember that so when they come
and tell you he's using demonic power
and he's saying in the name of Jesus
come
out anyone who tells you otherwise just
ask them do you really read the Bible do
you believe the Lord Jesus if they
believe the Lord Jesus and they can make
a statement like that just know they
don't actually believe the Bible they
believe what they believe they believe
in their own theology not the word of
God and you'll notice it's people who
are powerless that talk like that or
speak like that no people who have
actually been endowed with The Graces of
God true genuine Grace
so I pray for grace for you and
um that's what I got so many emails I
got so many DMS people asking me about
this so I thought it was good for me to
speak on it I love Prophet TI Joshua and
I am praying for synagogue the church uh
that the Lord will truly truly fight for
it and that the legacy of his servant
will not go down if by this standard is
what we are judging then you guys should
stop reading David stop reading about
David David was a matter
too stop reading about Moses stop
reading about all these people stop
reading about Solomon close your
Bibles I don't see anybody making an
exposure video of
David Wise up become wiser may God bless
you and keep you
[Music]
