right here
[Music]
it's morning it's another day as usual
every early The Men start hunting plants
for the day stuff
what I like in this community is the
communication they have
they follow the instructions of their
leader now we are going to hunting
[Music]
but before everything they make sure
their dog has eaten and is full
when the dog is full it makes them
easier in hunting
[Music]
they breed many dogs because the dogs
have been a great help in hunting
[Music]
the hunting work began and it did not
take time we succeeded in finding the
animal as usual hunters start by eating
meat as a sign of congratulations for
their work
foreign
they started by skinning the animal and
skinning it
While others prepare the fire so that we
can roast the meat
um
in life when you succeed in something
you must be happy
they are happy for successfully getting
meat
