ADHD is a very complicated thing and
there is no one true way to experience
it
on paper it's a chemical imbalance in
the brain that causes issues with
executive function memory organization
Focus ADHD is a very hard thing to
describe especially to those without it
because every explanation just sounds
like another excuse I just can't do it
isn't enough even though oftentimes it
is the reason
ADHD is living a life knowing what the
full picture is supposed to be but every
time it matters you find yourself
missing a piece
you're sitting in a classroom the
teacher is up front going into detail
about a new assignment you're confused
and everyone around you seems to be
paying attention and you know that if
you just did the same you wouldn't be
confused but there's something about the
room or the teacher or yourself that's
getting in the way maybe it's just the
way he's phrasing things you think so
you turn to your friend and you say hey
I don't get this are you able to help me
and as your friend they say of course
along with four words you'll be thinking
about for a long time
what don't you understand
you're in your room trying to read the
assignment for yourself but your
thoughts wash it out
if you're reading a sentence and you're
reading a sentence and you're reading a
sentence and you're reading a sentence
and you're reading a sentence and you're
reading a sentence and you're reading a
sentence
you should turn off the fan
and pour yourself a glass of water or
get something to eat
you've really been meaning to stay more
hydrated but you keep losing track of
time I'm thirsty or I'm hungry becomes
I've almost finished this task I'll get
it when I'm done it becomes I've been
sitting here for hours tied to my spot
by the air and my own nerves and I'm
feeling light-headed
to be safe you pour yourself another
glass of water hopefully now you'll be
able to focus
you walk back to your room and realize
the sun has set
you've wasted the day
sticky notes have been known to help you
keep track of what you need to do so you
write a note for yourself and you go to
bed you know it would be better to
prepare for tomorrow tonight but it'll
be fine you've got your alarm set you'll
wake up with plenty of time
you miss your alarms you missed your
chance to pack have breakfast brush your
teeth you're missing your keys and in
the rush to find them you think of all
the times you've been here before if
only you could just learn your lesson
your mum's waiting for you by the door
it's been two days is it really that
important yes it was in the bag but it's
gone missing do you really have to find
it now just leave it we're gonna be
classes started people are staring you
try not to stare back it's rude
nice of you to join us the teacher says
this is the time this month
he continues with the lesson you try
your hardest to focus and pay attention
and take in what he's saying just listen
it's not hard just listen and everything
will be so much easier what is he even
saying oh God this always happens can I
please just listen
you're on the train home you look at the
next stop screen reciting each station
in your head how many times have you
been here how many times have you done
this
you've made it home you're exhausted you
don't know why you didn't even get
anything done today it would make sense
being destroyed if you've gotten
something done but your brain is fried
without the results to justify it
and that's when you realize you forgot
to ask about the assignment whatever
you'll just ask him tomorrow
and why didn't you tell me sooner well I
was meant to but it slipped my mind for
two weeks
it's been two weeks
yes
it's been two weeks
right well um
uh actually what have you been doing in
class the past few weeks what have you
been doing
nothing absolutely nothing but you can't
tell him that that'll never be enough so
you find yourself making something up
that convinces no one but what else can
you do
two weeks two valuable weeks gone wasted
it's due by the end of the week and you
have nothing absolutely nothing to work
with no notes no Foundation you're
running out of time you're running out
of time you're running out of time
you're running out of time you're
running out of time you're running out
of time you're running out of time
you're running out of time
you look at the sticky notes on your
wall they're good at keeping track of
what you've failed to do with what you
haven't even tried to do all the
promises you've made to friends teachers
and yourself that you've broken in time
it's not like you want to let people
down you wish you could do the opposite
sounds like it should be so easy but no
matter what you do you find yourself
somewhere else entirely
it's at this point that they may have
thought of this assignment sends you
into a spiral of Despair are you just
doomed to be like this forever with life
of constant noise and distraction and
disappointment you start to wonder how
long you'll end up stretching this
project out until you can finally get it
done
all hope seems lost you're alone and
exhausted and finally a bottle a small
white bottle
Dex amphetamine the doctor said five
milligrams twice a day it's the only
thing you haven't tried so you try it
and it's like putting on a pair of
glasses after a lifetime of not knowing
just how blind you really were
it helps
good
