Hello, citizens of AutoDale, and welcome to tonight's PSA.
What is a model citizen?
"Well, I'm home."
"How was work today, honey?"
"It was a delight."
Well, families of AutoDale,
a model citizen is a providing father.
A model citizen is a caring mother.
All in service of a scrappy young boy or girl.
A model child, raised by a model family to become a model citizen of their own.
For AutoDale is hardly automatic.
You and your families are the gears that keep our engines turning and turning.
And let us hope that this perfect cycle never ends.
"Joe!"
Greetings, Mr. And Mrs. Robinson.
Daily check. How are we doing tonight?
"Well, work was a delight."
"Oh, dinner was just wonderful."
"And Junior's just been tucked in."
Splendid! Taking after his father, I hope.
Seems everything's in order.
"Leaving so soon?"
"You wouldn't care to join my lovely lady for a dance, would you, Joe?"
One day, Mrs. Robinson. Not today.
"Aw."
"You disappointed the lady, Joe."
Deepest apologies, Robinson family, but duty calls.
It would seem the cycle never ends.
And when the time comes...
...when your model child is grown up and is ready to start a model family of their own,
a true model citizen knows that their duties are finished and their course has run.
"I think it's time."
"I was... kind of hoping that the cycle would never end."
[thunder claps]
"I'm so proud of him."
"We did good."
You did indeed, Robinsons.
True...
...Model Citizens.
"Thank you, Joe."
Deepest apologies, Robinsons. Duty calls.
I'm afraid Autodale is hardly automatic.
...and your families are what keep our engines turning and turning.
Let us hope that this perfect cycle never ends.
