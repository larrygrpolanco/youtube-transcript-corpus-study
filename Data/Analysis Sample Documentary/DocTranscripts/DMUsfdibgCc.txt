take his family out of poverty gone
[Music]
his country is playing in half between
lasting violence in the streets and this
is happening around neighborhoods brutal
police intervention that's five or six
people per day killed by the police and
the rise of a military regime the
government launched operations imposing
military law full on warfare this is the
story of a man who grew up in Islam

defeat over and over again this is the

by his bed I woke up at five in the
morning to work and then went back to
the hospital sometimes I went one month
without going home just going from the
hospital to work and back
when Charles is finally released from
the hospital his mother fears for the
worst videos
Charles family lives in one of Sao Polo
slums known as favelas
ten times more African slaves were sent
to Brazil than the
SE when slavery was abolished people
regrouped in unregulated areas around
the country essentially building cities
within the cities all this electricity
is actually hijacked from the main
system it's estimated that there are
more than 1 000 slums like this in Rio

to this day the people when the favelas
are still left to themselves
so of course that's a fertile ground for

s his mother to let him bring him to a
jiu jitsu practice
and Charles is able to practice Jujitsu
without any pain
[Music]
so every single day Paulo starts
bringing Charles to jiu jitsu practice
he said that one day we would be
Champions and that we would give joy to
my parents only one month after getting
started Charles wins his first
tournaments
[Music]
it can also take
foreign
he'll never get to see Charles career
flourish it's tragic but it's also a
quite common occurrence in the favelas
you know how many homicides have you
been called four or five
just today
it's eight o'clock in the morning lots
of machine guns AK-47 AR-15 762 or 90
millimeters room after room filled with
uh with weapons and ammunition like this
the side raid in Brazil is six times
higher than in the U.S more than 63 000
people were murdered in Brazil in 2017.
to counter the crime in the favelas the
government forms police specification
units the pacification program resembles
nothing less than a full-blown military
operation essentially aiming to reclaim
those territories from gangs and Drug
leaders all of a sudden the police can
come open a fire and we have to go to
one of these houses to hide ourselves
fighting fire with fire
police here aren't just trained to hit
their target they're encouraged to kill
them
selves
there are three times more people killed
per year in the city of Rio only than in
the entire United States
forced to go on without his uncle Paulo
Charles transitions to mixed martial
arts

Charles does find success entering the
UFC but he quickly finds out that his
father's words were true he starts
losing
foreign
a common pattern you find in UFC
fighters on a losing streak is going
down the weight class on an average day
Charles Oliveira weighs 180 pounds he
competes in the UFC in the lightweight
division that's 155 pounds after he gets
knocked out by Cowboys surrounding
Charles makes the decision to go down to
the featherweight division at 145 pounds
that's a 35 pounds weight
since most of that weight comes off in
water during fight week the perfect
method and timing is required to have
the right weight at the right time
Charles misses wait four times and even
Falls ill in 2014 due to a bad weight
cut as a featherweight he builds a
record of seven wins and five losses one
of those leaving him paralyzed you'll be
sick
and things at home are getting even
worse as the 2016 Olympics are
approaching the government starts
cleaning out the favelas
they relocate the people outside of the
city the operations often leading to
conflict the tactics of the pacification
police are increasingly being questioned
in the U.S one in 37 000 arrests lead to
death in Brazil That's 1 in 23.

the cross line would you like to see him
