Grace and peace to you all in Jesus's
mighty
name after much prayer and reflection I
want to share with you all a short
statement in relation to the documentary
on BBC
regarding my mentor Prophet TB
Joshua remember first that salvation is
personal as the scripture says in
Revelation
3:20 Philippians 2:12 and John
3:16 as a disciple of prophet tib Joshua
for 17
years from
2004 to his passing in
2021 I want to emphasize that my
personal experience es do not correlate
with any of the allegations in this
documentary I personally witnessed both
the fruits of the Holy Spirits in
Galatians 5:22-23
and the gifts of the Holy Spirits 1
Corinthians 12:
7-1 in the life of of prophet TB Joshua
and I saw the the name of Jesus Christ
consistently glorified and the truth of
God's word consistently
preached now I have a word of advice for
believers as
Christians we must be careful not to
shift our Attention our Focus from the
spiritual to the Natural and get
distracted from the Great
Commission please see Mark 16 from: 15
to 18 Galatians
3:3 and 1 Corinthians 2
verse4 Disciples of Jesus Christ must
remain focused
on doing what God has called us to
do
preaching the Good
News to a troubled
World remember what Hebrews chapter 13
ver8
says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
today and forever his power to heal the
sick has not changed his power power to
deliver the oppressed has not changed
his power to restore broken
hearts has not
changed his power to save the Lost has
not changed and faith in his mighty name
still works wonders
today acts
3:16 Phil Philippians chap
2:
9-
11 let us
continue to fix our eyes on Jesus Christ
the author and the finisher of our faith
as Hebrews 12:1 says and let us continue
to love
everyone and Trust only
God God bless you all and
remember it is all about Jesus
