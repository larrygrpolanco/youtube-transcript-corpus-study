thank Google look here guys
[Music]
actually I'm not sure if I should
explore this maybe when I'm more
prepared though it doesn't look like it
eats anywhere no maybe this is a good
place to the third base looks really
cool here I actually might do that
[Music]
there we go look how cute this this
dissing has read big head okay but we
got distracted
let's maybe climb that tree over here
okay that's fire right there
take holy crap
that's more
okay Gold I should have been able to see
this from my base look you can even see
the pyramid
I'll keep this block Japan doesn't seem
to be anything directly under the block
oh look at this
we actually found something not just a
matter of getting down water if this is
just a regular cake system
[Music]
so let's head back to the gate I'm going
to replace the gold books with this one
let's remember displayed guys in case we
have the one guns back
ok show what gold box should I replace
the one with dad or just a random one
Oh
CREB
[Music]
I did not put this here
ah you can empty fine Oh unleash
[Music]
Unleashed to unleash means to cause a
strong or violent force to be released
or become unrestrained
let's see I think the base should be on
this flat area right here just food back
because I don't want to lose it
