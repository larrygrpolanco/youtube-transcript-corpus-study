there are tens of thousands of children
now living
under the control of isis in iraq and
syria
children the group is now actively
recruiting as their next generation
of fighters ten-year-old hamud

getting independent information about
isis military training of children
isn't easy thousands of syrian refugees
now live in turkish border towns
most people are afraid to talk because
they fear isis sympathisers
are here too but some children were
willing to speak out
on condition of anonymity
this 14 year old boy says he joined isis
after they convinced him they were pure
muslims
but when they threatened to kill his
brother he says he lost faith in isis
and fled isis propaganda videos
show children being put through rigorous
physical training
but boys who've undergone isis training
say they are
also being taught something much more
dangerous
isis calls these children cubs of the
caliphate
the boy says from what he saw children
are being systematically recruited
across
isis-controlled territory into the three
different
isis fighting units
this is video shows a stage of basic
training for children
where they're coerced to commit violence
all of this seemingly unaffected by
hundreds of coalition airstrikes
it's physically hard but the main aim is
to create a new
army of unquestioning and what isis
deems
ideologically pure fighters
it's that loyalty that isis is
exploiting for another horrifying
purpose
it starts with showing the children
videos
of suicide attacks
and how how young would be the youngest
boy that wants to be a suicide bomber
that you saw

convincing young children to sacrifice
their lives without question
requires intensive indoctrination
we track down an insider who says she
was in charge of that process
until just a few weeks before we met
this woman she says
she was an isis teacher who prepared
girls
as young as 10 for suicide attacks

these boys have also recently escaped
isis-controlled
syria now in turkey they attend
weekly de-radicalization classes to
counter the influence of isis
indoctrination

children are taught to spy on their
parents who risk
death if they object to their children
joining isis
boys are routinely gathered in town
squares
where they're offered money and food to
join isis
and fed anti-western tirades
this ten-year-old boy was among those
isis tried to recruit
the boys say they are sat in front of
big screens and forced to watch videos
of isis brutality
propaganda videos like this which shows
the recent execution of
syrian soldiers in palmyra
[Music]
they say they're forced to watch real
executions too
but perhaps most disturbingly of all
isis releases videos
showing executions being carried out by
boys themselves
like this boy who is shown beheading a
syrian officer
or this boy who apparently executed two
alleged russian spies in january
[Music]
boys are told they too will be killed if
they don't join
isis by age 16.
but death is not the only punishment for
refusing to join

amputation

he says
severed his limbs

omar's amputations were carried out just
three weeks before we met him
he had escaped syria only days before
the price of his defiance is constant
pain

the children of this new isis army are

their ultimate purpose
is to also launch attacks on the west
