[Music]
louis if you win on sunday it will be
your record-breaking eighth title max if
you win it will be your first
[Music]
max has definitely been always on it
always on the top of his form where
lewis seems to be a little bit tired at
times uh the the saving grace for uh
mercedes and lewis is they don't pay a
high price for mistakes
you cannot forget that lyrics
had that opportunity to beat michael
or he's already the top of the top maybe
the top of the top of the top and i
think that's very important for him
to win this championship but max
he's trying everything he can i think
the first
title is something that uh
is the most important one because the
first i mean is just
put your name on the on the on the page
a lot has been made about how the
championship may or may not be won this
weekend do you have any concerns that it
may not be won fairly honestly i just
don't give it any energy i'm here to do
the best job i can with this incredible
team we never thought that we would be
neck and neck going into the last race
naturally the media
starts to say these things you know so
yeah i don't really have a lot
more to comment on that i think i
arrived here
just trying to do the best i can trying
to be the best prepared and and of
course actually trying to to win this
weekend i'm here to do my job and i
don't want to see the stewards
any more that they want to see me
second row for him max verstappen
crosses the line he's on pole
oh yes
didn't expect that one but amazing jump
guys
[Applause]
we've pushed the limits we've pushed
each other we've pushed our competitors
and i think you know here we are at the
final race for the showdown it's all in
for this sunday and whoever wins
deserves to win
the eyes of the world look to the
conclusion to hamilton versus verstappen
in 2021 two of the greatest drivers this
sport has ever seen are ready to put it
all on the line for the ultimate prize
in motorsport
all eyes now focused on the grid the
talking eventually has to stop the
wheels start to rotate and then it is
game on
[Music]
it's lights out away we go and hamilton
gets a decent start and he's already
ahead of max verstappen
hamilton leads into the first corner
this three of breasts going into the
turn nine headband oh near
and lewis hamilton almost coming
together hamilton has to go off the
track the dutch fans roaring in the
background yes he gets that back
back
yeah we're happy with the gap that
you've reinstated well we'll wait to
hear from michael massey all eyes on the
message board here in our commentary box
and what about the stewards are they
going to get involved 58 laps to run and
already on the first lap the two
championship rivals collide no
investigation necessary say the stewards
an investigation on the shortcuts all
the advantages that he's gained in terms
of caps
that is incredible
what are they doing here
go ahead jonathan so max is ahead of the
apex jonathan's on the track jonathan
he's forced him out there that's why we
asked him to give back lewis has he left
the track and i told him to get back on
the advantage all the advantage was
already given back prior to the first
lap ending
so the regulations say a 401 car must
not be any wider than two meters
and why do you think sergio perez can
make that red bull at the moment then
this could be checkmate for lewis
hamilton who's trying to get past the
honda power driver how tight is he going
to push it as tight as he can but he's
gone to the inside will perez throw it
back he will hammer to be aware yes he
is and look at this defensive tactics
this time he stays on the racetrack
hamilton gets the power down and
hamilton gets the race lead back perez
tried to hold him off but it's not been
by enough hamilton saw it coming and
he's gone to perez
inside and hamilton has to give it back
the problem that sergio perez is causing
hamilton is enormous here
perez paying back the team for all of
the faith that they showed him to give
him another he's basically not driving
off the corner here
this is extraordinary this is kicking
off ladies and gentlemen this is really
really big time because they're furious
with the move on the first lap like it's
a bit dangerous can you want
perez and hamilton in the 134s and the
133s the gap now coming down between
verstappen and hamilton you can see him
right in the background hamilton needs
to get past perez here he does get past
perez he moves towards the inside he's
going to force perez the long way round
if perez is going to try and retake that
lead of the race but on lap 21 hamilton
does get past perez but perez has played
the ultimate team game and he's really
brought his teammate back into play and
he can give his teammate a bit of trs
for good measure so great team play
that's the team play we talked about
earlier on now he gets clean out of the
way oh checkers
absolute animal
red bull are looking for something
beyond their control to try and help
bring them back into this race lewis
hamilton on course to become champion
you know the pace of the mercedes is
just too strong today so with yeah
but uh we're gonna need a miracle in
these last uh ten laps to turn it around
so uh he'll give it everything but
you know the clock's ticking
copy
[Music]
oh no nicholas latifi has crashed that
will be a safety car that's a safety car
because they'll not be able to recover
that and we've got a completely
different situation
so have a double yellow turn 14 entering
it now stay left stay left staying out
staying out
will we get any more racing laps or not
what jeopardy at the end of this grand
prix the end of this world championship
that's there's a yellow flags at 10 14.
latifa is completely in the middle of
the road debris all over the shop
so strap mode one strap
negative
coming into the pits max verstappen
hamilton stays out verstappen coming
into the pits
hamilton's a long way clear on the track
but i rather get the feeling by the time
he comes around to the main straight
he's not going to be able to pit and
stay ahead of max verstappen oh man you
love good meaning
there's four laps including this one
uh these back markers should get out of
the way they should unlock themselves
yeah they will once that message comes
through
what's the situation behind so situation
is that the staffing has pitted he had a
free pit stop we've lost track position
to him four laps remaining or when you
cross the line it may not restart is he
right behind me
he will be
once they've sorted out all the order
this is going to take a while to sort
out
with new tyres
and copy lewis we would have lost track
position if we had pitted
and lapped cars will not be allowed to
overtake which leaves verstappen with a
lot of work to do then
okay so stay online max those lap cars
are now being allowed to overtake stay
online let them go off the racing line
i'm not sorry cancel that black cars
will not be allowed to overtake
yeah of course difficult decision
it's classic
oh that's the price
mr michael yes go ahead christian yeah
why why are we getting these cars out of
the way and just give me because
christian just give me a second
okay my big one is to get this uh
incident clear
you only need one racing lap
that cars may well
will now overtake what is going on so
norris and alonzo and okon and leclair
and fettel
wow
i think all the cars ahead of you are
going to pass hamilton
everybody behind you will stay in
position
the safety car is in this lap max
that was so not right
this is unbelievable this is incredible
if you've never watched formula one
before if this is the day that you're
watching it's never normally like this
max verstappen is almost overtaking
lewis hamilton this is barely believable
this is it
this is it
we're gonna have one lap of racing to
decide the championship hamilton has the
advantage verstappen has the faster
fresher tyres and we've got
3.2 miles of racing action all the way
to the checkered flag
is it gonna be a first world
championship for verstappen is it gonna
be an eighth world championship for
lewis hamilton where can verstappen try
and get past hamilton first overtaking
zone it's normally down in the turn five
it's verstappen firing up back he's
gonna make
the championship trophy from lewis
hamilton who's trying to fight back
no drs for two laps so lewis hammer will
not get the rear wing open now he's
gonna go down the outside
if the stabbing keeps it tight and neat
but he hasn't he's got a little bit
worse
here comes lewis hamilton though down
the back straight he's got a slipstream
he almost touches verstappen they almost
make contact into turn nine verstappen
stays ahead of lewis hamilton of all the
drama of all the controversy of all the
magic moments in formula one in 2021 it
comes down to this and at this moment it
looks like it's gonna go the way of max
verstappen mercedes not happy red bull
will be delighted they have shared a
brilliant championship battle but the
championship could only be one by one
and it's going dutch in 2021 max
verstappen for the first time ever is
champion of the world
oh
you are the world champion the world
champion we are so proud of you
i've just speechless absolutely
speechless
you need to reinstate the lab before
that's not right
toto yes it's called a motor race okay
sorry we went to car racing
[Music]

[Applause]
[Music]
max verstappen you are a formula one
world champion
[Applause]
it's unbelievable i mean
well to my team i i think they know i
love them and i hope we can do this for
10 15 years together
there's no reason to change ever
[Applause]
[Music]
a big congratulations to max and to his
team um i think we did an amazing job
this whole year it's been the most
difficult of seasons and um this last
part of the season we gave it absolutely
everything and we never gave up and
that's the most important thing yeah
we'll see about next year
it just means a lot i mean it's my life
you know once you achieve your life goal
your life mission it's just something
truly incredible but also not only for
me but for my whole family because they
also had to live for me because my dad
was away a lot
it probably cost a marriage
and also my sister you know she missed
me she missed her dad
because my dad was always with me so all
of this now you know this hasn't been
for nothing
and that's something i which is very
special
