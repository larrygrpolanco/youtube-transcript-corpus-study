I've not seen her in ages
[Music]

you deaf cow why have you bought all
this expensive junk
I have to give you less money next time
can't do anything right can you

your mother's dressed like a clown you
shouldn't see it
it's classic Liz
the only things are missing is a red
nose
well it's dark kind of crusty from now

hello
[Music]
a message your dad told him we can't
make his birthday
can't be bothered with all your gang
ignoring me
[Music]

[Music]
it's just us
get these cobwebs cleaned up
wake up you lazy Pig
[Music]
looks ridiculous shut up
think about it before you say anything
why'd you make me do these things
you're not going anywhere
you're staying here
you're staying here you're staying here
[Music]
that was me stuck in a cycle of abuse
day after day walking on eggshells in my
own home I reached out I got the support
I needed to leave him and you can too
