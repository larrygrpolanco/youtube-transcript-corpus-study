to eight years now it's been constant 24
hours of the day every day for at least
six to seven years apparently and it
means that every day residents of Port
Harcourt are have no option but to be
inhaling this black suit on a daily
basis new bonds
children under five
adults men women elderly everybody is
made a smoker because of the exposure to
the black suit the carbon is one of the
chief constituents of the suit the size
is so small is less than 2.5 micrometers
that simply means you cannot see it with
the naked eye except with the aid of an
electron microscope in 2018
fenimaka it made a pediatrician carried
out a retrospective study where she
found out that majority of children have
come down with upper respiratory tract
infections in Port Harcourt there's been
an increase in the prevalence of death
defects amongst women that delivered in
University of Port Harcourt teaching
Hospital in the last five years majority
of the male residents in Port Harcourt
have structural abnormalities of their
sperm cells that is simply to put they
cannot impregnate their wives so people
in Port Harcourt by the day are becoming
more infertile all right because of the
suit that we inhale every day that is
how bad the situation is in Port
Harcourt unfortunately not enough
um measures have been taken to reduce or
stop because of the suit whenever the
time for the stoppage of the deadline
for the stoppage of gas flying by
national Oil Company riches the federal
government keeps on extending the
deadline for the federal government is
just a way of making money saying
Revenue generation and strategy for the
government rather than protecting the
life and property of the citizens of

I'm a graduate too and I I praise myself

double children for me
once upon a time before say October 9th
there was a food bridge where people
used to go about their daily activity
and businesses but precisely night of
October got collapse got washed away by
the flood and the big grasses not just
the wooden bridge every other part is
messed up you know it's matched up
inside the offices the bar The Guest
House Everywhere is gone down so
business has been really difficult for
us but yes we need to move on the same
one go and get stopped the top gets
going so we're left with no other means
to go about in our activity and then
people were stranded so we have to
create an alternative means for them to
go about the activities by introducing
the boats instead of those smaller
wooden candles because those ones are
not safe you know so with this now
people are happy and they are still
going about their activity meaning that
we are still in business but not as as
it seems to be business as been bad a
little bit yeah because it's not
everybody that's comfortable using the
boat the people that normally give us
those little tokens they packed away
because of as a result of the flood
so in that way it affects me very well
but I'm only happy that the two one that
remains they are able to cope up for the
situation of the flood really we are not
making water it definitely will make
money
