on april 4th of this year my black lab
bailey had nine pups
though my channel's usually just
building stuff
i thought i'd try something new and film
the whole journey of these pups growing
up into 10 week old dogs before they're
rehomed
[Music]
[Music]
a couple days old the pups still rely on
mum for everything and that includes
eating cleaning and even just their
general sense of direction
for her it's a 24 hour a day job and for
the first couple days she even eats and
drinks right in the pen
which in our case is a kid's pool in the
garage because i'm not a dog breeder
[Music]
for the first couple weeks the pups
experienced their whole life through
just touch and smell
but soon enough their eyes will be open
and they'll be reacting to sound
[Music]
[Music]
by day five they're already a little
more self-sufficient and mom can take
longer trips away
but her bathroom breaks are still as
fast as possible
and she eats up the puppy food about as
fast as it hits the bowl
after all she's eating for 10.
[Music]
okay
[Music]
but after a couple cries from our pups
it's right back to work
[Music]
ten days in and all that eating's really
paying off they're about three times the
size of when they were born already
[Music]
the rides are still closed but they
should be open in the next couple days
and they're already starting to react to
sounds
they can also walk pretty good on their
own now
[Music]
today was also the first day i noticed
that their tails are actually starting
to wag like little dogs
[Music]
by day 15 their eyes are just starting
to crack open and mom's a lot more hands
off now
she still feeds them about six times a
day but other than that she's pretty
much free to roam around a lot
[Music]
they're starting to get pretty mobile
and pretty soon they're going to outgrow
this little kiddie pool
[Music]
they can hear every time i come into the
room now and they all start moving
around
but after a couple minutes it's time for
another nap
[Music]
at the three week mark they're
definitely starting to outgrow this
little pool so it's time to take them
inside while i build something that'll
work for another couple weeks before we
move them outside
[Music]
get them
[Music]
now they're starting to get pretty
playful and they have a little more room
to move around in their new pen
[Music]
they also like to poop a lot this pen
needs cleaned out almost every day
[Music]
they're also very aware of all their
surroundings now and pretty curious of
anything new like a camera in their home
[Music]
and for the first time they're trying
something other than milk
[Music]
and those tiny new teeth coming in sure
calls for a lot of biting
[Music]
you guard the pups
[Music]
now
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
now it wouldn't be a drew build stuff
video if drew didn't build stuff so now
i'm gonna whip up a new pen for these
dogs and they can move outside now that
the weather's a little warmer
[Music]
come on
[Music]
in week five the pups are now starting
to eat some canned wet food and a little
more pressure is taken off them all
even though we set it out for them in
three or four bowls they're always a
frenzy of one bowl while other ones
remain pretty much untouched
[Music]
though once mom's in the pen word
travels quickly that milk's still the
best option
[Music]
[Music]
by the way if you haven't already check
out my other video where i built this
teardrop camper that i can tow behind my
bike
[Music]
now the pups are getting pretty playful
and curious and they aren't a big fan of
being in their pen anymore
but lucky for them they do get out free
to roam the yard and destroy the flower
beds for about an hour three or four
times a day
and by the end the last few that were
left didn't even get put in the pen
anymore they would just stick around
home
[Music]
now mom's job is a lot more hands-off
and she can play with the pups but nine
pups is a lot for anyone to handle
[Music]
[Music]
hmm
hmm
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
mom's work here is pretty much done as
the pups are fully weaned and i've got
their first set of shots and will slowly
start trickling out one by one to their
new forever homes
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so
so
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
