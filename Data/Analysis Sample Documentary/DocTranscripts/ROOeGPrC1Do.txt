this
is the
f-35b lightning
it's known as a fifth generation
multi-role aircraft with stealth
capability
but with a top speed of 1200 miles an
hour an operational ceiling of 50 000
feet
and the ability to land vertically onto
the deck of an aircraft carrier
to put it more simply this is the most
sophisticated fighter jet the world has
ever seen
[Music]
you can't go past that line
that's hundred million quids with a kit
they don't want us near it we can't get
closer than this no 100 million pounds
how much is that two million quid yeah
chicken feed what speeds yours top end
250 yeah that's about 1200 miles per
hour that one i thought you're supposed
to be a fan of the car you're on the
side of the car you present the car show
i'm just i'm refereeing i'm i'm you know
i'm standing off from both of them
doesn't sound like it to me it sounds
like you're in the corner of the plane
to me
in the game of top trumps with that jet
in this car at the minute this car's not
doing that well but i've got everything
around the track right are we ready for
this gooseman
paddy come on we agreed no
top gun dork call me i'm maverick i'm no
known as maverick why you maverick
maverick's the cool one
so now that we've met the competition
next the referee wanted to go over the
rules of the race
gentlemen pretty straightforward this
we're going to make our way down this
straight here through the orange markers
all the way down there gonna do a left
then you're gonna do a left down here
another left
along the straight to the finishing line
first across the finish line wins any
questions
yeah the
the jet can't quite exactly do that so
what i'm going to do is i'm going to be
at 250 feet 400 miles an hour at this
turn we'll put the bank on it'll be a
limiter pull to get to 35 alpha to
minimize the radius of the turn to then
parallel the disused runway we'll roll
out level i'll continue down there'll be
another left turn again 7g 400 miles an
hour limiter pull round the corner to
roll out we'll continue up i'm not going
to make this turn left here it's too
tight i'm going to continue off again
250 feet this time at 500 miles an hour
to enter this turn 7g sustained to then
bleed down 35 alpha so you can see the
jets skidding around the corner to then
roll wings level 100 foot 550 mile an
hour finish
with the car down here
[Laughter]
hang on a second
who's that
the pilot
looks about 18.
they start them young now all right okay
all okay yeah
all right let's turn and burn lads do
you know what that is coffee cup correct
let's get out of here let's do it wings
up
[Music]
with the engineers now pouring over
every detail of their machines before
the race
suffice to say both teams were taking
things seriously
and with final checks complete
it was time
to take to the track
[Music]
that's fairly intimidating
[Music]
wow
what a piece of kit
f35 versus speed tail it's the coolest
thing i've ever done
look at the thing it just looks like an
engine with a person strapped to the
front of it
christopher are you
ready as i'll ever be
here we go then
ready steady go
i'm off
[Music]
where's the jets
[Music]
come on mr mclaren come on mr mcmahon
i'm on the car
okay here we go last corner
oh oh he's ahead
wayne's going to do the big loop peter
this is where we'll get our time
where is he where is he
i can see the f-35
got it
got it
[Music]
that is one of the coolest pieces of
engineering i've ever seen if i'm going
to lose to anyone
i'm going to lose to that
[Music]
