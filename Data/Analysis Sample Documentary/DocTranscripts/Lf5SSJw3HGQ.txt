how do i film, edit, color grade the videos that i 
shoot on my iPhone 13 Pro Max?! i'm about to share  
all of it with you like right now
well if you've seen any of my recent short films 
the Yosemite one the Light and Shadows one which  
were all a hundred percent shot on this iPhone 13 
Pro Max you may have wondered to yourself, "dang,  
how did Bryan shoot and edit and color grade all 
of this footage? it looks cinematic it definitely  
doesn't look like it was shot on an iphone" so 
i wanted to make this video to share with you  
guys my secrets my tips my tricks on exactly how 
i created these films and if you are shooting with  
the iPhone 13 i'm hoping this video will help 
you to go create some amazing content right in  
the palm of your hand now if you didn't know i'm 
shooting all of this footage in Cinematic mode  
now i did do a full review on Cinematic mode if 
you want to check that video out click up above  
but cinematic mode on the iPhone 13 simply offers 
you 30 frames per second at 1080p resolution in  
Dolby Vision HDR so you can't actually manipulate 
the settings beyond that i personally think the  
footage still looks really good but one thing i'm 
not a huge fan of is that 30 frames per second  
it just looks a bit more like footage for a soap 
opera or like live tv sports and the news one of  
the first things that i do when i get my footage 
into my video editing software adobe premiere pro  
is actually set my project frame rate to 23.976 
and then i take my 30 frames per second footage  
and slow it down by 80 percent and this 
gives me a much smoother feeling footage  
if you take a look at some of these shots here 
comparing the 30 frames per second footage  
to that same footage slowed down by 80 percent 
you can definitely see a huge difference  
now also when you're shooting in Cinematic 
mode you have two camera focal length options  
the 1x camera and the 3x i pretty much shoot 
all of my footage with the 1x camera which is  
a 26 millimeter focal length and i found that 
the artificial depth of field that Cinematic  
mode creates is just better with the 1x camera 
i do shoot some stuff at the 3x camera but i'm  
typically not trying to create any depth of field 
with it additionally i keep my aperture at f 2.8  
i like a more shallow depth of field again this 
all helps to create a much more cinematic look i  
could bump the aperture to like f8 or i think it 
even goes all the way up to f16 but i just prefer  
a more shallow depth of field it just gives you 
more of that like it was shot on a cinema lens  
one thing i do when i open up the camera go to 
Cinematic mode and shoot is adjust the exposure  
i've personally found that the iPhone exposure 
right at zero just feels a little too bright  
not that it's overexposed but it just feels 
a bit too bright for me so i usually take it  
down to like negative one and it also saves me 
a little bit of time in post-processing because  
that much closer to the final product in terms of 
coloring and exposure and all of that for my light  
and shadows video i actually used my Ronin-S 
gimbal and kind of rigged it to a piece to an  
iPhone tripod it was kind of a sketchy situation 
so i wouldn't recommend that you don't need  
that nice of a gimbal for your iPhone what 
i actually bought recently is the DJI OM 5  
and it's much more adequate for the job at a 
much better price point it's only 160 bucks it  
keeps a fantastic battery charge on it you 
can get really smooth shots with it you can  
run with it it just does the job probably 
about 80 percent of my shots maybe even 90  
of my shots are with the gimbal and then i do some 
handheld stuff if i'm getting tight detail shots i  
usually don't want to be like trying to get into 
tighter spaces with the gimbal and if i don't  
need to be like running around with it you know 
it's easy to just take it out of your pocket and  
shoot with it like that without having to get the 
gimbal set up i would definitely recommend this  
for sure it's linked in the description click on 
that link spend 160 bucks and get smoother footage  
i personally use Adobe Premiere Pro to color 
grade all of my footage and what i typically  
do is actually create two iterations of Lumetri 
color the first iteration of Lumetri color is  
usually going to be adjusting basic settings 
things like white balance exposure highlights  
and shadows some basic tone curve adjustments now 
keep in mind just the unedited Cinematic mode of  
footage already looks good so i find that i don't 
have to do a ton of crazy just basic adjustments  
so that's all within that first iteration of 
Lumetri color then i add an additional Lumetri  
color and start to really dial in specifically 
on the red green and blue tone curves this is  
where i might add even more vibrance saturation 
a lot more color and creative adjustments on that  
second Lumetri color you might be asking well 
bran why do you do the two layers of Lumetri  
color why not just do one and i found that with 
two layers of Lumetri color i can make a lot more  
subtle yet still dynamic adjustments to the 
footage i'm color grading with just one Lumetri  
color i found that i'm pushing the sliders and the 
control points a lot more to achieve the results  
that i want it just ends up looking over edited 
i wish i could give you an exact science to this  
but so much of what i'm doing is referencing other 
filmic looks films that i'm personally a fan of  
just replicating that cinematic color now with all 
of that in mind i'm super stoked to share with you  
guys two preset packs that are for adobe premiere 
one is based on the Yosemite short film and one  
is based on the Light and Shadows film if you go 
to the link in the description you can actually  
buy those preset packs and with like one click get 
the colors that i've been able to achieve i spent  
a lot of time dialing in these colors and really 
getting them to look very filmic very cinematic  
they're specifically tailored for that cinematic 
mode footage you can try it on other iPhone  
footage as well check the link in the description 
and get those creamy yummy delicious cinematic  
colors the only other thing i do that makes my 
footage feel very cinematic is add those black  
bars to the top and the bottom of the footage 
and that just gives you that more anamorphic  
widescreen classic film look to it and i simply do 
this by adding an adjustment layer and from there  
i add a crop effects to the adjustment layer do a 
15 crop on the top and the bottom of the footage  
and there you go typically when i just have a 
bunch of unedited iPhone shots i'm gonna start  
cutting up and finding some of my most epic 
and eye-catching shots first and then i'll  
jump over to logic pro and start working on the 
music and usually i'll get a rough idea down for  
the soundtrack and i'll get that idea over into 
premiere and start cutting a lot more of the film  
and it's a bit of a back and forth between the 
music and the cutting until i find a really good  
spot with the music and then finish the cutting in 
premiere and then finalize the music in logic this  
is probably one of the most time consuming parts 
is getting all of that to sync up and making sure  
the story both visually and sonically makes sense 
and meshes well together if you guys didn't know  
which i would imagine you do at this point but i 
did start a music licensing company called Moods  
Sound Design i've personally been producing 
music for over a decade now and i thought  
with my video experience as well as my music 
production experience might as well join those  
forces and create a company that offers just good 
music to videographers and filmmakers so if you  
need good music for your videos which if you're 
already making epic cinematic mode footage with  
your iPhone you probably do need good music go to 
MoodsSoundDesign.com and start a free trial with  
us and you're probably going to find some pretty 
sick music for your next video project so i hope  
you're inspired and stoked by this video to go 
out and create something epic with your iPhone  
technology is getting pretty crazy with these 
things and i'm super excited to see where it goes  
within the next few years go get those preset 
packs sign up for Moods Sound Design it's all  
linked in the description and if you hit that like 
button as well as the subscribe button that would  
just warm my heart thank you guys so much for 
watching i'll see you on the next video peace!
