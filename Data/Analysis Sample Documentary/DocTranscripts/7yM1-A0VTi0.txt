today it's well known that by April 1945
most of the Nazi leadership found
themselves cut off and surrounded by
Massive Soviet forces in Berlin
amongst them were Adolf Hitler and his
soon-to-be wife Eva Brown
neither would Escape
but what really happened in those Final
hours and where did the drama unfold
in this short video we'll use all the
latest available technology and mapping
techniques to pinpoint to the very meter
where Hitler's bunker lay and what
passed there in the final days of his
life
[Music]
first off we need to head to Berlin and
the central or Zed Zone as it was known
to the city's Defenders
this is the area in which a mixture of
die-hard Nazis and reluctant old men and
young boys found themselves fighting for
their lives once the Noose had closed
around the capital
included in this Central area with a
famous reichstag rice chancelloric
goring's air Ministry and of course the
fury bunker itself
for students of this period it's
generally understood that the fury
bunker was located under this rather
non-descript car park and that Hitler
committed suicide and his body was
burned in this vicinity but where
exactly did that happen
the first key piece of evidence in
finding the exact location of the fury
bunker comes from wartime schematics
created for the building of the bunker
in 1944. it shows a two-level complex
the upper part named the vorbonca and
the lower part the fura bunker
with dozens of rooms protected by meters
of reinforced concrete and
state-of-the-art gas protection it was a
formidable structure
now we know from records that the
vorbunker pre-existed the fury bunker
was used as an air raid shelter until
1943.
it was located directly beneath the old
rice Chancellor in the heart of Berlin's
government quarter and made up around 16
small cell-like rooms which included
storage for luggage Provisions a
generator toilets a canteen and several
small accommodation rooms which would be
taken over by the Goebbels family in
late April
the fury bunker itself came as a later
addition completed in 1944 two meters
deeper and linked to the war bunker by a
single passageway
one of the most Junior Personnel in the
bunker at that time was radio operator
rocus Mich
he described his first impression of the
fury bunker in detail
Donald last couple of steps and finally
we were the Deep bunker Hitler's Banker
Suite
construction work had begun far too late
and it was not ready having not dried
out
because of the remaining dump on the
wall it smelled stale
I looked around and screwed up my eyes
getting accustomed only slowly to the
harsh light of the naked lump bolts
how minute everything was how sad
unready unworthy
the rice post technician explains the
division of the rooms to me
they were no more than cells the
corridor was only 50 meters long and
divided into two halves by a concrete
bulkhead and a door
on the left was firefighting equipment
and on the other wall a long narrow
table with chairs
white at the end was another bulkhead
behind which was an emergency axis into
the Rice kansfly Garden
in the first room on the right of the
corridor technician hair show worked at
his machinery
a diesel generator and various pumps
which supplied fresh water
opposite the Machinery room on the left
side where the so-called red rooms a
bathroom and toilets immediately
adjoining hand Shields was my room with
a telephone switchboard which was
without the door and opened to the whole
floor
as well as the telephone room there were
four others
first one came to an anti-room with a
table and four chairs on the left hand
side
from this room it was possible to access
another room occupied by Dr Morel and
later Goebbels
to the right the corridor went down to
linger's room and the surgery and
dressing station
zenwon reached Hitler's rooms
the first one on the left LED
immediately into a Lobby from there one
went left into a womb intended as
Hitler's dressing room but which was
taken by IFA Brown
the lobby led him to Hitler's study and
living rooms even these rooms were only
3.5 by 3.2 meters in size
in the living room a sofa and three
chairs were squashed together
the big furniture pieces made the room
look cramped
from here one turned white into Hitler's
bedroom with a bed in the far corner
on the other side one crossed a small
floor into a red room with toilet and
shower
then reached ifa's room
here photoshell lamps hung from the
ceiling
from the central Corridor the second
door led into the map room which in the
final weeks military situation
conferences were held
despite its tightness
after my first two of the bunker I was
greatly relieved to step out into the
garden through the emergency exit
I began to sense what it meant to have
to ensure this over a long period of
time and also realize that for me such a
time was Dawning
as we heard the whole complex was pretty
uninspiring perpetually damp concrete
walls sparse Furnishing tightly enclosed
rooms no natural light and the constant
hum of generators and pumps made life
highly unpleasant for those in the
bunker including Hitler who by mid-april
would descend and with the exception of
a few short trips to the surface would
remain underground for the rest of his
life
so how do we find out exactly where this
bunker was with real accuracy
the first step lies in Wartime aerial
photographs taken by the allies during
flights over Berlin in March 1945.
this photograph of the central
government District highlights many key
buildings the air Ministry the old and
new reichs chancellery the Brandenburg
gate the spray River and the reichstag
these we can use as sort of signpost to
accurately identify the spot
one of the problems in finding the fewer
bunker at post-war Berlin is that the
city was so badly damaged in 1945 that
many buildings were pulled down and much
of the road layout changed when the city
was rebuilt but some of those major
markers still exist and we know haven't
moved
so let's take modern Berlin and compare
it to the 1945 aerial to recreate
Hitler's government quarter as it looked
at the time
this isn't that simple either we need to
know that the original photograph
perspective is correct
satellite images are generally fine
they're taken from a height of around
450 kilometers so we know the imagery is
straight down but wartime aerial photos
taken at a much lower level are often
slightly oblique an error of just a
fraction of a degree can throw out an
actual positioning by hundreds of meters
at the least so we need to triangulate
that is to say highlight key positions
in Berlin on all corners of this map and
compare them to the modern imagery so
let's try it
these are great markers the bridge over
the river spray to the north of the
reichstag which still exists in the same
spot as in 1945. this corner of the
reichstag building which again we know
hasn't changed here a distinctly shaped
building on the same road which leads to
the old reich's chancery
and we can see that each of these
locations matches with the 1945 image
with a good degree of accuracy and that
further to the South the edge of the
famous potsdammer Platt also fits as it
should telling us that the wartime image
perspective is accurate and therefore
our overlay is correct too
so we know that works let's zoom into
the government headquarters District
here we can see that in the post-war
years those famous government buildings
have almost all been replaced with
blocks of flats restaurants a children's
play area and most notably a car park
this we know is broadly the area where
the reichs chancellor is to be found in
1945.
one problem with actually finding the
bunker is pretty obvious it's
underground which makes aerial
reconnaissance of limited use but we do
know from this contemporary image of the
bunker that a few parts of the complex
remained above ground namely an
observation tower with a distinctive
ConEd roof and a squared emergency exit
into the rice chancellery Gardens
it's not easy to do with 1945 quality
photographs but we can actually identify
these key objects right here on the map
the Tower and the building are both just
about visible and give us a good
guideline as to where the bunker was
now to add the bunker complex itself
using those two above ground points we
can blend out the historic map and
identify the spots directly beneath on
the modern ground
by marking these two key locations on
the modern view we have at least two
accurate points of reference including
the distance between them which gives us
the scale
but to triangulate we need a third this
is a bit more difficult we need to
consult this excellent 3D plan of both
the bunker and the old Chancery Hall to
achieve it
we can see here that the bunker complex
actually starts directly beneath the
hull and we can see that on the aerial
so by taking common points at the edge
of the building and marking those on the
new map we can triangulate the exact
position of the bunker
now we repeat the same process embedding
our specially drawn bunker plan into the
modern map to identify the exact
location with real certainty of exactly
where the fura bunker lay
interestingly it's slightly further
south than many people suppose towards
the southern end of the car park and
slightly under a block of flats but
still in the same vicinity
and so it was right here in late April
that Hitler and Eva Brown met their end
but can we use this same mapping to
track those events
eyewitness testimony tells us that by
the end of April Hitler had finally
admitted he was not going to be leaving
Berlin alive and that the war was lost
which In fairness had been obvious to
everybody except him apparently for many
months Eva Brown too knew this and
seemingly had come to Berlin with the
express purpose of dying alongside
Hitler
to many people's surprise though and
notary was called and made a perilous
journey through Berlin to reach the
bunker it was here just after midnight
on the 29th of April that Hitler and Eva
Brown married with either famously
beginning to sign her surname Brown
before Crossing it out and writing
Hitler instead
unsurprisingly it wasn't much of a
honeymoon with the Newlywed spending a
little time with the last remaining
residents of the bunker including Mr and
Mrs Goebbels and their six young
children in fact the Hitler's the best
man the witnesses and even the notary
who performed the marriage would all be
dead within days
by late on the 29th Russian guns were
pounding the government district and
Soviet tanks were less than a kilometer
away from the bunker around 2 A.M on the
30th Hitler summoned his secretary
Charles younger to whom he dictated his
last will and testament appointing
Admiral Karl dernitz as the new
president of Germany on the 30th of
April Hitler called his adjutant Otto
guncher and valet Heinz linger and
informed them of his and Eva's plans to
commit suicide
with news of the public display and
maltreatment of Mussolini's body the day
before in Italy Hitler was desperate to
escape the same undignified fate and so
issued orders that the vehicles in the
nearby garage were to be drained of
their fuel and their bodies burned after
death originally it was believed that
Hitler intended to poison himself using
cyanide Supply by Heinrich Himmler
though when Hitler learned that Himmler
had been secretly discussing peace terms
with the Allies he feared betrayal and
that the poison Himmler had given him
would not be effective so instead he
tried it on his beloved dog Blondie
it worked
some short time later after assembling
the remaining staff and saying their
goodbyes to their Inner Circle Hitler
and Ava made their way to this small
damp room in the fury bunker where
sitting on a couch Ava bit down on a
cyanide capsule whilst Hitler
simultaneously shot himself in the head
with his wealth of pistol
a few minutes later linger alongside
Martin Borman cautiously opened the door
to find Ava her lips purple from the
cyanide on the couch with her legs drawn
up around her and Hitler by her side
killed by a gunshot to the temple
linger described what happened next
while Poorman went outside to fetch help
I spread out the blankets laid the
bodies upon them and wrapped them around
Ava Hitler was carried out first Borman
picked her up in his arms and brought
the body over to the room where air his
camper took over because he did not like
the idea of the man she had despised in
life now carrying her to the Grave I
reached below Hitler's head two officers
from his bodyguard lifted the body
wrapped in a gray blanket and we carried
him out
records tell us that those carrying the
bodies travel through the fury bunker
and exit via this doorway and that they
entered the badly shelled rice Chancery
Gardens where they found a showhole in
which to place the bodies here's linger
again
immediately in front of the bunker door
in the chancellory garden his body was
lit next to ethos in a small depression
but gasoline was poured over the bodies
and an attempt was made to set them a
night at first this proved impossible as
there was a fierce wind circulating I
returned to the back and made a sixth
spell from some signal papers Walmart
knitted and sued onto Hitler's petrol's
hook body which caught fire immediately
standing by the banker entrance we the
last Witnesses raised our hand for a
last Hitler's salute
so where exactly did this take place
by turning the clock forward from our
map we can reveal modern day Berlin and
very likely the exact spot where Ava and
Hitler's bodies were burned which is
rather fittingly in a totally
unremarkable Road Junction next to a
non-descript street in Central Berlin
with news of Hitler's death spreading
many in the bunker later reported
feeling like a spell had been broken
an individually or in groups most began
to flee vainly hoping to escape the fast
approaching Soviets most wouldn't make
it
the Goebbels family were an exception
having murdered their six children in
their beds with cyanide on the 1st of
May they too headed to this same area of
the Chancery Gardens
where Goebbels drew his pistol shot his
wife and then himself
the pair also being burned in the show
hole
Joseph and Magda goebel's bodies would
later be positively identified through
the device Goebbels War for his club
foot which was found amongst the charred
remains
the goebbel's children wouldn't be found
for another two days still in their beds
in the bunker
within 24 hours of Hitler's death the
Russians had captured the reichstag at
all meaningful defense in Central Berlin
ceased shortly thereafter
and the race to find Hitler began
shrouded in controversy and secrecy to
this day it was unclear as to where and
when Hitler's remains were discovered
but it was likely about five days later
by Soviet troops who kept it a secret
from the Western allies in fact Stalin
claimed they'd not found him at all and
this spawned a long persistent myth that
Hitler may have escaped the encirclement
of Berlin and fled to safety location
unknown
the reality is far less dramatic Hitler
was found and his almost completely
burned remains identified relatively
quickly
one of the few remnants to survive the
fire were Hitler's teeth and part of his
lower jaw
very quickly the Soviets found Hitler's
dentist's assistant and got her to
sketch from memory a plan of hit as
extensive and almost unique dental work
which perfectly matched The Remains
discovered in the chancellory gardens
not only that but gunsha linger Mish his
chauffeur kemka and several other
Witnesses all saw Hitler's body were
part of the group that burned it and
were subject to brutal interrogation by
the Soviets about the events for years
afterwards had there been another
version it would have certainly come out
at the time
what's more even after repatriation to
the West all the witnesses continue to
tell the same story The Myth though and
it is a myth persisted with sightings
the theories around Hitler's Escape
continuing to this day
so did a seriously ill Hitler even
remotely possibly escape the bunker in
Berlin well unless there's a tunnel
under this spot leading directly to
South America he didn't and even if
there was he didn't take his teeth with
him and a large portion of his jaw both
of which today reside in a Moscow
archive
so what became of the bunker itself as
we know the Soviets captured and
retained control of Berlin at the end of
the war and when the city was later
divided into four the bunker remained
just inside the Soviet zone
some attempts were made to destroy the
remnants and above ground sections were
destroyed when Redevelopment finally
took place in the 1990s some parts of
the bunker were uncovered and a few
Berlin residents even managed to make
their way inside and capture some rare
photographs before those visible
remnants were destroyed or filled in by
work Crews it's likely though not
certain that even to this day parts of
the bunker complex still exist
relatively intact beneath this spot in
Berlin
and so this unassuming location today
still May retain some of its history
albeit out of sight to those who walk
these streets and maybe that's how it
should be
personally I think it's fitting that the
end of one of the world's most horrific
regimes and the man responsible for it
is largely unremembered here
and the only a Stones throw away lies a
powerful Memorial commemorating millions
of those he put to death
this should be obvious but to clarify
the idea behind this video of course is
not to commemorate an individual or to
condone an ideology but simply to
highlight a location where at one time
and in one moment history came to pass
foreign
