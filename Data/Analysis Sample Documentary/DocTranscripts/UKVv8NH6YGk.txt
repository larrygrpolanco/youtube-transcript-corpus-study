what happens next may take your breath
away and hopefully get you thinking
the magnitude of that moment did not
escape the nation's view
six-year-old ruby bridges and four
federal marshals
we've been sent by the president of the
united states and we are here to escort
you to school today
the governor of the state decided that i
will not
force my people to integrate against
their will
going through this kind of living hell
what would you expect
crowds of protesters lined to the
streets
teachers at the school refused to
instruct her governor
george wallace who blocked by literally
standing in the door
200 people waiting at 8 30 in the
morning to tell her they were going to
kill her
then they had a machine gun beside their
guns they threatened to poison ruby
president of the united states and
troops you are one of my heroes
i'm here because of you the governor
called the national guard all because of
just one little girl
he pulled his gun to shoot things were
gonna get really worse
i can't believe this kind of stuff
happens i would like to know what's
happening to her
until now she has never told the full
story of what happened to her
when they knocked on the door my parents
opened the door and i remember standing
there and seeing these
four very tall white men
i remember them saying that we're
federal marshals
we've been sent by the president of the
united states
and we are here to escort you and your
daughter to school today
i found myself in the car driving
this very short drive to this new school
and the minute we turned the corner
i saw what i thought was mighty girl
there were so many people standing out
in the middle of the street
and they were screaming and shouting and
throwing things
i draw the line in the dust and i say
segregation
now segregation tomorrow and segregation
forever
the car door opened and those federal
marshals they grabbed my hand
and i remember them saying ruby walk
straight ahead and don't look back
one of the city policemen he pulled his
gun to shoot
and everybody say they knew private to
kill me and says if they killed the
mother
the child wouldn't have went 200 people
waiting at 8 30 in the morning to tell
her they were going to kill
200 people in the afternoon telling you
they're going to kill her
the crowd would come and they would
bring a small
baby's coffin and they put this
black doll inside of the coffin and they
would march around
the school and i would have to pass it
to get inside of the building
and i used to have nightmares about the
coffin this is a people's movement
it doesn't make any difference whether
the major politicians are going to
support you or not
if they don't support us in this
movement to take
back our government and give it to us
and let us run our own institutions
those who stand in the way are liable to
get run over
when i got inside of the building i
remember it being very
quiet i received a call from the
superintendent's office
and asking me if i would like to take a
first grade position
that morning when i arrived of course
the anger
and the hostility was palpable i was
told
that if i went downstairs i would meet
my student
so i walked down to a cavernous basement
area of the school
those doors instantly opened and amidst
this
towering presence of federal marshals
stood the most beautiful little girl
one could ever dream of seeing looking
so
delicate so unaware of the mantle for
change she wore that day
and as i went over toward her to
introduce myself
she came forward and i think she felt
she was pretty special and she was
and she looked that way she beautiful
pink dress party dress
and as i walked over to meet her her
bowed head sort of raised gently
and a little smile came across her face
and then those beautiful big brown eyes
that she still has rose to nepal
and you know it was a case of love at
first sight
how could you not fall in love with a
child like that in a moment like that
and so leaving behind a cameo of the
past
ruby and i held our hands left them
walked together upstairs to our first
grade classroom
and began our solitary adventure i
remember looking at her
and thinking she's white
i've never seen a white teacher before
she looked exactly like the people
outside
she wasn't by the next day the crowds
had doubled
they kept pointing at me and shouting
kept saying we're gonna poison her we're
gonna hang her
i remember hearing my mom said that she
would send me the school
and that every day she would sit and
pray
all day to three o'clock until i walked
back through the door
and the federal marshals they met with
my parents and they said you should
prepare her lunch and she should eat it
at her desk
they actually thought that i was afraid
of being poisoned and i remember them
coming to me
and saying why were you not eating
and why did you lie and i said
because i want to eat lunch in the
cafeteria with the other kids
the minute we got to the cafeteria and
they pushed open the doors
nothing but empty tables there were no
kids
and i remember being so disappointed
about that
i just knew they were in the cafeteria
i would go into this coat closet to hang
up my coat and every time i went into
the closet
i would hear kids voices
and i would mention it to my teacher and
she wouldn't say anything
and there were days when i would go back
into the closet and i would just stand
there
just to see if i really heard them and i
did
you see there were white parents who
tried to send their kids to school with
me
those white parents had to cross the
same picket line that i did
and they were never protected by federal
marshals as they crossed the picket line
the principal would take the kids and
she would hide them
so they would never see me and i would
never see them
i went up to the principal and i said
why are they not with ruby
and she said well that teacher won't
teach her
and i said well i will teach them and so
shortly thereafter they would come and
join us for the afternoon
and i do remember that beginning where
those three or four little kids just
gingerly walked
into that room because that was the
first time they had ever been
in a classroom with a black child i went
in to sit down
to play with them but that is the day
because a little boy looked at me and he
said i can't play with you
my mom said not to play with you because
you're
and the minute he said that i remember
to this very day
it felt as if this weight lifted off my
shoulders
all of a sudden by him saying that i
knew
why there were no kids there
and the truth is even though he hurt my
feelings
i was never angry with him
because in my mind i thought he was
explaining to me
why he couldn't play with me he said
my mom said not to play with you
and i thought to myself if my mom
had said ruby don't play with him
he's asian don't play with him
he's indian he's hispanic he's white
if my mom had said not to play with him
i would not have played with him
so i wasn't angry with him i understood
one cannot underestimate the courage of
ruby
and the power a child has i believe it
was in the best interest of white and
black
uh to be in a segregated school system
but i was wrong
our children need to know that white
folks
black folks they stood together
thank god for the teacher that was there
she was my best friend
and she taught me the lesson that dr
king tried to teach
each and every one of us and that is we
should never judge a person by the color
of their skin
[Applause]
i always say that she showed me her
heart we had a grand time together i
think side by side than just the two of
us
i believe that if we are going to get
past our racial differences
it's going to come from our kids but we
as adults have to allow them
opportunities to come together i think
it's important for kids to dream
and be able to believe that they can
follow those dreams
i don't think i would be here today if i
wasn't dreaming
