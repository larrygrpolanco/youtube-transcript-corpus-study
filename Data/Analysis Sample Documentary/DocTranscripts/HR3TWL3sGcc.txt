Mark Cavendish is gonna burst for the line
The Manx-missile is back!
 Just look at this, this is the man they call the 
Max Missile, the fastest man in the world
what a  delivery by Mark Cavendish, this man is unstoppable, 
he came past the rest with unbelievable acceleration
Unbelievable stuff! Mark Cavendish
When he sees the finish he is absolutely 
impossible to beat. Mark Cavendish gets his 13th victory in the Tour de France
He's just an unbelievable finisher, the fastest sprinter on the planet
Mark Cavendish has cemented himself as the greatest sprinter of all time following his miraculous comeback last year
at the age of 36, he became cycling weekly's rider of the year  
and in the eyes of many he's become an icon 
of the sport
his resume lacks little, and  includes more than 150 professional wins, a third of those are grand tour stages
the Manx missile was born to sprint  
a pure sprinter who is equipped with fast 
twitch muscle fibers allowing him to accelerate  
instantaneously with explosive power, and reach 
top speeds of nearly 80 kilometres per hour  
growing up in the Isle of Man, Mark developed a 
passion for speed, but his speed is just one of  
the many keys to his success
 over 70 percent 
of the sprinter's work goes into fighting drag  
that's where aerodynamics come into play
professional teams spend so much time effort 
and money studying their riders positions on  
the bike looking for ways to improve them. 
However, using an aero position in a sprint  
comes with a cost, for most riders this is 
not a comfortable position for sprinting  
because it lowers the maximum power 
that can be generated this explains  
why many sprinters prefer more comfortable 
flexible and less aerodynamic positions  
maintaining such a low profile while sprinting is 
hard, but for a short guy like cavendish it's his  
natural sprinting position he makes no effort 
to maintain it
Mark Cavendish is being challenged by Robbie McEwen, but htis is the new Robbie McEwen
pure sprinters, and there aren't many, and i think he  he took it to another level
one of the big things about that makes Cav so successful 
his actual body shape and the way he's positioned 
on the bike makes him so incredibly aerodynamic  
he's got pretty short legs and and short little 
arms and it just puts him into this aerodynamic  
position without having to sort of contort his 
body to try and get down and get aerodynamic  
just by reaching down into the drops, makes 
him look like a time trial helmet on a bike  
his small size allows him to get the most out 
of slipstreaming others while they hardly get  
any drafting advantage out of riding on his wheel 
Caleb Ewan adopted a similar posture and took it to the extreme 
it proved to be very effective 
giving him a 15% advantage in terms of speed  
compared to standard sprinting positions. Because 
these two riders are super aero and comfortable at  
the same time they are able to compensate the 
gap in power against much more powerful peers  
he doesn't need to put out the same sort of power 
as someone like Greipel for instance  
who's for the cycling people he's putting 
out something like 1800 watts
or Kittel who's putting out 1800 or 1900 watts. Cav can go the 
same speed by putting out 1350
Even for the casual viewer his sprinting style is noticeably 
different from the rest it's not just his smooth  
and perfectly circular pedaling but also the way 
his core stays centered his head is barely moving  
like a sprinting cheetah limiting the amount 
of air disturbance around him and keeping air  
resistance at a low. But that doesn't mean his body 
is inflexible during the sprint and while he's  
having a tight grip on the handlebars his elbows 
are freely moving swinging his bike left and right  
in what he calls 'bringing the bike to the feet' 
in order to achieve maximum sprinting efficiency
on an ideal day, Cavendish would have a 
number of teammates do the work for him  
as the race approaches the finish. It's called a 
lead out train, their job is to keep the race under  
their control and carry Mark to the 200 meters to 
go marker. When the train is lined up each rider is  
doing nearly 40 percent less effort than the rider 
in front of him, by sitting at the back Cavendish  
can travel at the same speed as the rider at 
the front while barely pedaling. He doesn't  
necessarily need a team around him in order 
to get a win but it makes his job a lot easier  
Cavendish is a man who calculates every detail in 
his head, like anyone who is obsessive-compulsive  
he wants everything to be perfect. In an old 
interview Mark said: it's not just about my frontal  
area in a sprint, it's everything beforehand, how 
i ride in the peloton, my pedaling action, how I  
sit, I save so much energy for the finish. Mark 
does very minimal effort throughout the day  
when there's a possible sprint at the 
end of the stage he doesn't put 100  
effort into the intermediate sprints even if the 
two sprints are hours apart at the end of the race  
he knows exactly how deep he can go and he's not 
only good at managing effort throughout the race  
he also excels at managing his efforts 
throughout the final sprint as well  
when he's fresh he could pull off an 18 second 
sprint while an exhausted Cavendish might prefer  
jumping on the wheels of other sprinters and 
launch the sprint a few seconds later the length  
of the sprint depends on that and also depends 
on the wind direction and steepness of the road  
these variables make each and every sprint 
different. Going for long distances requires a  
wise distribution of effort, and as he once said: 
it's not about your absolute maximum wattage  
it's about how long you can hold that high wattage 
for the whole sprint. Given the uniqueness of  
each finish there is no set range from which you 
always open up the sprint knowing exactly when to  
attack is one of Cavendish's greatest weapons it's 
impressive how he times his sprint to perfection  
when the finish line is within sight riders can 
easily misjudge distance as nervousness takes over  
a common mistake is to go for a long way out 
which could work in your opponents' favor  
the most likely result is a defeat
Unless it's tailwind
Cavendish decides to light it, he's gonna go long
here comes Cavendish, his head down, he's running for the line
maybe Viviani has to battle and go for minor places here, but is it gonna be Mark Cavendish as he heads for the line
oh the right jersey makes it in the lead
in this sprint Cannondale the team in 
green were counting on their lead-out  
train to deliver their man to the 200 
meters point. But Cavendish decides  
to open up the sprint from 350 meters out 
surprising everybody with a very early jump  
when everybody started accelerating he had 
already picked up momentum and was on a par  
with them in terms of position had he waited 
till the 200 meters marker to launch his sprint  
winning would have been impossible. He was able 
to cover that distance in 15 seconds that's a  
very long range but thanks to the tailwinds and 
the surprise factor he managed to pull it off
in some rare situations Mark prefers 
not to sprint in the center of the road  
specifically when he finds himself at the 
front of the pack with a long way to go  
after getting delivered by a lead out. He launches 
the sprint from the center of the road then goes  
sideways with a closer look you'll notice a 
number of riders sitting on his slipstream  
once he switches lanes they follow which 
creates an overcrowded area that causes  
a bunch of his opponents to get boxed in they 
eventually miss out on the sprint. In other words  
he just brings a random portion of riders that 
may threaten his chances of winning to a halt  
however he has received a ton of criticism 
in the past for this aggressive style  
switching lanes and improvising in mid-sprint 
are also some of the actions he tends to take  
when he's badly positioned or when he 
realizes he might have gone too early  
he is very good at picking wheels 
that have the best potential  
he looks left and right searching for sweet 
spots for riders to use as shelter from the wind
when he spots one he goes for it sits 
on the slipstream to take a breath  
and relaunches the sprint shortly afterwards
Viviani being dropped a little bit too far back 300 meters to go. 
300 meters to go now it looks like Alexander  
Kristoff on the left hand to the center of 
your screen sat in the saddle powering along  
he opens up his sprint now Mark Cavendish is on 
the wheel of Alexander Kristoff, Viviani on the  
left-hand side Kristoff goes Cavendish
in the middle, Cavendish in the middle  
Cavendish takes it what a victory for the Manxman 
wow what a sprint that was!
 it's now or never time, the bells have rang and this is the time you've got to go or just pack up and go home
Cav gets himself into position Haussler is
there oh my life
a millimetre could decide a 300 kilometre race, such cases are 
not uncommon in professional cycling
the bike throw may not be Cavendish's most 
powerful weapon but it is there whenever  
he needs it and it's something 
that every cyclist should master  
it's a technique that allows the rider to have 
an edge over his opponents at the finish line  
if executed perfectly over 30 centimeters or 
the equivalent of one foot could be gained  
you can perform a bike through by stretching 
the back out extending the arms and legs forward  
and thrusting the bike across the line with 
force to move the bike as far forward as possible
can you talk about its mentality perhaps how he differs to other riders his particular type of character 
when he focuses on something, he's almost scary
I always wanted to be the best, 
I still want to be the best, I still believe I'm the best 
I've never looked back on what 
I've done even before i was cycling you know  
when I achieve something, I set a goal that I want 
to achieve. The day after I achieved it I
set a new goal you know that's always how it 
was and that's how it'll continued to be you know  
self-confidence is commonly defined as the 
sureness of feeling that you are equal to the task  
at hand this sureness is characterized by absolute 
belief in ability in the case of Mark Cavendish  
his confidence is reflected in everything he 
says and does it is reflected in his ability  
to bounce back from failures and it can be seen 
in his charisma and aggressive style on the bike
sprinters have to be an extroverting character 
because of the explosive nature of the side of  
the sport that they practice they have to appear 
brash they have to appear outgoing
they have to be confident they're like boxers 
you know you don't get into the ring and say yeah  
well i'm going to do my best today i'll see how it goes 
you gotta get in there and saying I'm gonna win 
I want to kill this guy I want to knock him to 
the ground and that's what a sprinter has to do a  
sprinter has to have that character otherwise he's 
gonna finish second he's gonna finish third  
and sometimes that comes out as 
being cocky and cheeky and brash but  
actually deep down Mark Cavendish 
is a pretty cool character
his career is full of ups and downs we couldn't 
count how many times he crashed or how many  
bones he's broken throughout the years his mental 
strength and immunity against fear is exceptional  
and he's never hesitant to go back 
to the danger zone and do it again
cavendish's downfall began in 2017 after he 
was diagnosed with the epstein-barr virus  
it prevented him from performing at 
the highest levels for over two years  
in that period he went through 
numerous bad experiences
nothing seemed to be going his way his inability 
to compete consistently was starting to take its  
toll on his mental health something that 
led many cyclists before him to retire  
it was downright depressing for one 
who once was cycling's undisputed sprint king
Mark Cavendish I can see it, it was a really hard hard day for you
I see you're getting emotional how how was your 
day
that's perhaps the last race in my career now
do you really think this is your last race?
maybe yeah
did you want to show something?
but there's one thing that sets successful 
people like Cavendish apart from the rest  
he is not a quitter
