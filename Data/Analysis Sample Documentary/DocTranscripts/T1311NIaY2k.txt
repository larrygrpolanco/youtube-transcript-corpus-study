so when the pandemic started and people
were quarantined and locked down the
thought of staying with your family and
your kids inside the whole day was sort
of you know scary it made you realize
what what life's all about in a certain
sense the pandemic rebalanced
the focus and the purpose of life I
think families became stronger through
the long run
[Music]
you'll hear more about the day-to-day of
what it takes to raise
maintain a Pacific home
and raise the Next Generation
of Hasidic Jews
welcome to Minecraft city comb and this
is it your ankle you may remember Yanko
from the last video this is pearly my
niece this is my daughter Hannah thank
God we have eight kids
so people want to know how do you do it
and my answer is the same you gotta talk
to my wife
and that's exactly what we're gonna do
come let's go inside hey look your
Mickey Mouse Switcher
foreign
[Music]
the first time we met within five
minutes I knew what was it it's it's
can't be explained it's something
internal it's like it's a recognition of
like we you know we already Belong
Together We went on like 11
meetings you know like we met 11 times
and like two and a half weeks later we
were engaged literally but it was it was
this was after years of meeting other
people and and no no no and then when
you meet the right one you just know and
you know because you're not looking for
just a loving final relationship but
you're looking literally for someone to
share your life with and so the bar was
very high and I wasn't going to settle
and um
and we thank God every day
what we do very often is we say one of
the most famous verses
how the Torah
the five books of Moses is an
inheritance for every Jew it's like part
of us so
if he wants to
he'll be able to say the verse word by
word and the other kids will respond one
two three go Tyler
[Music]
David all the way from Surfside Florida
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
and this is our son Mendel he just
turned three and now till three years
old we don't cut the hair
but we want to show that when a kid till
they're three years old let them be
their natural selves and that's when you
have like the natural sort of
fundamental understanding of Life once
they turn three you cut the hair and you
leave the pace
the corners
and that represents that throughout
light life you can have all these big
ideas and creative ideas and you always
have to make sure that it comes down
into an action the payus so we don't cut
this area so he just had his upshurnish
that's what it's called his first hair
cutting Mendel is there anything you
want to say to the camera
[Music]
so women are invited into all the prayer
and all the but like over the holiday I
didn't go to to synagogue three times a
day like my husband did because I'm busy
with the children
and it's not like well it's you know
he's doing the holy work and I'm staying
home busy with it with the baby the
Holier work is taking care of the baby
we're partners with God we help bring
another Soul into the world
and until my baby is capable of taking
care of himself I'm there for him that
doesn't feel like a burden that's not
like oh I wish I could be somewhere else
that's like the greatest honor in the
world I had everything I was good before
I got married I was you know I was doing
great I had everything I was you know
successful and it wasn't enough I wanted
my husband I want my children I yearn
for them so to be with them that's the
holy work and then if I also have time
to pray God is like wow you know you're
taking care of my precious child and you
have time to pray to me amazing
and who makes everybody necessary is
is comes from the woman's yearning so we
just had an incredible week a whole week
of Passover in my mother's home
and you can't imagine what was going on
the amount of people here the amount of
food the amount of action the amount of
but what brought us all together here
what made it all possible is my mother's
Journey she wanted us all here you know
laughs
and we all felt that
[Music]
this is my dad he is Rabbi weberman the
chief Rabbi of Miami Beach where's Bibi
Netanyahu and this is my father who was
greeting him and welcome him to the city
of Miami Beach
so this guest book was a gift from my
mother-in-law to my husband her son to
your 50th birthday here is my gift on an
empty book with countless pages but very
soon they will start to fill up with
thanks and appreciation and her biggest
wishes that this should be filled up
very soon and she'll give him another
book for people to fill up
and how full are we now ah very full
down to the bottom and so every home is
built on a woman's yearning and the man
that husband responds to the woman's
yearning and gives her a home and gives
her himself and gives her children and
gives her provides anything she needs to
satisfy her yearning
welcome into the my most favorite room
of the house which is the kosher kitchen
do you know anything about kosher I'll
give you a quick crash course on kosher
come on in notice if there are any
slight differences in a kosher kitchen
than a regular kitchen
foreign
[Music]
double ovens
double sinks
double dishwashers and double microwaves
and it's not because it was buy one get
one free the day we bought them in the
Bible there's a verse Lo Savannah
the translation is do not cook the kid
goat in its mother's milk so when I will
cook my meat I will only use my meat
oven when I'm cooking my Dairy I will
only use my Dairy side of the kitchen
any animal that chew the cuds and has
split hooves can be used for kosher
consumption such as cow cows and sheep
and goats and lamb but it has to go
through a ritual slaughtering process in
order for us to be able to use that
kosher kind of an animal blood is not
kosher
so therefore all the blood from this
Kosher meat that was just slaughtered by
your ritual Slaughter needs to be drawn
out the only kosher poultry that we
would use today is what we know
traditionally our ancestors use and that
would be chickens turkey duck geese
every single egg that I will use I first
crack it open to a little glass dish and
I inspect the yolk to see if there's any
blood spots
doesn't happen too often but I do find
when you look for it you find it now
let's say you're traveling somewheres
and you may be in a place where
they do have kosher or they don't have
kosher food so we'll do a little
research in advance to find out if you
can purchase your kosher food there
um but if they nothing is available
then you would bring your food along
there's no difference between like who's
going to be cooking who's going to be
cleaning who's going to be that's
whatever works for each couple
the main thing is that the woman should
be able to be her natural self what's
her natural self in touch with her
yearning Big Boy what'd you get
yes oh
it's amazing lucky you lucky lucky you
the first man was Adam and he was male
and female in one body but God said it's
not good for man to be alone
so he's he's a normal human being he's
male and female but he's alone
so God separated the female from the
male and God said but don't stay apart
you can't stay separate that's not
natural come back together but this time
when you come back together you're going
to choose the Oneness and so marriage is
actually not a union but a reunion it's
bringing back two parts that were won
back together
[Music]
you got another coloring book yeah okay
show me how you make the circles
I'm gonna do a chain away this is Kate
oh my sister
this is Shayna and in Yiddish the name
Shayna means beautiful
shame
what is that
I did your voice
they need this of their hands right it's
a trophy thing
like the one because she always got some
necklace marriage means I want you
so we don't date until we're able to say
that I want you in my life you're
missing not something you're gonna give
me you are missing in my life
then we we tell a family relatives you
know any you know do you know somebody
I'm looking and then there's matchmakers
in our community there's many many
matchmakers and then when we go out we
don't date for the sake of dating and we
don't have any dating relationships we
meet
we meet people and it's you know
sometimes after the first date you're
like nice guy but not for me you do a
lot of research before you actually meet
you call his employer you call his
friends you call his anybody that knows
his family anyone that and you find out
is he the kind of person that I would
want to marry first it has to make sense
on paper then you actually go to meet
and see if there's the attraction
if the chemistry is there
but we don't want to waste people's time
God told Eve who was the first woman you
will yearn for your husband
might make it seem like she's going to
be the needy one and her husband is
going to be the one answering her call
because she yearns
but what does it mean to yearn to yearn
for that Oneness to say female is not
enough I want my male part
is is to be god-like
[Music]
okay do some tricks
[Music]
I'm gonna try to seal the ball away from
him and I can ready Echo
but the problem is I taught him
everything he knows watch this oh
I can't get it but look I'm still the
father and he can't get it from me
[Laughter]
