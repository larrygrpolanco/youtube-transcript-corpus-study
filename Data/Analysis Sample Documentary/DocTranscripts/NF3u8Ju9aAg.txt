at the end of the second world war
the cold war had begun the world lay
divided between two great superpowers
the united states and the soviet union
it would not be a conventional war with
the two sides never directly fighting
instead it would be an ideological
battle between communism
and capitalism the east first the west
and the resulting struggle for
ideological influence
and power both sides would stockpile
nuclear weapons
with questions over how to use control
and eliminate them
becoming central to the conflict from
stalin to reagan
from the arms race to the cuban missile
crisis
from the berlin wall to vietnam and
korea
this is the story of the cold war
[Music]
at the end of the second world war
europe lay divided between two camps the
soviet union
the world's leading communist power
would rule over what would become known
as the eastern bloc
after suffering almost 27 million
casualties during the war
soviet leader joseph stalin had been
keen to create a buffer zone against the
west
installing communist governments across
eastern europe
as former british prime minister winston
churchill would famously state
an iron curtain has descended across the
continent
the united states the world's leading
capitalist power
would also emerge as a post-war
superpower
their economy was thriving and they had
sole control of the most powerful weapon
in human history
the atomic bomb two of which president
harry truman had dropped on japan to end
the war
hostilities began when stalin delayed
the removal of soviet troops from iran
and pressured turkey into giving him
control over the turkish straits
wanting to stop soviet expansionism
president truman would announce the
truman doctrine
sending military aid to greece and
turkey
it was a policy aimed at containing the
soviet union
and would become the basis of american
cold war strategy for years to come
this policy was known as containment
fearing the spread of communism in
europe the united states would
also introduce the marshall plan in
april 1948.
it was thought that by improving
europe's economies communism would lose
its appeal
the plan provided almost 13 billion
dollars of financial aid
encouraging economic integration and the
promotion of free markets
germany was one of the most prominent
symbols of the newly divided world
having been split in half after the war
the soviets would occupy the east
with britain france and america
occupying the west
berlin despite laying 100 miles within
the soviet zone
was divided in the same way in june 1948
stalin would begin the berlin blockade
stopping all ground access to the city
in an attempt to drive out the americans
british and french
but truman quickly responded beginning
the berlin airlift
delivering supplies to the city for 15
months and forcing stalin to end at the
blockade
with tensions high the us and its allies
would establish an independent west
german state
the federal republic of germany the
soviets would respond
the following month by creating the
german democratic republic
in the east in response to soviet
expansion and influence
nato the north atlantic treaty
organization
was created in 1949 bringing together
the us
canada and most of western europe in a
defensive pact against the soviet union
to help stop the spread of communism the
cia would be established in september
1947
with the organization growing in size
and strength over the coming years
from 1949 to 1952
cia personnel would increase tenfold
with their overseas bases growing from 7
to 47
and their annual budget increasing from
4.7 million
to 82 million dollars they would go on
to interfere in developing countries
where independence movements were often
seen as potential paths to communism
in 1953 and 54 they would overthrow the
leaders of iran and guatemala
installing highly unpopular dictators in
their place
earning the organization an infamous
reputation
events in east asia would soon turn the
cold war into a global conflict
in china mao zedong had led communist
revolutionaries to victory in 1949
establishing the people's republic of
china
the u.s would respond by increasing
economic support to its new ally japan
in an attempt to stimulate economic
growth in the region
as well as sending aid to french
colonial forces in vietnam
who were fighting against a communist
independence movement
led by ho chi minh in 1950
communist north korea invaded south
korea
with domino theory at the height of
political thought the idea that if one
nation fell to communism
others would as well the united states
sent tens of thousands of american
troops to push the invaders back
north the korean war would drag on for
three years
with the armistice of july 1953 leaving
it so there was no clear victory for
either side
the border between the two careers had
hardly shifted at all
with the loss of life totaling over two
million
but crucially the korean war showed that
communism could be contained
the main thinking behind future
conflicts in particular
vietnam
after stalin's death in 1953 nikita
khrushchev had become leader
soon creating the warsaw pact to counter
the growing power of nato
but khrushchev would soon prove to be a
provocative and unpredictable leader
in november 1956 he would threaten
britain and france with rocket weapons
after they invaded egypt and he was
known for his emotional outbursts
allegedly banging his shoe on a table at
the 1960 united nations general assembly
when a new president john f kennedy came
to power in 1961
khrushchev made an attempt to secure
berlin
there had been around 2.7 million
defections from communist east germany
since 1949 most of which had escaped
through west berlin
securing the city was therefore vital to
the survival of the german democratic
republic
with defections usually of the highly
trained and educated
growing by the day at a 1961 meeting in
vienna
khrushchev gave kennedy six months to
vacate berlin
but kennedy refused now desperate
khrushchev authorized the construction
of the berlin wall
on august 12 1961 creating a physical
barrier between east and west berlin
starting as a barbed wire fence it soon
turned into a massive concrete block
wall
12 feet high and nearly 100 miles long
complete with armed guards and
minefields it was an embarrassment for
communists
everywhere
[Music]
[Music]
but kennedy was having difficulties of
his own cuba had been taken over by
communist revolutionaries in early 1959
led by fidel castro the revolutionaries
began freeing cuba of its economic and
political reliance on the us
eventually turning to the soviet union
for help
not wanting a communist nation so close
to home
kennedy attempted to topple castro from
power in the bay of pigs invasion
using a group of cia-trained cuban
exiles
but it would turn out to be a disaster
with the invaders surrendering
after just three days it was an
embarrassment to kennedy
and convinced khrushchev that he needed
to protect castro
with him sending nuclear missiles to the
island in 1962
american reconnaissance aircraft soon
spotted the missiles
causing kennedy to begin a naval
blockade of cuba to prevent any further
soviet shipments from arriving
a hundred and forty thousand u.s
invasion troops were then stationed in
florida
and the u.s alert system was raised to
defcon 2 for the first time in history
they were preparing for nuclear war
[Music]
as negotiations were underway a
confrontation in the atlantic
almost ended in disaster u.s ships had
used signaling depth
charges to alert a soviet submarine that
it had strayed too close to the blockade
thinking they were under attack the
submarine's captain ordered nuclear
torpedoes to be launched
but the decision required the approval
of all three onboard officers
one of the officers vasily arkipov
refused to go through with the launch
single-handedly preventing the outbreak
of a nuclear war
the very next day on october 28th
kennedy and khrushchev were able to come
to an agreement
kennedy promised not to invade cuba and
khrushchev removed the soviet missiles
it was the closest the world has ever
come to nuclear war
and it significantly impacted the
outlook of both powers
with a hotline being installed between
the white house and the kremlin
to provide better communication if
another crisis occurred
the next major crisis would occur in
vietnam where the u.s had been
supporting the south in their struggle
against the communist north for almost a
decade
after kennedy's assassination in 1963
his vice president
lyndon b johnson was left to deal with
vietnam
believing america would look weak on the
international stage if he allowed the
south to fall to communism
johnson chose to rapidly increase u.s
military involvement
but the war was deeply unpopular and in
1968 protests would break out across the
western world
the largest would be seen in america
where a politicized youth demonstrated
against a war they thought unjust and
unwinnable
the scale of discontent proved too much
for johnson
who decided not to seek re-election the
war would last for another five years
before the us decided to withdraw
with the communist north then taking
over the south
more than 58 000 americans had died as
well as 250 000
south vietnamese soldiers over a million
north vietnamese soldiers and vietcong
gorillas would also perish
as well as over 2 million civilians from
both the north and the south
and thousands more from laos and
cambodia while containment had worked in
korea
it had proven ineffective in vietnam
by 1964 the soviet union had been going
through several
internal difficulties khrushchev had
been deposed and replaced by leonid
brezhnev
whose reign was marked by nepotism
corruption and economic stagnation
standards of living within the soviet
sphere were deteriorating
and disillusionment was growing with the
brezhnev doctrine suppressing dissidents
throughout the region with military
force
this would lead brezhnev to seek a more
stable soviet american relationship
facing large protests over vietnam and
cambodia
president richard nixon was also looking
to stabilize relations
in late 1969 he began talks with
brezhnev about a strategic arms
limitation treaty
or salt which would freeze the existing
number of intercontinental ballistic
missiles on both sides
it was the beginning of a period of
detente a french term that refers to the
easing of tensions between nations
ditant would lead to a tense but
relatively stable decade
during which both sides would attempt to
control their nuclear arsenals and avoid
proxy conflicts
but it would ultimately prove
unsuccessful
when ronald reagan assumed the
presidency in 1981
the conventional wisdom of how to deal
with the soviet union
was falling apart dayton was not working
in 1977 the soviets had placed ss-20
ballistic missiles in eastern europe
and had invaded afghanistan in 1979
fiery speeches would become a trademark
of reagan with him describing the soviet
union as an evil
empire and declaring that democracy will
leave marxism leninism
on the ash heap of history but reagan's
view on nuclear weapons was clear
he wanted to see a world in which they
did not exist and where nations were
free from the threat of total
annihilation
the only way he saw to achieve this was
to force the soviets into a new arms
race they would lose
pressuring them to accept an arms
reduction agreement
as reagan stated their choice is to
break their backs to keep up
or to agree to reductions this policy
would be called peace
through strength the cornerstone of this
policy was the strategic defense
initiative
or sdi nicknamed star wars by the media
the project aimed at creating a radical
new missile defense system
using lasers and space-based missile
systems that could defend against a
nuclear attack
reagan knew that the soviet union was
lagging far behind in computer
technology
and could never hope to match the
programme leaving them dangerously
exposed
this policy worked as predicted with the
soviets soon forced to negotiate
meeting with the us in a 1985 summit to
discuss the ongoing nuclear arms race
[Music]
but this time reagan would meet with a
new soviet leader
mikhail gorbachev who would prove to be
one of the most important figures of the
entire cold war
facing years of economic stagnation and
growing discontent in eastern europe
gorbachev knew things had to change he
would introduce perestroika or
restructuring to reform the economy
and glasnost or transparency to address
corruption and political unrest
he knew that the arms race was crippling
the soviet economy
and that the only way forward was to
negotiate with the united states
gorbachev would meet with reagan on five
separate occasions between 1985
and 1988 with each meeting building
trust and respect between the two
reagan happily negotiated with such an
open and cooperative soviet leader
with the two signing the intermediate
nuclear forces treaty
on december 8 1987 banning all short and
intermediate range missiles
within three years the treaty had led to
the destruction of over two and a half
thousand
nuclear weapons with each side allowing
access to their nuclear sites to check
compliance it was a momentous agreement
being the first time both sides had
pledged to eliminate an entire class of
nuclear missile
but soon gorbachev's reforms would begin
to unravel the soviet union itself
in december 1988 he would make a speech
to the united nations
vowing to cut the soviet ground force
commitment in eastern europe by half a
million men
signaling that the brezhnev doctrine
would no longer be enforced
realizing that they would not be crushed
by the soviet military
reformers began to emerge across eastern
europe and in 1989
a string of democratic revolutions would
see nearly every communist
government ousted from power on november
9th
the most symbolic monument of the cold
war the berlin wall
would come down and germany itself would
be reunited the following year
the soviet union would collapse in 1991
dissolving into 15 independent states a
surprisingly quick
and bloodless conclusion to the cold war
a conflict which had dominated
international relations
for over 40 years
