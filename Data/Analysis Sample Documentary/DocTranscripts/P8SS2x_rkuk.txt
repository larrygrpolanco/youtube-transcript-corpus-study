emily schindler was always hopeful that
he would reform
that somehow he would come around
she was also a very devoted catholic
because we asked where she didn't
divorce him said no i couldn't i
wouldn't hurt
my parents by divorcing him besides i
love this man
i love this man and while you were not
jealous
no when he will have only one girlfriend
i will be extremely jealous but he has
hundreds
so how could i be jealous about hundred
women
emily's joke the lied hurt feelings
about her marriage
she often argued bitterly with schindler
about his many lovers
schindler's endless pursuit of beautiful
women
never seemed to distract him from the
plight of his workers
they commuted to his factory from the
jewish ghetto
where conditions were abysmal schindler
was well
aware of their misery and learned of the
nazi's plan to liquidate
the ghetto on march 12 1943
oscar schindler told us when we arrived
at work there
that we will not be going back to the
ghetto
that particular evening because the
reason for that is that there is trouble
in the ghetto there is shootings
killings
and a liquidation of the ghetto going on
and we would be better off staying here
until
this is uh over with
the liquidation of tens of thousands of
jews from the krakow ghetto certainly
had a powerful emotional effect on oscar
schindler
who witnessed it he would have seen
beating he would have seen dogs biting
he would have seen officers cruelly
whipping and
screaming and shouting and bludgeoning
every imaginable
form of destruction including mass
shootings
would have taken place at that moment
you know war profiteer can tolerate
an awful lot wartime is difficult time
for
everybody but that may have been the
moment
when it became too much and when he
recognized that something
awful beyond description beyond
recognition beyond articulation was
taking place
and that may be the moment that
changed him those jews who survived that
night were sent off in cattle cars to
death camps
like auschwitz and treblinka it was all
part of what was being called
hitler's final solution
now he knew that there was a
grand strategy to actually
rid europe of these people to treat them
as a virus which would be
totally eradicated
he knew they weren't a virus he knew
that because he knew stern and he knew
those kids he played with
as a child
schindler's jewish workers were sent to
a brutal existence with twelve
thousand others at the slave labor camp
at ploshof
by day they continued their efforts at
schindler's factory
when the work was over they returned to
the desolation of the camp
a place where summary and mass
executions were common
placoff was run by commandant ammangeth
according to survivors of the camp geth
was a monster it was no life
they were waiting for death
he was killing people on random before
they went to work
terrible memories i have when thinking
that
he was coming back through the yard
whistling a happy tune he was content
like a content
animal he loved to see
blood he was training the dogs
how to attack people
it's very hard for me to talk about this
because if
it was terrible he would give out the
order
to the big one to the white rough
and the dog would hop on people
and tear him apart
this was the man with whom schindler ate
and drank
and bonded but the relationship had a
dual purpose
oscar schindler had a plan to get his
jews away
from ammon death
