criticality accidents are a technician's
worst nightmare
although a rare occurrence they can and
do happen
and can result in severe radiological
exposure
and an expensive cleanup process an
event would unfold in the russian
federation in 1997
and would have some similarities to two
of the most
infamous criticality accidents those
being the deaths linked to the demon
core
although not identical the accidental
prompt criticality of some fissile
material due to accidental dropping of a
reflector
does sound familiar to louis slotten's
exposure
the accident would result in a dead very
experienced technician
and a six and a half day excursion
i'm going to rate this event here four
on my painted plane difficult disaster
scale
this is due to the event being
relatively localized and didn't result
in significant contamination
sarov is a city in nishni novgorod
oblast russia
originally founded in 1691 but our story
starts quite a while after that
in 1946 the town became a closed city
and it was removed from all
unclassified maps the reason was well
but it found itself the center of the
soviet nuclear weapons industry the all
union scientific research institute of
experimental physics
was set up in the town which was a
nuclear weapons design facility
the institute over the years had set up
testing grounds
and hundreds of experimental facilities
leading it to become
the country's largest research and
development organization
as a quick side note the city became
twinned with los alamos in the early 90s
post-collapse of the ussr the nuclear
center was still the heartbeat to the
russian nuclear industry
conducting experimental studies in the
fields of physics
radiobiology and the health effects of
radiation
set over 12 facilities one of the
purpose-built facilities was the
critical assembly
which was designed to be an experimental
tool to study fission reactions
relevant for design and development of
power research and impulse reactors
the assembly was placed on a cart on
tracks inside a room
surrounded by concrete walls with a
separate control room
there are also other rooms for storage
and workshops
and each room had air samplers and
detectors for measuring
gamma radiation the critical assembly
was essentially a piece of fissile
material
surrounded by two reflectors although
the actual implementation was a little
more complicated
the assembly had the ability to move the
fissile material
inside a half sphere reflector up and
down
through the use of hydraulic pressure
towards or further away from a fixed
upper half sphere reflector for the
construction of the assembly
thorough calculations are used to ensure
the fissile material remains subcritical
the construction process involves
successive layering of various materials
including copper steel and uranium which
are prepared in the form of sets of
machined
hemispherical shells of standard sizes
which the technician can assemble into
various configurations
the process was broken into two parts
first constructing the lower half of the
critical assembly
then the second top half below half of
the research assembly
is constructed on a table that can move
vertically up and down using hydraulics
for the first part the table had to be
in the up position
during construction of the assembly but
the second part
the lower assembly is lowered and the
upper part is placed on a stand
consisting of a ring
where it can be positioned horizontally
over the lower part of the system
once the whole assembly is constructed
the operator is then meant to go to the
control room to undertake the experiment
also i should say that during the
construction process it's meant to be a
two-person job
the operator and a supervisor who should
be double checking
all of the work during the experiments
the assembly was essentially a small
fast reactor
that can regulate itself in a rather
clever way if the mathematics are
correct
then as the assembly heats up the
materials expand
reducing the effect of the reflectors
and as it cools down
the components return to their previous
position the behavior is seen as
sharp fluctuations of the measured
neutron flux which stabilizes after
several cycles
after which the critical assembly
operates at a constant level of neutron
yield
sensors placed inside the assembly room
tell the operators the state of the
materials
which allows them to move up and down
the lower sphere to change the power
levels
if the assembly went out of control it
would melt thus ending the chain
reaction
and was an important safety feature all
experiments using the assembly were
strictly controlled
via regulatory and technical framework
set out by the russian federation
ministry for atomic energy
the procedures precisely outline the
management requirements for work
with critical assemblies they require
that this type of work be conducted
only by a group of trained technicians
with each person being responsible for
strictly defined actions
within a sequence of operations which
are closely supervised
obviously this is important as a mistake
can result in a criticality event
which you know is not great but we can
probably predict what is going to happen
next
roll on the morning of the 17th of june
1997
a 41 year old male named alexander
zakharov
set to recreate a 1972 experiment using
uranium with a copper reflector assembly
a technician was a very experienced
worker with several hundred experiments
under his belt
he was familiar with the process for the
particular assembly
but contrary to the rules he was working
alone in the hall
zakharov had also broken another rule
and that was by not properly filling out
the appropriate paperwork for the
experiment
he had taken the dimensions for all of
the components from the original 1972
logbook
but he had mistakenly written down the
wrong outside diameter
instead of 205 millimeters he noted 265
millimeters
at 10 50 am whilst placing the upper
reflector on its stand above the fissile
material
it slipped from the technician's rubber
gloved hand and
fell onto the lower part of the assembly
this sent the subcritical assembly
prompt critical and a blue flash of
light
and a heat wave was experienced the
lower part of the assembly was ejected
downwards
into the bottom of the stand knowing his
mistake
zacharov fled the room and reported to
his superiors
explaining the situation he claimed to
have received
more than a fatal dose initially he was
conscious but within minutes his
exposure began to take its effect
the radiation protection personnel
performed an initial radiological survey
of the technician
this detected the neutron induced gamma
radiation emitted by radionuclides
in his body it was estimated that he had
received a whole body dose of 10 grey
for comparison
between 4 and 6 grey whole body dose has
been lethal before
zakharov was sent to hospital for
treatment
arriving at sarav occupational medical
service
at 11 45 in the morning on the 17th of
june
by this time he was experiencing nausea
and he began to vomit
increasing in frequency over the
following two hours
the sickness was lessened by 2pm by
antimetic drugs
the situation was looking pretty dire as
his condition deteriorated
it was decided in the evening that he be
transferred for specialist care in
moscow
he was admitted to the clinical
department of the institute of
biophysics
in the ministry of health at 9pm he was
fully conscious but his fatigue and
headache
were persistent his hands showed signs
of severe exposure
they would become severely swollen
during the first night between the 17th
and the 18th of june
on the morning of the 18th june the
patient's general state was evaluated as
critical
and getting worse by the hour his hand
injuries continued to worsen
with the spreading of the swelling over
more areas of the forearms
on the 19th of june the condition of
zacharov was dire
by 2 pm x-rays showed fluid on the lungs
and his arms were deteriorating rapidly
later on in the day the decision to
amputate both arms was taken
and the surgery was performed around 4
pm initially his condition was stable
but
sadly not for long at 2 45 in the
morning of the 20th of june 1997
his blood pressure dropped dramatically
and at 3 20 in the morning
around 66 hours after exposure the
patient died
but what happened to the critical
assembly after zacharov left the room
and was taken to hospital
as the technician passed away in the
early hours of the 20th of june
the chain reaction would still be
ongoing
back to 10 50 in the morning on the 17th
of june
the specialists arriving at the accident
facility
had to determine the status of the
critical assembly
and the possible consequences of the
accident at 11am
evacuation of all staff from the
building where the accident had occurred
and a radiation survey outside the
building was carried out
by the early afternoon it was confirmed
that there was no airborne or surface
contamination
but the assembly was still emitting
significant neutron and gamma radiation
which would preclude anyone from
entering the room all but the dosameter
furthest away from the experiment showed
readings
off the scale another meter was entered
into the room
and showed the neutron flux was stable
hinting at the chain reaction
being self-regulating obviously the
chain reaction had to be stopped
and this necessitated altering the
assembly remotely
the first step taken was to remove
containers of nuclear materials
which had not been used in the
construction of the assembly this was
conducted by using a robot
once complete the same robot was used to
alter the assembly
at 12 45 in the morning of the 24th of
june 1997
when a vacuum gripper was used to remove
most of the assembly from the sand
leaving only the outermost lower copper
hemis shell
in place the remainder of the assembly
was disassembled bringing an end to the
incident
during the excursion the radiation
monitors in other rooms of the facility
showed normal levels
but a technician's personal dosameter
red
and neutron exposure of 45 grey
and a gamma dose of 3.5 gray
it was thought that the uranium had
reached temperatures
of up to 865 degrees centigrade during
the excursion
because the accident was solely down to
zacharov and his infringement of the
rules set out by the facility
although his death is a tragic accident
some comfort can be taken
that no one else received elevated
radiation doses
although the iaea found the rules of the
facility to be adequate
they still did not prevent the accident
after the accident
experiments with the test rig were
stopped to implement safety upgrades
to the research operations
