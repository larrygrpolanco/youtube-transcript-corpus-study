on May 9 1945 the Japanese Heavy Cruiser
haguro deployed into the Malacca Strait
from Singapore it was to be the ship's
last Voyage a few days later haguro was
ambushed by a fertility of Allied
destroyers who used dozens of torpedoes
and heavy gunfire to sink her over the
course of an hour-long battle where
heguro's crew made their final stand
by the start of May 1945 things were not
looking good for Imperial Japan
in the Pacific the Allied net around
Japan was tightening with intense
fighting on Okinawa while in the Indian
Ocean Rangoon was captured as the Burma
campaign Unwound into a decisive victory
for the United Nations
with Japan on the back foot almost
everywhere its occupied territories
throughout southeast Asia looked more
and more precarious as a result field
martled his saichi charachi the
commander-in-chief of the Southern Army
area began to pull back from some of the
more isolated garrisons from February
1945. as part of a stage program of
evacuations to concentrate Japanese
strength in Malaya and Indochina
by May tarachi was ready to begin
operation show the evacuation of
Japanese troops occupying the Andaman
and nicobar Islands to the north of
Sumatra
to accompany the transports that would
be needed to sail for this task the 10th
area Fleet had only The Heavy Cruiser
huguro and Destroyer Kamikaze available
it was a thoroughly inadequate escort
especially when considering what hagura
was up against
by May 1945 the Royal Navy's East Indies
Fleet had come a long way from the dark
days of 1942 when it had been forced
into headlong retreat in the face of
Japan's fearsome carrier Force even
after a large part of the fleet had been
split off to form the new British
Pacific Fleet the remainder under
Admiral Sir Arthur power was still
formidable in May 1945 there were two
battleships four escort carriers three
Cruisers and eight destroyers available
in the first week of that month Admiral
Powers Fleet had been at Sea supporting
the Allied Advance on rangoon
it returned to Trin commonly in modern
day Sri Lanka on May 9th
but just hours later the fleet was
ordered to raise Steam and prepare to go
to Sea again at first light
Allied intelligence had decrypted
Japanese signals ordering the
cruiserhaguru to put to Sea and head for
Port Blair in the Andaman Islands for
what was the start of operation show
by now Admiral power was away from his
Fleet on a trip to newly recaptured
Rangoon so it fell to his Deputy via
sabriel Harold Walker to tape the fleet
to Sea on the morning of May 10th and
steam eastwards hoping to catch and
Ambush her Guru as it left the andamans
sometime on May 12th

Malacca
haguro and her escort the Destroyer
Kamikaze left Singapore on May 9th and
headed north up the Malacca Strait
the cruiser was skippered by Captain
Kaiju sugira and had his Superior rear
Apple Hashimoto on board
but when Japanese air reconnaissance
spotted a British Fleet on its way East
hagura was ordered back south trying to
avoid an unwinnable confrontation and
hope that the Ally Fleet would
eventually go away
frustrated by the failure of huguro to
steam obligingly into the Trap laid for
her vice admiral Walker took his Fleet
to the Southwest for refueling from the
tanker Echo Dale on May 13th
while he did so the Japanese transport
kuroshoyo Maru slipped through the net
steaming from Penang to nankauri in the
andamans by May 14th encouraged by the
lack of Allied response to this sortie
haguro decided to have another go at the
voyage starting its way North again on
May 14th
by early the following day vice admiral
Walker had committed some of his ships
well to the east in a hunt for the
kuroshoyo Maru which was now on its way
back to Malaya having picked up troops
at Port Blair
the five destroyers of the 26th Attila
under Captain manly power were rattling
along at 27 knots while Avengers
launched from HMS Emperor Street
overhead on the hunt for Japanese
shipping
at around 10 AM three aircrafts spotted
and attacked the ikiroshoyo Maru with
bombers but without success losing two
Avengers in the process
at almost the same time Captain power
aboard HMS salmares received the signal
from the fleet shore-based headquarters
at Colombo ordering his fatilla back to
the South West as with no sign of her
Guru it was believed there was no
Prospect of catching it but Captain
power guessing that whoever had sent the
order would not have known about these
 that had just been attacked by The
Avengers decided to ignore this order
for the time being
he held his ships on the same North
easterly Course while signaling back to
ask for a confirmation to the orders in
light of the reports from the aircraft
whilst waiting at 11 50 power picked up
another report from a second wave of
carrier aircraft identifying one
Japanese Cruiser and one Destroyer south
of the Kuroshio maru's position
the Destroyer soon received permission
to sink enemy ships before returning to
the fleet and set off in Pursuit the
hunt for huguro was on
haguro meanwhile had been warned by the
Japanese outposts on the Northern tip of
Sumatra of the approach of Allied Naval
and Air Forces and was not about to hang
around to find out exactly what kind
the cruiser and her escort swung
background to the South and steamed for
Singapore
the Allied Forces set off in Pursuit
with Captain Powers destroyed 130 miles
from the Enemy by 12 10 pm
they steadily closed the distance while
hagura was occupying with defending of
air attacks by more Avengers through the
afternoon
but as afternoon turned to evening the
Destroyers turned southwards following
her Guru into the Malacca Strait and
rearranging themselves into a single
liner breast keeping a keen eye out for
their powerful opponent
a more than 15 000 tons fully loaded
haguro displaced more than all five of
Captain Powers destroyers combined and
with 10 8-inch and eight 5-inch guns
packed a much bigger punch
she was also a distinguished and
experienced ship having 14 battles
including the Java sea the Battle of
Midway and laity Gulf
in a gun battle at any sort of range in
daylight Powers Destroyer for tiller
would barely stand their chance of
getting close let alone sinking her Guru
but the Japanese Cruiser's Achilles heel
was its speed once able to do 33 knots
years of war service without proper
refill had left her boilers and turbines
ailed and only able to produce around 25
knots slower than the British destroyers
could do
and so the range between the two groups
of ships slowly came down until at 10 40
PM the radar onward HMS Venus detected a
large contact to the northwest
Venus's Bridge crew were initially
skeptical of the contact believing it to
possibly be a cloud but when the
suspected Cloud was seen to sharply
altercourse to the south at 11 32 it was
clear that it was the Japanese warship
they were after
Captain power took his ships further
south to cut her Guru off and then at 12
15 am turned North spreading his ships
into an attack formation with HMS Venus
and verulam as the most advanced ships
on each side
a few miles away steaming South
oblivious to the Trap awaiting them was
the cruiser haguro with the escort in
Kamikaze trailing behind
the Japanese ships were pushing to reach
the safety of Singapore but had been
slowed by the relative inexperience in
these Waters of her Navigator Commander
OTA who required a slower speed to be
certain of avoiding minefields
as a result Hashimoto and Captain sugira
had calculated that any pursuing force
would catch up around 1am if they
maintained the pursuit into the small
hours
despite knowing this according to
Lieutenant Commander is Samo motora the
officer of the watch unaccountably
failed to raise the alarm when Lookout
spotted a line of Destroyers approaching
nine miles away
it was not until 12 50 that the captain
realized what was happening and took
control of the ship by which time the
British destroyers were just 6 000 yards
ahead and closing rapidly
Sakura ordered a hard star but turn and
opened fire on the nearest Destroyer on
the port side which was verilim
the Cruisers swung round but straight
into the teeth of Venus on the opposite
flank
the Destroyer closed to 4 000 yards
lined itself up and then promptly
flunked its torpedo attack by having the
incorrect angle set which would have
meant a certain Miss
unable to launch Venus hauled away
sharply to the West trying to keep
haguro encircled seeing this sugura
assumed the enemy ship had launched
Torpedoes and began another hard turn to
starboard coming back round eventually
to a southerly course and now steaming
straight for the oncoming salmares and
the Vigilant at the center of the
British formation
Kamikaze meanwhile in its attempts to
keep up with huguro's erratic
maneuvering had ended up ahead of its
companion clothing on salmares at a
combined speed of almost 60 knots
Captain power took evasive action and
samares of raped the Destroyer with
anti-aircraft fire as it passed down its
port side
the British ship tried to turn and
Engage The Destroyer but Kamikaze
Slipped Away into the darkness
meanwhile the situation around herguro
was now totally chaotic with the cruiser
being assailed on almost all sides by
hostile ships
at around 2 10 Salman resin verulam made
near simultaneous attack runs on the
North and South East
haguro concentrated its fire on salmares
and blazed away with eight and five inch
shells knocking out one of the
destroyer's boiler rooms just as it was
launching torpedoes
meanwhile at 114 Captain Douglas Bromley
of verulam fired a full soundfo of eight
Torpedoes having been able to approach
without receiving any fire before
setting off to the Northeast the try and
cut off hagura's Escape
the oncoming Torpedoes from a virulum
were spotted on her Guru and an
emergency turn to starboard was ordered
but it was too late and the Turn Only
carried it into the spread fired by
salmares three hits were observed
probably from a combination of salmares
and verilim's torpedoes a large fire
began the taguro stern its speed dropped
and the cruiser began to list rapidly
as captain segura's ship founded it came
under Fire from all directions as the
British fatilla came in to finish her
off
rear Admiral Hashimoto ordered Kamikaze
to save itself with a retreat to Penang
shortly before a British shell
demolished haguro's Bridge killing
almost everyone there
a 124 HMS Venus began her second attempt
at attacking haguro with a salvo of six
Torpedoes launched from the north
three minutes later on the opposite side
of the stricken Cruiser Virago followed
suit launching seven torpedoes
with Torpedoes flying all over the place
the British were extremely lucky not to
hit each other twice during the battle
Venus's crew reported hearing the sound
of torpedoes passing right by the ship
hakuro was not so lucky three more hits
were scored on the cruiser which by now
was stationary listing over dramatically
but still afloat and still with her guns
blazing away even with most of these
senior officers on board dead or wounded
31 Torpedoes have now been fired and
still her guro refused to go down so the
British ships came in again
a 150 HMS Vigilant 5 8 more Torpedoes
followed by a final attack from Venus
with her last two at least two more hits
were observed and herguro finally began
to sink
a 206 Venus signaled Captain power of
the enemy Cruiser had been sunk and the
British fatilla began to retire to the
north having sustained only minor damage
and the loss of two men aboard salmares
the day after the battle Kamikaze
returned to the sights of figuro's
sinking where it found hundreds of
sailors clinging to wreckage and
lifeboats 320 were able to be rescued
with another 751 lost with the ship
including Captain Segura and rear apron
Hashimoto
the sinking of haguro in the Malacca
Strait was the last gun battle between
major surface warships of the second
world war and it underlined the degree
to which the Allied Powers had taken
total control of the sea it was a
control they used to squeeze Japan into
eventual submission three months later
