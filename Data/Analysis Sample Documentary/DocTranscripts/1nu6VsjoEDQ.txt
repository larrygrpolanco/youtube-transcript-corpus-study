paper was light gold in medieval times
i want tobacco sugar
that everything we thought we knew about
the world
might turn out to be completely wrong
[Music]
scenarios in my head played out over and
over again of me snapping someone's neck
punching them i was really convinced i
was a really bad person i had no
understanding of what was going on in my
mind
every 10 seconds i had an intrusive
thought popping into my head
and it went on for months i thought it
would go away it's just a thing
it didn't go away
i'm alison and i've had puro and ocd for
16 years
a lot of the things that i think about
are violent so i'll think about
shouting things out hitting someone
pushing him downstairs
i'll be sitting in the passenger side of
my mum's driving and i can see
my hand on the steering wheel and i can
see myself steering the car into
oncoming traffic
and it's like it's almost already done
i have a funny kind of experience with
unwanted thoughts because at first when
i didn't know
what intrusive thoughts were i thought
they were terrible i thought they were
absolutely terrible
well i don't really want to push my mom
down the stairs like
a part of me is so sure that that's what
needs to happen and that i'm going to do
it
a lot of people would be shocked with
the way that i sometimes talk to my mum
i'll say to her i really want to push
you downstairs i really want to hit you
i really want to snap your neck and
she's like oh that's interesting oh
that's good
oh that's okay cool nice anyway what's
for dinner what are you cooking
i know she's really tired of it
sometimes she'll play along
these thoughts are what we call
inconsistent with their values
and therefore they are ridiculous and
absurd
to the individual and therefore they do
not get any gratification from them or
pleasure they're extremely distressing
to the individual
and they're spending their life trying
to get rid of them or control them
everyone has intrusive thoughts most
people
when waiting for a train might have
thought what happens if i stepped out in
front of it
someone might be cutting something up
with their kitchen knife and they might
suddenly realize
it would actually be incredibly easy to
just stab
someone with this a person with pure oak
might dwell on that thought more than
average
they might be concerned that says
something about them
you'll have a thought you'll go over it
and over and over and over it
it could be absolutely anything and it
is just thinking
but thinking constantly and at that pace
it makes you exhausted
pure o is a term used by sufferers to
describe
symptoms of obsessive-compulsive
disorder where people experience
intrusive thoughts images urges doubts
inside their mind
which are extremely distressing or
common obsessional thoughts and worries
might be around
sex and violence or religious themes so
for example in a sexual obsessions it
might be the fear that you're a
pedophile when you're
not you're gonna push people in front of
the train
my name is kirk stacy i am a
self-employed illustrator
ocd likes different themes to torture
its host
with with the religious stuff you get a
lot of guilt don't say this don't go
there don't do that
if i thought of a joke and laughed oh
that's rude you can't say that
you have to say sorry to god otherwise
he will punish you
so i was a religious person even though
i wasn't religious
i think the images were just a flicker
of a force
it was a person named white gang there
was another one with the crucifix
there was another one image of the pope
or christ they flash
bang it's there and it's out it's like
life goes in and it comes out
you've got this overwhelming anxiety and
also
guilt you feel guilty for having these
thoughts that you cannot control
i felt that that was the torture i
deserve
for having a fault in the first place so
you're trapped in this cycle
the point being it's not your fault and
there are lots of things that then
shape you during childhood and
adolescence but there is only always
various
triggers or things that are associated
with the onset not always but
quite often my name is nathan i'm 24 and
i'm from hertfordshire
i think what happened when i was about
11 my nan died
i became so worried that i would lose my
mum i had these obsessive thoughts about
her dying
and i remember i would just constantly
ask her if she was okay
she got really irritated because i was
just asking that too much
nobody wants to be asked the same
question again and again and again
the thought of my mum dying terrified me
so i had no understanding of what was
going on in my mind
i eventually began to realize that there
was something a bit weird about the way
i was thinking
obviously at the time that i never knew
ocd was i didn't associate that with ocd
that's only something that i've recently
realised it was there at quite a young
age been there a lot longer than i
thought it was
[Music]
my history goes back 25 years the
trigger for me
secondary school it's my myself and a
few friends who went to local news
agents get some snacks
and i saw one of my friends as he walked
in
grabbed some pick and mix and shoved it
in his pocket and i thought that's how
easy it is while i'll have a crack and i
can show off to my friends
as i came out hey guys look look what
i've got
the store detective was walking in the
shop and she she heard it
did you steal those i was much in the
shop and i think said well
this is really bad the police are going
to go to your house have a word with
your parents
they may have to go to your school you
just weighed on me with all these
threats
and i thought then my mates have
probably used to spread it like wildfire
as a result i became kind of scorphobic
more they tried to push you against that
fear
the more it affects you it's really
really a sad time that one incident
could create such a traumatic effect
the area i live in super quiet nothing
happens but
i just feel like someone's gonna jump
out
everyone is a danger everyone is violent
everyone could kill me i might hurt
somebody else if they attack me that's
kind of my big thing at the moment
is that every second i'm calculating
what's a weapon
that i can use to protect myself with i
last left the house
christmas eve so from christmas eve
until
12th of january but it's not felt
strange it's just felt safe
i really hate the beginning of the year
because i think well it's another year
that i've not
changed or i've not progressed other
people are doing it
so why am i still here struggling
yeah the first time seeing my gp i said
you know i thought i was going blind and
then for some reason i convinced myself
i
was developing schizophrenia which my
uncle has schizophrenia so a kind of
genuine worry if you
if you will like if that didn't pluck
itself out of nowhere like i had
a reason there was kind of some
substance i guess to that
obsession i literally would just stay in
the bed for the whole
with the laptop for two weeks there's no
use
trying my parents would try and get me
up and things
i just kind of have to be left alone
like i there's no i'm not gonna
i'm not gonna be able to function you
just kind of have to leave me but they
were just worried
they were kind of realizing there was
something something wrong
what healthy people without ocd
experience are exactly the same
content as the intrusive thoughts that
occur in ocd the content is the same
but the problem with pure is the meaning
that you're attached to them
perhaps thinking these things means that
i might act upon them or that i'm
immoral for having these thoughts or the
way that you respond to them
control them avoid them or suppress them
all these things
feed the obsession 2003
i had a really bad ear infection it just
felt like someone was
sticking a red-hot needle in there i was
diagnosed with
a clochestioma which is like a tumor
and inside it destroys the inside of the
ear and
left untreated it can invade the brain
and cause meningitis that kind of stuff
and they arranged an operation but we
have to be careful
not to hit the facial nerve otherwise
the side your face would drop
i thought well i'll put the operation on
hold because i didn't like the idea of
going into hospital
and being knocked out
[Music]
and that became a silly little fear and
it grew you're dead you're a dead man
the club chastity human now has spread
to the other ear
it's taken my hearing down i've got
white noise in both ears
when it gets near the point of you know
your operations next week
i knew it would be the death of me
because i would not be able to
surpass it or overcome it coach behavior
therapy includes exposure and ritual
prevention
in other words it's about trying to test
out your fears
developing a different relationship your
thoughts that these are just your own
inner world and you cannot control them
you allow the thoughts to be there but
you can't you don't necessarily have the
exact same reaction
so you end up pulling it apart and
figuring out a way of discerning what
are
authentic concerns versus what's done
by ocd combined with the medication
that's how
i get through the day gets through life
my first encounter with cbt was on the
nhs it was in
a basement of a four-story building
i used to look up the building
regulations of any building that i went
into
i would check out their fire stuff like
when the last time they had a fire check
was like when last time that the gas
person was there
it was in the basement this room was
tiny it had no windows
i couldn't help but feel like there
wasn't enough air in there for the both
of us
he had a shirt that didn't fit that
bothered me his hair was not combed
that bothered me he was like really
red-faced there are far too many things
for me to think about to actually
credit that person that was front of me
i i had no respect for him whatsoever
there's a possibility that i wasn't
really ready to listen to anything that
i felt
was wrong that how i was living wasn't
great for me
and so i feel like i deflected a lot of
my anger
and the way that i was really feeling
about my situation onto that person
erp which stands for exposure response
prevention
it's about exposing yourself to that
which you fear
so say you were completely avoiding
knives you didn't even want to see one
you might go towards starting to use the
knife for its intended purpose
perhaps using the knife around other
people by
exposing themselves to the very
uncomfortable anxiety
you don't stay in that state of high
anxiety forever it will eventually
start to go down
so the last time i had gone to a e by
myself that was when i was convinced i
was both a psychopath and
i think a narcissist and it's just the
process of having to
going up to that desk and then tell the
person what's going on with you
and then you go and see somebody and
there's nothing they can do
their only concern is to work out
whether or not you're either a danger to
yourself or to the public
and if you're not and they then they
send you off on your own as well which
is a really quite horrible experience
i kind of feel like they should have
specific sections in
in in a e departments for mental health
issues which i'm sure they probably do
at some hospitals
but never one that i've been to many
people it can be cured for some people
it can only be
managed and for some people it's a
struggle when i had
purero mine was incredibly severe i
couldn't do
anything else and it was incredibly
scary it still
does occasionally pop up but it doesn't
make me afraid in fact it really has
no effect whatsoever so it will pop up
and then maybe i won't have it anymore
for the next couple of days
there's always been this big debate
whether you cure
or you manage it depends
what you consider to be cured
i'm a complete knight yeah i don't know
if i'm hopeful i just get on with life
i have all these things i want to get
done with my life
i think hope is a waste kind of wasted
energy
you know i just take things as they can
it's not going to go anywhere i don't
think i think it's too
embedded in my personality not my
personality but my
brain whatever i don't think it's going
to go away
when i look back at the old me i feel
sorry for that person who was in the
bubble
you have to convince part of your brain
that you can beat this thing it's about
exposure i have to expose myself to the
spikes in anxiety expose myself to the
intrusive thoughts and live
anyway live through them not around them
which i'm really good
at doing you can create a structure
where
you can survive it i'm happy that i'm
actually creating an artwork and selling
it and i'm taking commissions
i'm happy now if you want to change
something you have to actually
actively make changes to be too afraid
to make the changes
it's just accepting that where you are
now is perfectly fine for you which is
not
so i have to do stuff like walk around
the block understanding that someone
isn't going to jump out from the bushes
and try and attack me
if you do something enough and you sort
of like retrain your brain
then you should really like rewrite like
your neural pathways
basically i should be able to rewrite
the story in my head
