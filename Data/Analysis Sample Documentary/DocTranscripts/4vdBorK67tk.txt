Hello
My name is Aurora
And I'm a musician from Norway
I'm making this video because I'm afraid of what might happen
I might not be here tomorrow or the day after
So I want to make this video to keep the things that inspire me alive
Hello?
Yeah are you here?
Growing up in Bergin has been like the most beautiful gift I can ever get
I learned that you can create this whole world
by yourself
I guess you have the space to do it and that's so important
I've had a really special childhood with lots of magical happenings
And imagination above all
Apples are so magical
I believe every one has a secret wish hidden in them
And you have to wish it after taking a bite
The wonderful thing with making music with yourself is kind of
A way to stop time just in the moment
As I sit down and then you just play
I started writing melodies when I was 6 years old
And then the words came when I was 9
And after I discovered all of my greatest weapons in life, words
I never stopped
Music is not something you should keep from yourself
It can't be put in a cage
Because it's wild and alive
I have 2 sisters and they're both amazing creatures
Miranda.
That's me
And Victoria in the middle
Make-up artist and designer and me
Uh, yeah the first time I heard you sing was when you got that present from your friend
It was like uh a studio.
A session in the studio.
Yeah
You recorded one song.
And I don't think she knew how well she did
She was like oh, is this nice?
I was like Aurora what?
It's beautiful
We were always no eh worried about you
That you were gonna get bullied or picked on
Because you were so weird and you dressed so weird yeah
And we were so scared that it was going to be uh so tough on you
To go high school or one of these things
You were like no it's fine
But everybody loved you
These are some of my very very good friends
And I don't think I would've had so much fun in high school without them
I remember when I first met you I was like oh my g-d this girl is magic
I think we look very different then first impressions
Yeah hahaha
Let love conquer your mind
Going up?
Roria-roria.
A la tula.
Yeah.
And then lower es?
Even though you have so many fans and people say they love you
And have never met you it's really important to also have friends who
Actually know you and yeah know you as you not the artist
But we know you as you I know you as you
Let love conquer your mind
Warrior.
Warrior.
Just reach out for the light
Warrior.
Warrior.
I am high
This is Ivan.
She is one of the only people who knew me from when I was 6 years old
But also knows how it is being a bit more than just being a normal teenager I guess
I only think you've changed in that sense of course everyone changes
But I think the essence of you is still the same
And it just feels like you've grown into yourself
And just kind of figured out who you are
Do you feel like you're relaxed when you come
home or do you feel like you're constantly
Working?
Well I have ants in my feet that wants me
to go to the studio if I have a day off
Because I guess I feel like I have an opportunity
to make something new
You do a take and it's pitch perfect and you say no that wasn't really good
And we have to like yeah it was good
Like nah do it over again and we like ugh c'mon
You always seem to dance on the chairs
And now we have like 5 broken chairs in the studio
Which is really annoying
You're always moving in the studio though
Unless you're in like London or Berlin or
New York or LA somewhere cool
Not raining
I didn't travel much to big cities before
I was signed by my management
So music has basically taking me everywhere
The first time I went to a big city was a
Strange feeling of being in an ocean not really
knowing how to breathe or move
It was very inspiring as well because it was
a very different world
From the world I know
Do you believe in magic?
Yeah
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
He holds the gun against my head
I close my eyes and bang I'm dead
I know he knows that he's killing me for mercy
He holds my body in his arms
He didn't mean to do no harm
And he cries and cries
He did it all to spare me from the awful things in life that come
And he cries and cries
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
The gun is gone and so am I
And here I go
I used to come to this island very often when I was a child
It's quite strange how nothing can remind
me more of how things have changed
It used to be a childhood place because everything
is the same
The trees and the smell and the silence but
the only thing that's different is
You and the way you see things and the way
you think
And just like in fiction and in every addiction
Of fantasies taking over and wake me
The more I travel around and live and the
more people I meet
You realize how nothing is eternal
Nothing to me
I thought I should make this video so my voice
could keep talking after I'm gone
About things that I think is important to remember
And the lovely people I met
And things I like
And places I find to be the most beautiful
So those things will be remembered
I've been looking for the only one
But you don't seem to come
My way
I feel ali-li-live
I feel ali-li-live
I feel ali-li-live
I feel ali-li-live
