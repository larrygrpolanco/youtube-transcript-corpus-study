the countryside of the northeastern
congo
is beautiful and the soil is rich and
fertile
and yet the people here live in poverty
and constant fear of attack by armed
militias
over 120 such groups have been operating
for more than two decades
on the territory of the democratic
republic of the congo
along its northern borders to south
sudan uganda
and rwanda neither the government nor
tens of thousands of u.n peacekeepers
have been able to stop them and the
people suffering
inevitably leads to more suffering as
victims join one rebel group or the
other
they killed my father they killed
everyone in my family
that's the only reason i became a
fighter
a woman grieves for her murdered child
an all-too-common sight in the
northeastern congo
the militias killed around 2000 people
here in 2020 alone
the worst of them called themselves the
allied democratic forces or adf
they're islamist rebels who've been
terrorizing the local population for
some
30 years
they kill people with bullets they kill
people with machetes
they killed my brother with machetes
the islamists attack every few days
often under cover of darkness
they leave devastation behind burned out
houses and beheaded corpses
the local people feel like the congolese
army and the u.n peacekeepers have
abandoned them
we joined up with a u.n patrol in benny
one of the trouble spots
attacks by the adf on the civilian
population here
have been on the increase in recent
months
the u.n patrol checks up on a clinic in
maemoa
it's been a frequent target of adf
attacks
imbusaki wuhua is the clinic's director
the militia comes here and massacres
people if you saw the sheer hatred that
drives the killing
they chop heads off and you find the
brains all around
and chopped off feet that leaves you
terrified
and traumatized
once the islamists tried to abduct four
of his nurses
they took them hostage in the waiting
area when the people there realized it
was the adf
they were scared but then the militia
said nobody would die
it wasn't a day for killing
many in the area live in fear u.n
soldier bosisiwa isaacs knows the clinic
and the people who work there very well
as you can see other nurses cannot
really wear their nursing uniform
because when they are attached and
identified they are the ones that are
targeted to be killed first
hence when they come to work they have
to dress like everybody else
the constant threat level keeps the
clinic closed all but a few hours a day
many patients are left without treatment
they struggle with food they cannot go
and plow they cannot go and farm
they have to stay at home they cannot
move the children cannot go to school
so far the u.n force has failed to
establish and maintain security
often enough the more than 18 000 troops
from nearly 50 nations
can hardly even get themselves
coordinated many of them are
inadequately trained or at least
not trained with the relevant skills the
local villagers aggravate the problems
with often
unjust accusations that the u.n troops
are a pack of thieves
only concerned with their own safety
many of the congolese no longer put
any hopes in the u.n troops at all
and the local people too often find
themselves caught between fronts when
their daughters and sons
actually join the adf so the parents end
up cooperating with the rebels
supplying them food for example in
return they're left in peace
but if they refuse they may be killed
sometimes we're content sometimes we're
afraid
the militias can show up anytime they've
become part of our daily lives
most of the local people are afraid to
appear before the camera
one man who didn't want to say his name
gives vent to his frustration
the government should help or the
international community should help our
government with this situation
so many people have suffered the adf's
got to be finished
in the meantime the adf keeps on
murdering
as soon as the camera's off many people
here say the soldiers come too late
only once the attack's over and people
are already dead
we meet jaribu muliwavio a local
representative who's been studying the
adf for years
in his view the u.n mission has not
achieved its goals
the communities here really ought to be
secured according to my research as many
as 4
500 people have been killed right under
the un forces noses
and what's their job again to protect
the civilian population
but more are getting killed every day
the adf was founded as an islamist group
in uganda in the early 1990s
experts have estimated their current
strength at a few hundred fighters
they're seen as exceptionally cruel and
intent on establishing
islamic sharia law in the territory they
control
they want to create a space a grey area
where the state has no authority
they intend to control this area and
exploit it
it's what they call the islamic state of
central africa
the caliphate of central africa they've
already set it up
to them this state is already up and
running
in march 2021 the united states
designated the adf
a terrorist organization with ties to
the islamic state
but some observers doubt the two groups
maintain any direct contact
besides the adf over 120 other militias
are active in the eastern congo
after the 1994 genocide in neighboring
rwanda
some hutu militias fled to the congo and
kept on killing
that prompted the formation of armed
groups originally
for purposes of self-defense they do not
make it easy to contact them
to do so we had to leave the area under
central government control
halfway there militia fighters meet up
to lead us to one of their bases
among them is mama faida she joined the
militia about 20 years ago
after an armed group massacred her
family she was forced to watch as the
men killed her parents with machetes
then six of the men raped her she was
only 15 years old at the time
i felt defeated
[Music]
so i decided to become a fighter and
drive them out
when a former teacher came to her
village to recruit young people for a
new militia
she joined him many of its members have
experienced
similar horrors it is in essence a
militia of traumatized and emotionally
scarred people
they killed my father they killed
everyone in my family
that's the only reason i became a
fighter
her own community cast her out because
she'd been raped
too great was the stigma the militia
offered her a chance to take revenge
and to survive they control around 20
villages in the region
protecting the inhabitants who in return
keep them supplied with food
it's a simple trade security for food
but we got the impression it wasn't
always a voluntary arrangement
mama faida didn't speak openly until we
moved some distance from the others
heard that others are fleeing the group
but how could i run away i have nobody
to help me
i don't own any land i don't have anyone
who could help me build a new life
now she places all her hopes on her
children her hope that one day
they'll have a choice
with the blessings of god i might at
least arrange for them to get an
education
if they are blessed at least that
i myself will never be able to do any
other job
i can't help them by myself
[Music]
hardly any other region has suffered
atrocities by the militias
as badly as the congo's ituri province
we go on the road with the norwegian aid
organization
over a distance of just 60 kilometers we
pass through about 20 checkpoints of
various rebel groups
as well as the congolese military
by the side of the road a few are
carrying guns though concealing them
often they ask for money as they are
doing here
but a few words convince them to wait
for another day
is a camp for internally displaced
people
it's one of many in the congo about five
and a half million
of the country's 105 million people are
displaced
more than anywhere else in africa logo
gioro barely escaped her village when a
militia attacked it
she was on the run with her children
when she realized her daughter was
missing
i decided to go back to find and save
her i was convinced she was still
alive but unfortunately she was already
dead
i was so sad just devastated
when i walked past them they shot at me
i had no idea if i'd survive
i gradually lost all my strength i
heaved and was breathing harder and
harder
then i slipped into some bush i didn't
really have any hope anymore
i was sure i was going to die
she survived but her four-year-old
daughter was murdered
as soon as the hospital released her she
gathered her other five children
and fled to this camp
even if food water and medical care are
in short supply
at least they are safe here
many people here have stories like logo
joros to tell
they live in desperation and resignation
the trauma runs deep
and like logo joro although they don't
have the money to send them to school
they still put their hope in their
children and so another generation
is growing up without education as easy
potential recruits
for the militias
[Music]
