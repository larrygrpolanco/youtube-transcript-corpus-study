(frantic screaming)
(horn honking)
- What, what!
- I love this movie. I love this movie.
- Welcome to the club pal.
- Wanna see it.
(laughter)
That's great.
- Ah, The Fast and The Furious movies
we all love the franchise
but technically they're not very good.
What if I told you that
there's an entire genre
of knockoff Fast and Furious
movies that make The Fast
and The Furious look like
The (beep) Godfather.
But the best of the best of the worst
of them all might be the movie
we're talking about today.
200 miles per hour, the
story of a young man
on a quest to avenge his brother's death.
The only way that he knows how
by going 200 miles per hour.
Today, we're gonna look at
some of the most moving,
well acted in action pack scenes
from this absolute Goliath of cinema.
I'm James. He's Justin. This is Nolan.
Let's go 200 miles per hour.
- Thanks to eBay motors

(playful music)
- Justin's seen it a cool dozen times.
I've seen it once and Nolan
has seen it never times.
I mean just the specifics alone all right.
It's written by a guy named Thunder Levin.
So if you're an initial D fan, you know
that literally translates to
- yeah, wait a minute.
- His name's Thunder Lightning.
He also wrote Sharknado and
it was directed by this guy.
So Nolan, are you ready
to experience 200 miles
per hour for the first time?
- I forgot that that's
what we're doing today.
So yes.
- Excellent. The movie kicks
off with our protagonist,
Rick, who is an amateur
racer working on his FC RX7.
His brother, Tommy, pulls
up in a brand new 370Z.
If you watched our video,
real mechanics react
to bad car lines, then you
might recognize this scene.
(crickets chirping)
- It's like an $80,000 car.
- No it's not!
- 0 to 60 in three and a half seconds.
- No.
- Quarter mile 11.5 seconds.
- No.
- And 193 miles per hour top speed.
(laughter)
Yeah. And it's not
gonna be stock for long.
- He's like yeah and
it's not gonna be stock.
- It's not stock but it's already modded.
Those aren't OEM stickers.
- Yeah. So this is 370Z.
- Yeah.
- You got a decent one for
like what? 12 15 grand.
- I love the vanity license plate too.
Ohh fa sho.
- That's possibly the
best vanity license plate
I've ever seen in my life.
- And very fitting for a 370Z.
- I am legitimately jealous
of that license plate.
- It's pretty good. Yeah.
- Oh fa sho.
- Oh fa sho.
- So yeah. We're two
minutes into the movie.
So far zero facts about cars are correct.
The brothers then head up to
the Sepulveda suicide race.
And at the Sepulveda suicide race,
they meet up with their crew,
including Claudia, Rick's girlfriend.
- Okay.
- And Kelly, the magical mechanic.
- Well?
- You've been messing
with my timing again.
Haven't you?
- It is my car.
- There. I fixed it
(laughter)
- Dude.
- She's like, alright.
- One. She can tell that the timing is off
by looking at a car that is off.
- That's awesome.
- And then she touches it like this.
- Yep. Boop.
- There I fixed it.
- Click.
- And then the bad guy shows up.
Kayce in his Nissan GT-R.
- Ooh.
- Kayce got his older
brother, Tommy, into racing
for pink slips.
- Oh, I think I
- Rick is like, "No dude
what are you doing?"
- Okay
- His brother like grabs
him by the back of the neck.
And he goes, "Hey you're
gonna be the first one to
go to college. I like that.
Mom likes that. I got this."
He's got that like Ryan Gosling like,
"Hey, you wanna go for a
drive? You want a tooth pick?"
(roaring car engine)
(tires squealing)
- Definitely speed ramp.
- Oh no!
(metal crushing)
Oh, oh no. Not the 350.
(Laughter)
- That's one of my favorite parts.
- That's my favorite part.
- Tommy!
- The whole crowd just teleports.
- Yeah. They're like a mile away.
- Dude is trucking.
And I wonder how many
takes they got out of him
before he was like,
(heavy panting)
like the entire plot of the
movie depends on the idea
that Kayce killed Tommy in this race.
- Yeah yeah yeah.
- Let's let's watch the tape back
- Let's analyze this.
(roaring car engine)
(tires squealing)
- No, Tommy just sucks driving.
- Tommy just sucks a driving.
(metal crashing)
(laughter)
The sound mixing is pretty
- Now the 370 is magically a 350.
- Oh.
- You know, what's hilarious
though, the first time he
turns right he rolls the car.
- He should be in NASCAR.
So at this point I'm like, alright
Kayce's not that bad of a
guy, but then he does prove
that he is like a real,
like, kind of crappy dude
because he shows up at Tommy's funeral.
- Bold.
- Yeah. And demands that
Rick give him his card.
- Whoa!
- Because he was racing for pinks.
And if he can't have Tommy's car
then he needs to have Rick's car.
They decide to race.
- Okay.
- Now back to the garage and
Kelly lays out her plans.
- Take a look at this.
I made some sketches.
- Oh nice.
(laugher)
- That's the Pumphrey 502.
- Oh nice.
But like, I also want to call
out all the eraser marks.
- They just had someone
set like draw a car.
- I bet the director drew it.
- You know what? This just might work.
- That's gonna be awesome.
- Okay.
- They've said that four times.
- I think this is a good time to call out.
There's a theme in this movie
that for some reason, the biggest fear
of going fast in these cars is
that it will lift off
the ground and fly away.
- I love it.
- Maybe 10 times in this movie they
bring up the concern
of the car flying away.
You're not worried about
popping the engine.
They're not worried about, you know
anything other than the car flying away.
- Yeah.
- Kelly's sketches are approved
and now it looks like this.
(upbeat music)
That is sick.
- That is sick.
- Okay. It's green now.
- I love it.
- Hey. You don't think I'm
letting you take my baby
out without me. Do you?
- So now it's green, right?
Totally understandable.
- Yep.
- It's gotta spoiler on it. That's cool.
- Yeah.
- Time for a first test drive.
- Let's do it.
- All right I want to know
if you notice anything
about the car.
- All right. I'll pay attention.
(engine roaring)
(tires squealing)
Oh, it's a Nissan now.
- Apparently during filming
the RX-7 was stolen.
- What?
- Yes. So that was on
set in a trailer with a
truck attached to said
trailer all belonged to
Justin Pawlak, the former drift driver.
- Whoa.
- And it all disappeared.
- Hi Justin.
- Whoa, that sucks.
- Yeah.
- So you know when I originally
saw this movie, I was like,
It was so hilarious that
they just went out of
their way to build a lookalike car.
But that's what happened
- That's wild, man.
- Rick goes to see his girlfriend.
She's very upset that he's racing.
So he leaves there comes
back to the garage.
He's like, yo, I gotta
go test the car again.
- Let's see what happens.
(engine roaring)
Oh no. It's the cops
- Oh. Oh. Flying real low.
- Just wait.
- Son of a (beep).
(laughter)
- Whoa.
- The effects are amazing.
- I love this movie. I love this movie.
- Welcome to the club now.
- I wanna see it. That's great.
- I just wanna mention that we're only
30 minutes into this 90 minute.
Yes. So they try and out run the cops.
- Somehow they avoid that
stunt driving helicopter.
- Yeah. They avoid the helicopter.
Helicopter's gone parked in a parking lot
and in broad daylight.
The cop catches them.
- You, on your knees! Elbows in the air.
Don't you (beep) move.
- What do you mean elbows in the air?
- Is this really necessary?
- Is that a message from Kayce?
- No.
- No.
- That's a message from me.
The man who has your balls in his hand.
- Again underwrite the techno babble
overwrite the tough guy.
- The balls in his hand.
- I think that was ad lib.
So the cop demands that Rick
like forfeit the race to Kayce.
Because if you haven't noticed,
he's a bit of a crooked cop.
They head back to the garage,
meet up with the crew.
But wait a sec, did they
hit 200 miles per hour
in the helicopter chase?
- 160 miles per hour.
- 160.
- Wow.
- Son of a (beep). I
can't believe we did it.
- They made that up.
- I love that.
- Those guys were rehearsing lines
and they made (beep) that up.
I love that.
Yeah. Those guys are having fun with it.
- Do I know my ground effects or what?
- Do I know my ground effects or what.
She attributed to the top
speed to the body kit.
- How are we gonna make it any faster?
We've done every mod made for it.
- We could use nitrous.
- Nobody makes a NOS system for the MX-5.
And there's a reason for it.
- MX-5. See again, I think
this was written for Miata.
And then they found a way cooler,
in my opinion, car to be the hero.
- Or they thought it was
a Miata the whole time.
- Yeah. Maybe they
thought this was a Miata.
They track down the only guy
in LA to ever run nitrous on an MX-5.
And Rick goes and pays him a visit.
- I saw the Speedo hit 180
but I really wasn't sure because
the car was shaking so bad.
The front end began to lift up.
- He sounds like he's given a testimony
- Flipped (beep) over end
right through a second story window.
I was wearing a four point safety harness
and that thing came apart.
I flew out the car window,
landed in a pile of (beep).
- What?
- Going 140 hits the switch
car literally takes off.
But then, but goes (beep) over end.
- He falls out.
- Some point his four
point harness breaks.
He goes out the window.
This is a now in a house.
He falls into a pile of (beep).
Domingo's like, yo you
can have my kit for free
if it helps you beat Kayce.
Because if Kayce's outta the
game, that's more money for me.
Then something messed up happens.
- Oh.
- Kayce follows Claudia,
Rick's now ex-girlfriend.
So it is a 12 minute scene of
this guy following this woman.
It's a lot of time to spend
on something like that.
What are you doing Thunder Levin?
She runs out.
Rick picks her up.
Oh, I also wanna point
out the nitrous button
is the windshield wiper
switch in the RX-7.
So he hits the nitrous
to get away from Kayce.
(engines roaring)
- In his 240
- Get that alignment checked on.
- Oh look 160 dude.
Ah, look at his speedometer.
His speedometer got a label maker over it.
It says MPH.
That is a thermometer.
- That's a air pressure gage.
- It's air pressure gage.
Art department's like I found hack.
They just turned the
compressor to 160 pounds.
Okay. So again, he just
saved his girlfriend
from being taken and he's
stoked about going 160.
- Yeah. He's in the middle of the
- It works we're not taking off.
- Take this piece of (beep).
- It works we're not taking off.
We're not flying in my car.
Even at 160. We're not flying.
So they're still moving now.
But then wait till we cut to the wide.
- (beep) you.
- Definitely moving.
- Oh my God.
- Rick!
(cars crashing)
- That's why his bumper's all messed up.
He's doing that to himself
(frantic screaming)
(horn honking)
- What? What?
- Well, he just lost his car.
- Oh, I didn't think about that.
- He lost his car. He's fine.
So he goes back to the
crew and they're like
we got a crazy idea.
Remember that 370-Z that
got rolled 27,000 times
that your brother died in?
We're gonna go steal it
from the police impound.
And you're gonna race that.
- All right.
That's a hair brand idea if
I've ever heard one. I'm in.
- It seems is impossible but Kelly,
she says she can do anything.
She rebuild the car in two days,
which you know is totally possible.
- Just go down to the dealer.
They'll give you parts.
- All right.
So the car's fixed. Ready to rock.
They line up for the final race.
- Let's go.
(tires squealing)
(car crashing)
- Oh no, my light pole.
- He's a good guy.
- Kayce!
- Kayce!
- Kayce!
- They don't show any wreckage.
It's not the budget.
- Think about this.
You can't shoot him.
They'll know it was a gun.
- He's got a point.
He's got a point.
- He's got a point
- But this next move he does is legendary.
- They have the technology.
- You're right. I can't. You can.
- Where'd that gun come from?
And it's already taped up.
- One, Two,
- Hey, Flynn.
- And the crowd teleports again.
- She's a genie.
- She's a genie.
- She has magical power. She can teleport.
She can fix things with
a touch of her hand.
So then what happens?
- Rick realizes that racing won't
bring his brother back then.
Domingo Juarez shows up.
- Domingo Juarez.
- Remember he landed in the (beep).
Domingo offers Kelly a
job on a NASCAR team.
She says, she'll think about it.
And then he pays Rick a
hundred thousand dollars
for the 170.
- Because it has historical value.
- Right.
- That's great.
- Yeah. And now Rick can go
to college and that's 200 miles per hour.
