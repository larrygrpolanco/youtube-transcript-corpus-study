welcome to Pakistan to the transgender
community in a conservative Muslim
country
the problem is that if you kill a dog on
this side and on the other side you kill
a transgender person the transgender
person has no value but the dog does
[Music]
sometimes I feel depressed sometimes I
feel empowered that yes I am somebody
sometimes I feel I have to fight back
[Music]
when I was born to my parents they named
me Muhammad assim Sharif but I never
associated with this name
I always imagined myself in the clothes
of a woman but my parents gave me the
clothes of a young boy
those were not my clothes this is my
real expression this is real of me and
I'm very proud on it
but I will not forgive any of the human
being
who mistreated me I will not
I will not forget my brothers
they say
that our society
will point us if we'll be sitting with
you
I am not a criminal
I'm a human being
[Music]
works for the Human Rights Commission of
Pakistan in Islamabad as an expert on
transgender issues in 2018 the
transgender person protection of Rights
Act was implemented it is a law that
provides equal rights to transgender
people in Pakistan
[Music]
so I'm a bridge between government of
Pakistan and this community
Reem helped lumna file a government
application for housing support
there are many needy people like me look
at her and her they don't own houses
first the government should provide us
with accommodation because a transgender
person's biggest worry is a place to
live
[Music]
a few transgender people have access to
government support many live off the
money that they are given on the street
here day by day they are exposed to
people's reactions like
there are good and bad people most of
them are bad there are fewer good people
we get a lot of questions someone will
say why are you doing this
we say to them we're humans like you if
we were valued as much as you we
wouldn't be begging
transgender women also work as dancers
and sex workers for many it's the only
way to earn money labor for which they
are condemned
sometimes a human mind comes under
satanic influence so transgender women
fall victim to lust they get murdered
they get invited to different parties
and then get murdered in Cold Blood
I know this from the newspapers
[Music]
not disabled then people's behavior
could be even worse than this there are
still good people in this market who
don't utter bad words otherwise in
crowds people grope us or do nasty
things
the problem is that if you kill a dog on
this side and on the other side you kill
a transgender person the transgender
person has no value but the dog does
she's also a human with two eyes hands
and feet a nose and a mouth she talks
like us why are we segregating them I
think they are like us
they are underprivileged in our society
and I don't see them being helped or
given jobs
foreign
[Music]
I wanted to be a superstar because
there's an actress inside of me but I am
neither a woman nor a boy if I was a boy
I would become a hero if I was a proper
girl I would become a heroine what can I
do that's why I've become nothing
[Music]
most transgender people in Pakistan are
rejected by their families when they
become aware of their identity the same
thing happened to Rheem 12 years ago she
was lucky A friend gave her a new home
she lives with him and his family in
Islamabad
she's my first sister
I have four and now I have five
[Music]
from the victim to The Protector
the journey was beautiful the Journey of
Tolerance of depression the Journey of
being raped many times
the Journey of
thinking
that I am somebody who is useless
my life changed when I was bedridden for
around one year in that time period I
was continuously asking myself dream why
are you wrong
why is this Society always Target you
okay there is no space for me in society
okay there is no space of me in religion
and I don't care anymore I am like this
[Music]

mostly transgender people come to us
with complaints about harassment mental
pressure and threatening phone calls

[Music]
works as a victim Support Officer for

[Music]

time she listens to us and then she
speaks to the other party and then our
problem gets solved there has not been a

God we're safe

Mano as
what gurus are transgender people who
take on responsibility for younger
transgender people known as chelas or
students the guru chela system provides
the transgender people with what they've
lost a care structure a replacement for
their families
[Music]
okay keep this money for cooking I'm
dying of hunger dying of hunger

[Music]
and four of her students live in this
two-room apartment
[Music]
I am a transgender person I am a [ __ ]
not from today but since I was 10. and I
will be one until I die
[Music]
and it's not just no transgender person
will leave this world
koibi why because they are happy in
their world
we are living very well in our own world
we have brothers and sisters
Fathers and Sons gurus students we live
in harmony
in Karachi a city in southern Pakistan
the women of the World Festival is
taking place it includes a panel
discussion where Reem and other
representatives of the transgender
Community discuss the current situation
conservative parties are trying to
overturn the law on transgender rights
the Senators think that this transgender
person's protection of Rights Act is not
under jurisdiction of Islam according to
them only intersex persons are the
transgender persons and then they think
that these transgender persons are the
source of sin they are badly misinformed
this legislation is all about basic
human rights
[Music]
even if the first steps for their rights
have been taken transgender people in
Pakistan are not free to choose their
gender they are marked as X
what is this ex giving to us no
privilege we cannot get married
and that is something which is very
close to my heart I am alone
because just because of my
reality
I am happy to be here although I feel
these men are cowards so
um they will not accept us
you know but forcefully they will
so we have you know that kind of stick
in our hand to to to make our visibility
strong to make to to make our acceptance
accepted
[Music]
we transgender woman expect from the
society social affirmation to respect us
as women
transgender is our adjective it's just
like a woman is beautiful it's just like
a woman is intelligent in the same
manner a woman is a transgender
for me I am a woman
[Music]
