on the 19th of July 1989 United Airlines
flight 232 took to the skies on what was
to be a routine trip from Denver's
Stapleton International Airport to
Philadelphia International Airport with
a stop on the way at O'Hare
International Airport in Chicago
but flight 232 would never make it to
its destination
disaster would strike Valley an hour
into the journey leaving the airplane's
crew fighting for the lives of
themselves and every single passenger on
board
United Airlines is a us-based airline
company that has been operating
continuously since 1931.
throughout the 1960s and 1970s they were
a popular choice especially for shorter
cross-country Journeys
though not the largest airline they were
still well respected in the industry
United boasted a fleet that remained
modern throughout the years with Douglas
dc-7s giving way to Boeing 737s then to
McDonald Douglas dc-10s as the company
matured
the plane flying as United Airlines 232
on the 19th of July 1989 was a DC-10
with the registration n1819u
the aircraft itself was 18 years old and
had seen a total of 43 401 flight hours
neither brand new nor so old that it was
nearing the end of its life
the crew on board had varying levels of
experience
57 year old Captain Alfred Haynes had
been with United since 1956 and had
flown more than 7 000 hours in the DC-10
first Officer William records 48 years
old got his start at National Airlines
in 1969 then flew with Pan-American
before joining United in 1985.
he had only around 600 flight hours in
the DC-10
finally 51 year old flight engineer
Dudley Dvorak had been hired by United
in 1986 but had accrued only 33 hours in
the DC-10
also on board were eight flight
attendants and a total of 285 passengers
many of whom were traveling with young
children Seated on their laps United was
running a Children's Day promotion at
the time whereby children under 14 with
an accompanying adult could fly for just
a penny many passengers had taken
advantage of this promotion hoping to
reach their vacation destinations with a
massively reduced fare
at 209 PM United 232 took off from
Denver with an uneventful climb to
cruising altitude the aircraft leveled
off at 11 277 meters or 37 000 feet and
remained there for an hour
the flight proceeded exactly as
scheduled until 3 16 PM when a violent
jolt shook the plane and everyone on
board
the jolt was accompanied by a loud bang
almost immediately the autopilot
disengaged and indicators showed Captain
Haynes that the number two engine had
malfunctioned he tried to reduce power
to that engine but found the throttles
jammed the crew were able to shut it
down completely but as they did so they
discovered they could no longer control
the plane with their control columns
flight engineer Dvorak found that all
the hydraulic systems essential for
controlling the plane were alarmingly
fully depleted all attempts to use
auxiliary power to bring these systems
back online proved unsuccessful
the plane entered a fugoid cycle a
pattern of flight where the plane moves
up and down in a wave-like pattern
at the same time it began banking
further and further to the right
the crew could find no procedures for
dealing with this situation
even a desperate radio call to United
Airlines maintenance yielded no results
in a stroke of Good Fortune 46 year old
Denny Fitch a DC-10 flight instructor
happened to be on board as a passenger
he recognized the rolling pitch effect
the plane was experiencing
since becoming an instructor he had
studied the crash of Japan Airlines
Flight 123 which occurred just four
years prior
that flight had also lost all Hydraulics
and had also endured similar up and down
fugoid Cycles before crashing
after speaking to a flight attendant
Danny Fitch was taken up to the cockpit
there he worked with the flight crew to
quickly determine what the plane could
and could not do
they found that they were able to
exercise some rudimentary control and
steer the plane to the right by
adjusting the power to the remaining
engines
at the same time they could adjust their
pitch to counteract the fugoid cycle
Captain Haynes asked Fitch to take
control of the throttles so he could
focus on the control column
despite the precarious situation the
crew remained calm and collected even
lightening the tension with the
occasional joke
Fitch was recorded saying
I'll tell you what we'll have a beer
when this is all done
to which Captain Haynes replied
well I don't drink but I'll sure as hell
have one
the crew was able to turn the stricken
plane towards CU Gateway Airport
as they did so Captain Haynes requested
that air traffic controllers keep them
well away from the city itself
a sign that despite his calm humor he
understood the gravity of the situation
as flight 232 came into land a last
minute adjustment was made
unable to line the plane up properly
with Runway 31 as planned the crew aimed
instead for Runway 22 the exact place
where rescue vehicles had assembled to
await their Landing
these vehicles were quickly moved out of
the way
the plane approached high and fast much
faster than was safe with the landing
gear deployed before the plane touched
down it began to bank sharply to the
right
the crew increased thrust to the right
engines to counteract this role but it
was too late
the right wing struck the runway
breaking off as the rest of the aircraft
slammed into the ground
the fuselage broke apart from the
impacts and the fuel ignited
the aircraft disintegrated in a massive
Fireball with the mostly intact cockpit
and tail sections coming to rest in the
cornfields adjacent to the airport
even with fire engines already on scene
the fire was so intense that it burned
for more than five hours
the crash and fire were so violent that
First Responders were doubtful anyone
could have survived and yet many did
185 people lived through the crash with
one Survivor later dying from their
injuries
indeed not only did many people survive
but in many cases they helped one
another Escape The Burning wreckage of
the plane
passenger Jerry schemmell for example
lost a friend in the crash but escaped
the wreckage himself only to go back in
to save an 11 month old child
despite the actions of the surviving
passengers and the prompt response of
Emergency Services
112 people lost their lives in the
disaster
the investigation into the crash of
Flight 232 was Swift but not
straightforward
the main focus of the investigation the
number two engine was missing crucial
disc fan components that could not be
found at the crash site or in the
immediate area
its manufacturer General Electric put up
a bounty for the missing components
which was claimed when a farmer found
them in her field three months later
test results were conclusive the engine
disc van had developed a fault when it
was manufactured back in 1971.
the steel used had an impurity which
caused it to fatigue and crack over time
finally giving way mid-flight
United Airlines maintenance Personnel
should have caught this fatigue crack
early on but it was found that
procedures at United Airlines paid
little attention to faults such as this
one
the NTSB found that when the disk failed
it did so with explosive force which
damaged not only the engine assembly
itself but also part of the tail rear
elevators and the Hydraulics causing
them to leak out until empty
this explained why the crew had
experienced so much difficulty
controlling the plane
after the investigation was concluded
and the findings published many changes
were made in the aviation industry newly
built aircraft were given updated
hydraulic systems to prevent a loss of
hydraulics United updated its
maintenance procedures and flight 232
became a case study demonstrating
excellent crew Resource Management in a
crisis
indeed the crew worked together so well
that when challenged with a recreation
of the disaster in a simulator test
pilots could not match or exceed their
performance
the crew was highly commended for
carrying out what was referred to as an
impossible Landing Captain Haynes
received many awards and much of the
recognition though he always insisted
that credit was shared equally with his
fellow crew members who had all survived
the crash with serious injuries
Captain Haynes would go on to be a
public speaker on Aviation safety and
would appear in many interviews
describing his experience that day
a memorial to those who lost their lives
was erected years later the dc-10s in
United's Fleetwood continue to fly for a
number of years until they were
eventually retired in 2001.
though the crash of United 232 resulted
in the loss of many lives were it not
for the teamwork Ingenuity and
Incredibly calm response of The Crew The
End Result could have been significantly
worse
