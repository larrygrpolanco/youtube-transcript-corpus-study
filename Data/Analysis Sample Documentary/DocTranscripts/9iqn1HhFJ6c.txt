now ai is a great thing because AI will
solve all the problems that we have
today it will solve
employment it will solve
disease it will solve
poverty but it will also create new
problems
the problem of fake news is going to be
a million times
worse cyber attacks will become much
more
extreme we will have totally automated
AI
weapons I think AI has the potential to
create infinitely stable
dictatorships this morning a warning
about the the power of artificial
intelligence more than 1,300 tech
industry leaders researchers and others
are now asking for a pause in the
development of artificial intelligence
to consider the
risks
[Music]
plain
God scientists have been accused of
playing God for a
while but there is a real sense in which
we are creating something very different
from anything you've created so
far yeah I mean we definitely will be
able to
create completely autonomous beings with
their own goals and it will be very
important especially as these beings
become much smarter than
humans it's going to be important to to
have these
beings the goals of these beings be
aligned with our
goals
what inspires
me I like thinking about the very
fundamentals the
basics what what can our systems not do
that humans definitely
do almost approach it
philosophically questions like what is
learning what is
experience what is
thinking how does the brain
[Music]
work I feel that technology is a force
of
nature I feel like there is a lot of
similarity between technology and
biological
evolution it is very easy to understand
how biological evolution
works you have mutations you have
Natural Selections you keep the good
ones the ones
survive and just through this process
you going to have huge complexity in
your
[Music]
organisms we cannot understand how the
human body works because we understand
Evolution but we understand the process
more or less and I think machine
learning is in a similar state right now
especially deep learning we have very
simple a very simple rule that takes the
information from the data and puts it
into the model and we just keep
repeating this process and as a result
of this process the complexity from the
data gets transformed transferred into
the complexity of the model so the
resulting model is really complex and we
don't really know exactly how it works
you need to investigate but the
algorithm that did it is very
simple chat
GPT maybe you've heard of it if you
haven't then get
ready you describe it as the first spots
of rain before a downpour it's something
we just need to be very conscious of
because I agree at is a watershed
moment Well Chad gbt is being heralded
as a game changer and in many ways it is
its latest Triumph outscoring
people a recent study by Microsoft
research concludes that gp4 is an early
yet still incomplete artificial general
intelligence
[Music]
system
artificial general
intelligence
AGI a computer system that can do any
job or any task that a human does but
only
better there is some probability the AGI
is going to happen pretty soon
there's also some probability it's going
to take much
longer but my position is that the
probability that a ja would happen soon
is high enough that we should take it
[Music]
seriously and it's going to be very
important to make these very smart
capable systems be aligned and act in
our best
interest the very first agis will be
basically very very large data
centers packed with specialized neural
network processors working in
parallel compact hot power hungry
package consuming like 10 million homes
worth of
energy you're going to see dramatically
more intelligent
systems and I think it's highly likely
that those systems will have completely
astronomical impact on society will
humans actually
benefit and who will benefit who will
[Music]
not
[Music]
the beliefs and desires of the first
agis will be extremely
important and so it's important to
program them
correctly I think that if this is not
done then the
nature of evolution of natural
selection favor those systems prioritize
their own Survival above all
else it's not that it's going to
actively hate humans and want to harm
them but it is going to be too powerful
and I think a good analogy would be the
way human humans treat
animals it's not we hate animals I think
humans love animals and have a lot of
affection for
them but when the time comes to build a
highway between two
cities we are not asking the animals for
permission we just do it because it's
important for
us and I think by default that's the
kind of relationship that's going to be
between us and agis which are truly
autonomous and operating on their own
behalf
[Music]
tough many machine learning experts
people who are very knowledgeable and
very experienced have a lot of
skepticism about
HL about when it could happen and about
whether it could happen at all
right now this is something that just
not that many people have realized
yet that the speed of computers for
neural networks for AI are going to
become maybe 100,000 times faster in a
small number of
years if you have an arms race Dynamics
between multiple teams trying to build
the AGI
first
they will have less time make sure that
the AGI that they will build will care
deeply for
humans cuz the way I imagine it is that
there is an avalanche like there is an
avalanche of AGI development imagine it
this huge Unstoppable
force and I think it's pretty likely the
entire surface of the Earth will be
covered with solar panels and data
Cent
given these kinds of concerns it will be
important that AGI somehow buil as a
cooperation between multiple
countries the future is going to be good
for the AI
regardless would be nice if it were good
for humans as
well
