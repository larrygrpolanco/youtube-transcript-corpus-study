sometimes the noise of news reporting
can numb the significance of a story for
example the ongoing talks with north
korea
over its nuclear arsenal the fury and
force of a nuclear bomb
something we all hope will never
experience
truly has to be seen to be believed
which brings us to this report from
david martin
miles back observers from all services
and several allied nations
stand by for the first daylight tower
shot
[Music]
the terrible swift power of nuclear
weapons has to be seen to be believed
this is a really big fireball i'll be
about two miles across
now thanks to a project headed by greg
spriggs
at lawrence livermore national
laboratory in california
the public can see them as never before
it's unclassified it's not a threat to
national security
starting in 1945 the u.s conducted 210
nuclear tests above ground
all of them recorded on film from as
many angles as possible
i now declare that the united states
does not propose to conduct
nuclear tests in the atmosphere so long
as other states
do not do so that ended in 1963 when for
the good of the planet
the u.s and the soviet union agreed to
stop testing in the atmosphere
let's play this in fast motion and you
can see that mock stem crawling up
unlike most of us spriggs understands
the physics that produces these
spectacular images
temperatures can reach anywhere from
about 10 million degrees up to about 15
million degrees initially
degrees calvin very hot very hot at the
outer edge of the fireball
is a shock wave but the fireball doesn't
vaporize
the shock wave crushes see those tiny
objects in the foreground
those are tanks about to be hit by the
shock wave
when it first starts off it's moving at
mach 100
100 times the speed of sound and then
there is the mushroom shaped cloud which
climbs into the sky spewing radiation
that's directly tied to the nuclear
fallout which was very very sensitive to
the cloud heights
using a computer to measure the cloud
from one blast
spriggs discovered the original
calculations made 50 years ago
were off by a full mile instead of 35
000 feet it was something like 40 000
feet and it was because of the way they
measured it
that made him wonder if calculations
from all the other blasts were wrong as
well
it was more than just academic curiosity
those calculations are used to predict
the performance
what spriggs calls the yield of today's
weapons
if you measure the shock wave radius and
you're off by one percent
you will be off by five percent in the
yield so spriggs set out to re-analyze
and then release to the public
the estimated 9 000 rolls of film that
had been shot
he found most of them in the archives at
los alamos national laboratory in new
mexico
birthplace of the atom bomb untouched
for decades
a vast scientific treasure trove left to
decay
i've had a challenge with some cans just
getting the can open
jim moy is one of this country's
foremost film preservationists
once entrusted with the supruder film of
president kennedy's assassination
he now has the job of retrieving the
only visual record
of america's most fearsome weapons i
want to first
once i open a can determine the
condition of the film and
one way is by smell because any
acetate-based film
as the base that carries the image
starts to decay
it will put off an odor which is called
vinegar syndrome smells like vinegar
does exactly it sounds like basically
it's a race against time
it really is because until those cans
are opened
you don't know the condition some of the
film has been lost forever
but moy was able to restore most of it
using a scanner to convert
each frame to a digital file here we're
able to analyze all the fireball films
in an automated way digital technology
allowed sprigs to analyze the films with
much greater precision those are high
energy x-rays running down the cable and
vaporizing the cable
and he found that the measurements made
decades ago over the pacific ocean and
nevada desert
were inaccurate the best they could do
in the 50s
was on the order about plus or minus
seven maybe ten percent
so we're talking maybe plus or minus 100
kilotons for a one megaton shot
a kiloton is an explosion equivalent to
one thousand tons of tnt
100 kilotons is about six times bigger
than the bomb which leveled hiroshima
killing a third of the population the
pentagon would not tell us if the new
data from the old tests had forced any
change
in current nuclear targeting plans but
that does not change the impact of
simply looking at
images like this frozen for one
millionth of a second from two miles
away
this fireball truly looks like an alien
come to devour the earth
what do you hope the public gets out of
i hope they appreciate just
how horrific these weapons are this is
something that
can kill millions of people in the blink
of an eye
spriggs is one of the few nuclear
weapons designers old enough
to have actually witnessed a nuclear
explosion
the 1962 weapon effects testing
operation
fishbowl a high altitude nighttime blast
over the pacific
this guy lit up like it was noon no
matter what direction you were looking
it just
lit up and it took about 15 minutes for
all the colors to
fade away how does the real thing then
compare with
the film it's amazing the difference
between what occurred out there and
what's on the film
as majestic and fearsome as those photos
appear
they don't come close not even close to
what you see in real life
