making movies and shows is more
complicated than you may think
long before the cameras start rolling
there is a considerable amount of prep
work that goes into finding the correct
landscape
actors script writers directors makeup
artists computer graphic artists
camera crews and the list goes on in
this video
we'll go over a general overview of how
today's movies
and high-end television shows are made
and some changes the industry is making

advantage of today's best technologies

making movies is something that's been
around since the turn of the 20th
century
while the end result of entertaining
audiences has always stayed the same
the methods of how things are done
before
during and after may surprise you let's
take a look at how movies and television
shows are made
it all starts with an idea about half
the time
someone will pitch an idea about a movie
to a movie studio
other times someone from within the
studio will come up with an idea and
shop it around inside the company and
seek approval
studio executives and bigwigs will weigh
the arguments of the movie
some of the things they'll consider are
cost of making the movie or show
audience size for who wants to see such
a product potential earnings at the box
office and rentals
chances of it becoming a breakout
interested parties in favor of
financially supporting a project
and the reputation it will give the
studio after a while deciding on whether
a project should or should not be
greenlit
scripts are written this can take
anywhere from a couple of months to a
couple of years
during either the proposal process or
script writing creative differences can
pop
up causing staff members to leave the
project sometimes
these result themselves in the form of
another but similar movie
being made and being released around the
same time from a different studio
once the script is finalized
pre-production ramps up in earnest
filming locations are scouted camera
crews are brought in makeup artist
booked
secondary directors hired lighting crews
found costume department and computer
graphics specialists are all hired to
make the movie
while traditional film location scouting
still occurs
a great deal of technology has helped
step in to allow directors to see
what locations or virtual sets will look
like
today locations can be scanned into a 3d
environment by a small local team
the data can be sent wherever a director
and his staff are
allowing them to recreate the location
in the virtual world
this allows them to have an idea of what
challenges they will encounter
if they choose to use this location some
things to consider
are what equipment to bring how to work
out logistics of bringing their
equipment
food water and personnel and ankles to
place the cameras for ideal
shots another area that is seeing a boom
are visual aids and sets
while you may know that hollywood likes
to use a lot of green screen to make
epic looking sequences
one thing that is changing is the use of
massive electronic screens that wrap
around a set
one of the first movies that used this
extensively was oblivion with tom cruise
in 2013.
however since then big productions like
the mandalorian
have used the large screens to help
envelop actors with a sense that they
are actually in their environment
on top of saving time on the backend of
post-production special effects
this helps eliminate the need for green
screen technology altogether
for large swaths of the movie saving
time and money
camera resolutions and screen pixelation
have come to the point where the human
eye cannot tell the difference when
watching the finished product
once principal photography is complete
the raw footage is sent to computer
graphics specialist to add in details in
the movies on top of video editors to
chop up the footage into the final
product
during the editing process the editors
will also adjust the scenes to match a
particular color palette
while all of this is happening there are
also sound editors who are working hand
in hand with the video editors to add
sound effects
from here directors will give their
opinions of scenes and hand instructions
to support editors
or directors to make changes once these
changes are made
a more finalized draft is sent to the
music composer of the movie
where a musical score is placed into the
timeline
once a director feels comfortable with
this draft it is sent to executives at
the movie studio to screen the movie
they will give their feedback for
changes they believe will be better for
an audience
sometimes reshoots are required costing
studios millions of dollars
as was the case with rogue one and
justice league
after several back-and-forths on this
the movie will be tested in front of a
small showing of volunteers from the
general public
based on their feedback the studio may
decide to make changes
or allow the current version to be
released from here
a special screening is arranged for
movie critics to allow them to write
about the movie in newspapers and
websites
drumming up interest and giving the
movie some free publicity
this is where you come in based on box
office returns and audience ratings
studios may then decide to create
sequels as was the case with the john
wick series
