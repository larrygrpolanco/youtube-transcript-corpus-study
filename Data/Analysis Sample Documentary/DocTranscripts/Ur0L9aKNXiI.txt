I'm 12 years old, in the seventh grade
My dream is to become an artist with charisma,
great vocal skills,
and be recognized worldwide
Because
whether you see it as a new direction, the fact that all the members are Japanese,
it doesn't matter how you classify us,
because I do believe we are paving a new path in this industry
I want to be with the members who have helped me grow and taught me so much
and who I can overcome anything with
I want to be with them from now and forever
X-GALAXY is a project to 
train and debut artists
who can be recognized 
not only in Japan but also in Korea, Asia, and the world.
You can't easily explain how the girls will rise to the top, but they have limitless potential
Because they're not gonna stop
I'm confident that we have the world's best team and the best system for training them
If we fail, I'll take all the responsibility
Don't be afraid
rather, just enjoy it all
Our bond is stronger than family
at X-GALAXY,
it's not only about the bond between the trainees who share a similar vision of debuting,
it includes all the staff members who have put their careers and lives on the line to see this through...
is extraordinary.
Now's not the time to be laughing
You guys are spending too much time sitting around
You don't have time to watch, grasp, and understand
You guys won't achieve anything if you don't stay proactive
Do that after you debut! You guys aren't on that level!
You're nowhere near that level!
You're just overthinking it, CHISA
Don't lose heart. Don't give up!
We will become the most amazing artists - more than anyone else
and become a team that we're proud of
The most important thing is our ambition to become stars
We are serious. We will definitely create stars
XGALX is a new label that 
has spent 5-6 years preparing and creating 
a new global artist girl group
We are independently carrying out 
the discovery, development, planning, management, and production of XG
Our intention from the beginning was to promote the girls in South Korea
on various music programs and shows
The sole reason being that Korea has the leading system when it comes to "idol culture"
It's not just another musical genre - it's a culture that has been developed by pioneers
who have fought fiercely and put in ther blood, sweat, and tears
As someone who has been involved in the KPOP scene for over 10 years
I have a great sense of pride.
As players in this industry
I believe that we have the opportunity to learn, grow and show a lot of people what we're made of
With our amazing music, content, and astonishing performances
as well as the loveable personalities of all the members and their well-respected charisma
we carry the vision of consistent growth
for all of the members and the overall group
We honestly struggled quite a bit with the question
 'Is XG KPOP or JPOP?'
While all of our artists are Japanese
and even though we promote and produce content in Korea,
we express our message on a global scale
by singing and performing our songs in English
With all the members of our international staff at XGALX
and with the desire to pave a new path 
for our girls and our vision
-through our music-
we've always asked..."Should we define and confine ourselves within a single category?"
It's still an ongoing thought...
In the beginning, new challenges are 
often perceived as uncomfortable for many
and that it'll probably be a bumpy ride...
but it's something we expected and were prepared for
More than anything, we wanted to show how serious we were
through our level of music and performance,
we hope to show as many people as possible, a new form of entertainment
This...
I think is possible
So we, as an all-Japanese group known as XG,
came to Korea to learn
and to challenge ourselves, and prepared ourselves
with the hopes and ambition of being recognized
As the person in charge,
I'm aware
that there are countless opinions
Anyway, the most important thing is...
Instead of defining what is and isn't KPOP
As those who are a part of the culture
It's our job to have them accept and enjoy our presence
as outliers and newcomers 
to the KPOP scene
I believe those are the next steps 
How we progress in the future
is how we will get everyone to understand how serious we are
I hope we can become a company that can take part in
further advancing the idol culture industry and market
I think it's something that's very meaningful
As the person responsible for leading XGALX, the representative, and as a producer
I wanted to be able to personally explain
our vision, direction, and identity
I hope you all have high hopes for the members of XG,
who have put in so much hard work and passion as they prepared for their debut
[2012 Idol Star Olympics Championships]
[Gold Medai DALMATIAN SIMON]
Many people may not know this, but
[My mother is Japanese]
my father is Korean and my mother is Japanese
[Given that it's the the Olympics, I would like to send hope to multicultural families]
[I didn't come in first through my skills alone]
I grew up spending a lot of time in Korea
and I also spent time in Japan, immersed in Japanese culture
so this is something that I believe to be my destiny
I wanted this all-Japanese group
to be accepted by Koreans
and to reach KPOP fans
I wanted to show how an unprecedented grop
can evolve
with a strong will and courage
And this documentary, "XTRA XTRA",
is full of our raw story, how we created and evolved
so I think watching this can help people understand
on a deeper level of who we are
Incidentally, the name "XTRA XTRA"
harkens back to the era where everyone got their information from newspapers
and in the US, when an impactful headline was out,
people would shout, "extra, extra!"
as they handed out newspapers
The passion that these girls have to become global artists
Their commitment and path leading up to their debut
was very harsh, and was at times warm
and other times held together by their strong and unshakable bond
so please watch the drama behind all of those events unfold
I'd like for all of you to watch this documentary. It'll definitely surprise you
I think it was the perfect name for this documentary
and given our team name is Xtraordinary Girls,
the fact that we ended up calling this documentary "XTRA XTRA" was probably also fate
so please look forward to it
XGALX, XG - we're now just taking our first steps
For those who may be wondering what Xpop is,
please watch this documentary
Hopefully our activities from here on out will be a good answer to that question
and I hope to show everyone how we consistently grow
Thank you, that's all from me, SIMON
HESONO O!
