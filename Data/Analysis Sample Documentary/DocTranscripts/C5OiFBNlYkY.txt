- [Narrator] It was theirs.
By virtue of fee simple,
the Osage tribe
owned clear title
to their entire reservation.
The Osage, unlike other tribes,
bought their home
in Indian territory,
and moved to what would become
Osage County in Oklahoma.
They hoped their new home
would have nothing the
white man would ever want.
The land was owned
collectively by the Osage,
an idea foreign to whites,
whose attitude was,
"Those savage Indians
should divide the land."
Each tribal member
would be worth
more than 10 times the
average American citizen.
But the Osage saw more value
in a place all Osages
could call home.
But discovery of black
gold changed everything.
Oil was discovered in the 1890s,
but the real boom didn't start
until the 1910s and '20s.
The Osage Allotment Act of 1906
forced the tribe to
divide their land,
with each Osage citizen
receiving an equal share.
The mineral rights,
everything under the ground,
would remain held in
common by the Osage.
The royalties paid
to extract minerals
was divided among
2,229 headrights,
one headright for
each enrolled Osage.
The Osage enrollment was closed
and there would only
be 2,229 headrights.
- You have to remember that
the oil and gas reserve
helped fuel the fires of World
War I in the United States.
And they paid
royalties for this,
for the privilege of
extracting this oil and gas.
And this royalty was
paid to the Osages.
And so these people
supposedly became
the richest people in
the world per capita.
(lively saloon music)
- [Narrator] Not surprisingly,
the Osages enjoyed their money.
New cars,
building fine homes,
decorated in the latest style,
and traveling to
exotic locations.
The Osage became the
envy of the world.
Major publications of the era
printed articles on
those rich Indians,
the richest people in the world.
The public perception
generated by the publicity
fueled the fires of
racism and greed.
- What they're doing is
they're making fun of the Osage
and the use of their money.
They're also saying,
"Look, they don't deserve
it, and they're wasting it."
And that's the two
messages that come across.
This is going against
the Puritan work ethic,
you work hard and make money.
Here are people who
are not doing anything
and they have
unbelievable wealth.
And so you're creating
kind of this atmosphere,
or this idea that
somehow or another,
taking money from the
Osage is not wrong.
- It was just a reign of terror.
That's what they called it.
There was no other
way to describe it.
If you were an Osage
and you had money
and you're a full-blood,
you might as well have
been walking around
with a target on you.
Everybody in the world
descended into this area
to try to find
every possible way
to separate the Osage
from their money.
- [Narrator] No one in
government at the time
believed Indians of any tribe
could manage their own affairs.
Because of this racist belief,
the Federal Indian Service
would hold in trust
the assets of individual
Indians, including the Osage.
Guardians were appointed,
and had complete control over
individual Indian assets.
- I think there might've been
a very nice little cottage
industry of certain people,
lawyers, who were
guardians of people,
and when I say
people, more than one.
They were guardian of
more than one person.
And they'd charge a nice
little fee to do this.
And they probably...
I don't know whether
they got wealthy or not,
but they certainly didn't hurt
their bottom line any at all.
- [Narrator] Many
guardians with Osage wards
took advantage of their position
to separate the Osage
from their money.
- Many of the whites
who live in Osage County
attempt to exploit the Osage.
It permeates all
levels of Osage.
There are bootleggers.
There are prostitutes.
There are gamblers.
There are burglars.
There are rustlers.
There are armed robbers.
They go, and all of these
people victimize the Osage.
But they're not the only ones.
The merchants create a
two-tier pricing level,
charing the Osage more
than they're charging
non-Osage customers.
Remember, it's not racist.
It's Osage.
- His name was Wakon Iron.
He was my grandfather's brother,
and therefore he
was my grandfather
and he treated me
like a grandson.
And the money was loaned
to an entrepreneur
from his account at
the Osage Agency.
Today we call it IIM account,
Individual Indian Money account.
And his money was just loaned
to the local entrepreneur
and they built the hotel.
And then he, at some point,
was paid 10% of
what was owed him.
They did that through a...
What did they call
it? Bankruptcy.
A bankruptcy hearing where
he wasn't well-represented.
He didn't know about it
until after the whole thing
was over and done with.
And then the guy
that built the hotel
then sold the hotel to
his brother for the 10%,
equal to 10%.
And then, through a
circle of transactions,
it came back to the
original scam artist
who ended up owning the hotel.
And it was kind
of a funny story.
One time, my grandfather,
he told me he wanted
to show me something,
so he drove me downtown in
Pawhuska, in front of the hotel,
and he stopped out in
the middle of the street.
And he had arthritis,
so he could drive well, but
he had trouble pointing.
But he pointed up to
this window and he said,
"You see that window up
there at the third floor
and the second window
over," something like that.
And I said yeah, and he
said, "Well, in the end,
that man who scammed
me out of the money,"
he didn't use the word
"scam," but he said the man
that did him out of the
money committed suicide.
He took the big jump from
that third-floor window
and landed on the
sidewalk below.
And then he said,
"But I'm still here,"
and so he felt that...
And he was a very
philosophical man.
He was a very good man.
To him, there was
no trade-off there.
He simply got the
better of the deal.
He lost some money in it,
but he had a much better life
than that man who
was a scam artist.
(bell tolls)
- [Narrator] One
all-too-common scheme
was to marry an Osage
headright holder.
Upon an untimely death,
the spouse would inherit
unimaginable riches.
- Okay, about my grandfather.
He died at an early
age. He died, he was 29.
Supposedly he died
of poisoned whiskey.
He came home one evening,
laid down on the couch,
and never woke up.
Supposedly, people
told me years later,
and this is probably
second-hand information,
that he was drinking,
or had some drinks
with some other people.
One of those people
was Kelsie Morrison.
But it seemed to me that
nobody else in that crowd,
maybe it was just Kelsie
Morrison by himself,
nobody else in that
crowd I ever heard of
ever got sick from
drinking that whiskey.
But Kelsie Morrison
was a bootlegger.
He was a known bootlegger. He
was a convicted bootlegger.
There's a case called United
States versus Morrison.
He's convicted of
bootlegging whiskey
on the old Pawhuska Road.
Purpose was for him to benefit,
with my grandfather's death,
of him either getting
some headright money,
or my granddad's
wife, Tillie Powell,
getting the headright money
and Kelsie would
benefit from it.
Because on Tillie's
tombstone, it says:
"Tillie Powell, wife
of Kelsie Morrison."
- The Osages at that time knew
somebody was killing them off
but they didn't know who it was.
They tell me they would
leave their lights on.
They'd put lights
around their yards
and they would try to get dogs,
and some people hired
guards and things like this
because they were really scared.
And with good reason.
- [Narrator] Local
law enforcement
was of no use to the Osage.
The sheriff allegedly ran
a brothel out of his jail.
The Osage tribal council
knew they had to do something
and hired the newly
formed FBI to investigate.
The FBI determined a
local banker, Bill Hale,
and his nephews were
responsible for many deaths.
But to convict Hale,
they focused on only one
of his murder schemes.
- Hale was not a smart criminal.
He was simply brutal.
And given the
way that society was up
there during those days,
he didn't have to be.
He didn't have to
cover his tracks,
or he didn't have to,
you know, take any precautions.
Because who was gonna catch him?
Who was going to
testify against him?
- They called it
the Reign of Terror,
because you didn't know where
it was gonna strike next.
You don't know whose house
was gonna be blown up next.
You didn't know who was
gonna be killed next.
You didn't know who
was gonna be shot next.
No.
No. They didn't have to
kill us for the money.
If they'd have hung
around long enough,
we'd have given it to 'em.
We do that today.
- [Narrator] The current
generation of Osage
feels that the money
was the least important
of their losses.
The knowledge of
traditions and ceremonies
could not be passed down
as it had for centuries.
The deaths of so many loved ones
created a hole in the
cosmos of Osage culture,
a hole that can never be filled.
- But I think every Osage knows
all these stories that I know.
And all the families
have stories,
all of the families
have tragedies,
and all the families
have account
of being taken advantage of.
It's just a part
of our history now,
and hopefully we're
making progress
of not being victims any longer.
We hope that over
a period of time,
we become a strong a group
of people as we ever were.
