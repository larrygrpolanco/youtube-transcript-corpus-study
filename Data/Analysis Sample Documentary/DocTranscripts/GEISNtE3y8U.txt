- Our next event is set
to be at fashion week
and it needs to be the biggest
and best event of its kind.
We've never done something like this
and it's the perfect time to do it.
We did New York before.
Not everyone was there.
Not everyone was able to be involved.
Yeah, it will be a lot, but
it's also gonna be amazing.
And what a reward for the
team to be able to see
all of that going on.
We need to top everything
that we've ever done before.
This is more sophisticated
and let's not forget
we've got our new creative
director on board.
(upbeat music)
- So I think one of the things on the list
that I really need to get sorted
I wanna have another look at the venue
and just make sure that
everything there is sorted.
Now, we've got the production
team coming in with ideas.
We need to make sure they
align with like the venue
and stuff and that it's all gonna work.
I'm so pleased with how
everything is going.
I was so nervous at the start,
but now everything's rolling
and we're getting on with things.
The team is just doing
absolutely incredibly
everyone's excelling at their own jobs
and all my fears and reservations
about things have actually
been calmed so much down.
I'm so excited to carry on
with organizing and all.
(upbeat music)
- So my name is Jade,
I'm the events and brand
experiences manager
here at PrettyLittleThing.
I have been here for about eight months.
And all I can say is it's been
a crazy whirlwind over time.
When it comes to a show,
my job's really not done
until the show is over.
Just working from concept
phase to execution
and then breakdown is essentially
everything that I would do.
So I work with every single team,
when it comes to the design,
the aesthetic of the show,
the logistics where is it gonna be?
What's gonna happen?
What are people gonna eat?
This is definitely gonna be
one of the highlights of my career.
I've always, always, always wanted to do
something in London.
And yeah, it's definitely
gonna be a challenge.
There's definitely gonna
be a lot of expectation
because it is London
based and we are all here
but I think it's gonna
be absolutely incredible.
(upbeat music)
- I think what we've pulled
together here is so perfect.
Definitely the best collection yet.
- Yeah, definitely-
- By far, which is so, so good.
I think every single time
we pull together a new one
obviously we say it's the best
one yet, but I do actually
think this is-
- 200%.
- This is something fresh
and it's so current.
And I feel like it's on trend.
There's something-
- It's very you.
- Very me and there's so in
here for everyone I think,
and the pieces are so versatile
so obviously they could be start
of a million different ways.
I think with the trousers
on some of the outfits
that are quite low, I
think if we make them
a little bit higher up,
just so that they're
a bit more wearable for like the customer.
I think the low rise is great,
but also when you wanna go out
for dinner with your mates,
you're not really wanting something
that's got your full belly out
so you can go out and enjoy your dinner.
- That's a lot more outfit to normal.
- Yeah, 'cause last time we
did 24, this time around 38
which is a bigger
collection, a bigger one.
So I'm Chris, I am head
design here at PLT.
At PLT, I oversee the design department.
I set the trends.
So when it comes to this fashion show
what my role has been is
basically designing the collection
alongside Molly coming up
with the concepts, the vibe,
the feel for it.
As a collection, it's
probably one of the ones
I'm most proud of because
it is really commercial
and it is like one way we
can just kind of have that
true PLT freedom 'cause Molly is PLT.
And I think that's why we work
so well together as a team.
And I'm just really excited
about what it's gonna turn out like.
Yeah, so these are the prints
that we've got within here.
So obviously just like a
classic kind of PLT vibe
but then I think we need an
element of like chic as well,
so it's a bit more high
end with our classic pop
of just brights basic list.
We kind of got a mix for everyone.
So we wanna keep it just kind of too muted
and having a tree pop there,
which is obviously our girl.
So that'll be great.
And we absolutely obsessed with the cloak.
This with the chiffon obsessed, love it.
The list we've got linens, chiffons,
we've got huge shoulder pads, knitwear,
twists, draw strings
this kind of whole night
is vibe with the boot.
- Cut it all.
- So like the favorites like
boom, boom is really like
elements of nine is elements
of true PLT, everything.
It's all here.
- I'm so glad we've had this meeting.
Definitely put my mind at rest.
Everything's looking exactly
how I think it should be.
And you guys have done an
absolutely incredible job
as always so hands in the middle.
(cheering)
(upbeat music)
- Yeah, rough idea to open.
Obviously we've got the idea
of a few neutrals pops of color.
but this cloaks definitely like-
- One of the key.
- One of the key piles.
- And we need to open with the key though.
We need to open one of the
favorite looks that we all love.
- So my name's Talia, I'm a
creative manager here at PLT.
If I could sum up my role
and my key responsibilities
it would be the running
of the studio day to day
and all the teams in between.
One of my main like highlights
is something that really
stands out to me is in 2019,
I found out I was pregnant
and that was not an issue for me.
But in terms of work, it was
like, okay, let's take this on.
Let's go to New York fashion week,
let's see what you can do.
And I was like six months pregnant.
I was just kind of running backstage,
out at the front, show calling.
Then I was running backstage.
This time it just feels
like more of a family affair
and just like a little bit more special.
Yeah, this time I won't be thinking,
I need to have a little sit down.
There's a lot involved
in terms of making sure
that we have the brand vision,
we have our PLT old school girls
that you're gonna see her
and you're gonna think,
yeah, she's a PLT girl.
Now when everything's confirmed
and it's like, okay, we've got the team,
we've got the models,
but it's now like, okay,
we need to put it all into play.
What's the run of show gonna be?
What product's going with what model?
How is that then gonna
be matched up altogether
to make an actual show?
I started off here in 2015
and I was just looking
for somebody to give me a chance.
It worked my little Tosha, can I say that?
And just worked hard,
gave it my everything.
Now it's just such a big
pinnacle moment in my career.
Have that special time with your child
but also be successful and
really enjoy and love your job.
We're doing a fashion
show and it's in London
and it's gonna be incredible.
(upbeat music)
- We have everything
prepped for the social plan?
- Yeah, I feel like G you were working
on the Instagram plan and that's
all pretty good, isn't it?
We're in a good place with that.
So I think them guys are ready
with the actual social takeover
- And I signed that off
last week, so it's all good.
- Yeah, you've seen that
but it's the social graphics
for just the livestream.
- I'm Becky, I'm the senior
social media manager at PLT.
So the social team are
gonna be responsible
for quite a lot during fashion week.
The main thing that we'll
be doing is the stream.
We do a live stream of the
show from start to finish.
My team is also responsible
for doing the story coverage
and Instagram coverage
of the show as well.
So there'll be a lot of
content going around there
on TikTok as well working
with the influences
to create little snippets of content.
What's happening on the
show, behind the scenes,
back of house, front of house.
I guess there are a lot
of pressures in my role
because what we put out
there on the channels for PLT
is essentially the PLT voice.
So yeah, there's a lot of eyes on it
internally in the
business, but also outside.
We have a lot of like fans
and consumers and followers.
PLT it's over 27 million at the moment.
It has to look great.
It has to represent PLT
as best as possible.
Now more than ever there's
so many eyes on PLT,
so we have to get this right.
- Anything you want me to work on today?
Because from here, I'm just
gonna like I say, speak stuff,
get contact sheet, get going.
Is there anything else you want me
to get prepared or ready for?
- I think you should start
red carpet interviews
just to make sure that we've
got the run of plan for that
as much as well.
- I need an outfit.
- You do need an outfit.
- Do I even have an outfit?
What is everyone gonna wear?
Like what are you actually gonna wear?
- Well we all have crew
t-shirts, but you VIP over here.
- Well, I'm gonna wear,
I'm gonna look really nice.
- I'm gonna punch your wrist.
- Stunning, that'd be great.
(clapping)
- This looks insane honesty,
these colors and these prints
like this cloak is such high quality.
- And we've done that across
all the colors as well.
So we've got the prints kind
of bring it all in together.
So you've got all your neutrals
then you've got your fun as we discussed.
And then you've got like your
classic strips basically.
- This bag.
- That is my favorite.
This with the boot, that
is my, hang in there.
- Oh, wow.
- Where's the boot?
- That's the vision.
- Come on now, come on now.
- Yeah, gorgeous.
- Stunning.
- Yeah, that'll be sick.
I love, love, love it so much.
- I'm glad you're happy.
(applauding)
- So there's a lot of things
that need doing still.
We don't have an awful lot of time
but we know that we can turn this around.
I'm so proud of the team so far
just because we've already moved forward
into the more logistical phase of things.
So we've got pretty much our
basis in terms of the creative
but now we just need to figure out
how we're gonna actually get it done.
- Nervous, excited.
There's a lot of pressure,
but good pressure.
We work very, very well
under tight deadlines.
It just adds the excitement
and yeah, just wanna get it done now.
- One sec Noc just called me.
- Hi, I'm here with Molly now.
- You all right?
- [Speaker 1] Everyone hear me?
- Hi.
- [Speaker 1] Hi, that's okay?
- Yeah.
- [Speaker 1] So I've just
got off the phone to Nicki
and unfortunately right
now we don't have a venue.
- Right now without that
venue we don't have a show.
It's the only venue I see
that show happening in.
It's a crisis I just didn't see coming.
I literally don't know
what we're gonna do.
I don't have the answers right now.
- Our date doesn't work for the venue.
And I think it goes without saying
that if we don't have a
venue, we don't have a show.
So I'm gonna have to make some calls
and figure out where
we're gonna do the show.
Hi, this is Jade calling from PLT.
Hi, this is Jade.
I wanted to find out
if you have any availability in that room.
No.
Could you maybe do the 16th?
No.
Yeah, I know it's such a busy week
'cause we really, really liked your venue.
- You have to think of a plan B.
- Team have put so much effort into this
and I've gotta turn around
and tell them it's all down.
There's nothing I can do.
I really dunno what to tell them.
(upbeat music)
