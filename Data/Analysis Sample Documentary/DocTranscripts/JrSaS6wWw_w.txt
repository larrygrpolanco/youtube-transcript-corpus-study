tell me about the first time you came to
Fuji
Speedway about 60 years ago my father
took me here for my birthday I think I
was six or 7 years old I fell in love
with cars here at a Speedway this is a
place I can devop the car to make ever
better
car so tell me about this car this is
the new Lexus
lvx this is the car which I drive in the
weekend this is my personal
[Music]
car this lvx that's kind of casual
luxury the guy is as comfortable as my
sneakers people think big is luxury and
small is
economical but that's not
true are smaller cars just more fun to
drive to me yes this is a special
edition more high
performance 1.6 L turbo engine with d8
direct automatic
transmission this hos power is over 300
which gives it really smooth
acceleration and also amazing to
power I can hear some music with this
car it kind of sings so so so so it's
fun to hear fun to drive is not only
just driving the sound smell all kind of
ingredients this lbs is the marizo
Edition right M you had them set this
car up to your personal taste yes as a
master driver I'm kind of a
translator like uh when you eating your
favorite
dish your favorite uh Chef gives you the
best amount of salt and
pepper that's exactly what it is this is
why it has a marizo b
[Music]
see
it's it's really good that's why my face
is always
smiling and I will just continue driving
and driving and
driving how long would you drive like
this on your own until I need to fill up
the
gas that's why sometimes my
mechanic uh doesn't fit it up just so
you can't drive
forever that's
right when you started becoming a master
driver you decided to drive under the
name
morizo tell me why morizo name nobody
knows so nobody care about who is
driving morizo is just a person who
loves car not only Toyota and
leas love cars means all kind of Cs in
the world when I am bizo I can talk more
