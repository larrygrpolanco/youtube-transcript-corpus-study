Lake?
Sorry, Mrs. J.
Lake's a little late today.
Again.
Thank you, Lucas.
Oww!!!
Lake! Detention!
Mrs. J?
Oops!
Mrs. J?
Mrs. J? Mrs. J? Mrs. J? Mrs. J!
Stupid detention, stupid Lucas, stupid Mrs. J...
When did you–
Give it back!
Heh. Okay, come and get it.
Hey. Ugh!
We shouldn't be here...
What, scared?
Ow...
This isn't really safe...
Can we leave– oof!
Haha!  
You got scared of a bird!
Shut up!
Shut up, shut up, shut up...
Lucas?
Who's there?
Not funny.
I'm telling Mrs. J.
Really? Think she'll believe you?
You wouldn't.
Watch me.
You thought it'd be that easy?
How embarrassing.
It's because of you!
Really?
It's my fault you can't make it to class on time?
It's my fault all my friends 
like me more than you?
It's my fault I'm just the better twin?
You're not better!
You just get me in trouble 
to make yourself look good!
What? No!
Everyone says, 'Oh, Lake. Why can't 
you be more like your brother?'
Yeah, well they wouldn't say 
that if they knew who you really–
Shut up!
You wish you were me!
Ow, ow! My ankle!
Why would I care?
Lake, help me up!
I'm sorry, okay, Lake?
Please!
Blaire?

Kayden?

Sorry, Mrs. J.
I think...
Lake's late again.
You know how he is.
Thank you, Lucas.
