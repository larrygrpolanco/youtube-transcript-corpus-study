[Music]
around the world 3 300 used tires are
produced every minute
this is a huge problem for the
environment one which every country
deals with differently
the emission norms
are maybe stricter in europe worldwide
the industry is looking for solutions to
reuse old tires
but what exactly does this look like
under what conditions do companies
recycle our old tires and who profits
from this
our mission today what happens to used
tires
to find out we start our research trip
in kuwait city
because here in the middle of the
arabian desert we can find the biggest
tire dump in the world
on an area of more than one square
kilometer the kuwaitis collect used
for months we've been asking for filming
permission we're only allowed access
under one condition
the landfill commissioner of the
government saba faye accompanies us
come from the
shop for a change like tire at kuwait
collected here
there is
six or seven million in this area
for
safety
then make a recycle for the time
[Music]
yes one damn big
danger
because
not go after maybe 500 years
or more yeah yeah put in undertale
the problem is not unknown but what are
the q80 people doing about it we haven't
seen anyone working on the landfill let
alone recycling
[Music]
now my planning
i am from municipality of kuwait
my job quality is
tired after
there is
a plant for the department to make a
plant
for a metal recycle now chose the area
to make this plant
nothing really happens here and hasn't
for years the country hasn't recycled a
single tire itself but then why do they
collect them
in business but
for the
environment
when dinner only
kd
he won't tell us from whom and why
after the first three questions the
interview is declared closed
under the pretext of wanting to take
some more pictures of tyres we're
allowed to film alone on the premises
and then we discover a few people who
are actually working
obviously something is happening here
some pakistani and indian immigrants are
sorting tires by size
but we're also being watched
the manager of a private company has
discovered us
we politely ask for an interview and he
actually agrees
a few months ago he bought a million
tires for a lot of money but even this
company doesn't recycle them itself we
are dealing directly with the factories
there so
some of the factories they are using
them to make crumb rubber yeah
and some factories they are extracting
the fuel today
apparently somebody does make money with
the old tires after all
the workers shred the tires into tiny
pieces and send them all over the world
in containers
but one thing is clear to us in kuwait
they have not yet found their own
solution when it comes to recycling huge
mountains of old tyres this is not the
way to be
this is a waste they shouldn't sell it
they should think about it not
commercially but environmentally
this is what this is our point of view
this is a disaster
and if they are thinking about it
commercially
okay this is this will cost more
problems
however he also earns his money with the
old tires his company is currently the
only one actively involved in the
dismantling of the landfill
it'll probably take years to recycle all
the tyres from the world's largest tyre
mountain
nothing is happening here yet and that's
why we're traveling to the world market
leader in scrap tire recycling
this mission takes us to vyborg in
denmark
the company has developed its own
process to recycle scrap tires almost
completely a closely guarded secret
plant manager lars rajholger is
nevertheless willing to give us an
insight
hello hello welcome
thank you very much nice to meet you
the dane's secret about used tires is
indeed strictly guarded
it's like fort knox yeah that's right
please come in
lars rawhauger leads us into the
delivery area first
about 25 000 tires arrive here every day
mostly from denmark scandinavia and
england
it's definitely not waste tires are made
of the very best materials the very best
rubber steel and textile
and it's a big big waste
not to recycle the tyres and produce new
raw materials
only the best materials go into tyres
after all they have to withstand extreme
conditions on the road but that's
exactly what makes them so difficult to
recycle
but the company has invented a unique
method to do just that so it's not
possible to show me the whole process no
absolutely not we are very careful about
that
only a very very few people are admitted
to our time
the rubber is cooled down
using like liquid nitrogen
minus 190 degrees celsius
and because of this soap becomes very
cold
it's more easy to crush into the very
very fine powder
what comes out of the machine in the end
is equivalent to new rubber
so old tires are turned into the basic
material for new ones
we have a good grip about tile recycling
in europe but
in the third world
this is a really big problem also
because that we
in the rich world are exporting used
tires to the third world
because they still have a little bit of
rubber left so we have in we have
enjoyed the tire for most of the
lifetime but the poor country get the
waste problem which
i believe is not quite ethical
once the tires leave europe nobody can
check what happens to them
we research and find a tire recycler in
india who claims to be the largest
recycler in the country using
state-of-the-art technology and he's
based in mumbai
the biggest city in a country that isn't
exactly known for being a pioneer in
environmental protection
we are curious about what to expect
because the company allegedly produces
fuel from scrap tires in the form of
diesel
drive to an industrial area just outside
mumbai
on the company premises we meet vishesh
agava the boss of the
[Music]
company we get a material mostly from
europe and different countries sell us
different kind of material so this
material let's say comes in from italy
and belgium
and we have different other type of
material like full tires coming in which
comes in from germany
and these tires then go through the
full processing
to produce diesel from used tires the
company heats them in a reactor this
process is called pyrolysis
tyre rubber consists of 65 petroleum a
valuable raw material that the company
wants to recover
to prevent the tyres inside the reactor
from sticking a worker throws magnesium
against the wall
we know this from climbing for example
and it's not dangerous
however the salt that's produced when it
melts is dangerous
and it's in the air constantly it
contains a lot of carbon
the world health organization therefore
classifies it as potentially
carcinogenic
after loading the process is finally
supposed to start
the machine is defective and we have to
be patient
it can happen after all the company is
currently setting up several new
machines
but while we're filming the repair work
we unintentionally record the following
conversation via the boss's microphone
normal i don't think they have so much
into problem about this dirtiness and
all right they're not filming that it's
not about their problems it's about our
plan being looking clean in the video
that's it
how does it care they are not pollution
control people that they're gonna have
reason enough to take a closer look
around
and this whole thing here doesn't have
much to do with environmental awareness
and it gets worse
only 50 meters from the machines we
discover this hut
apparently people live here
in the middle of the factory site and in
the middle of the dirt
[Music]
do you think do you think it's it's
healthy for them to live here next to
this oil things
uh
they don't live here they live on the
outside
okay they
water for the construction
but they're in this houses they live
there right
in those houses yeah no though that's
temporary accommodation only for the
construction phase okay the construction
workers and then they'll be shifted to
the houses
aha temporary accommodation
the idea to recover the oil from old
tyres is actually a good one
but the implementation here in india is
poor
above all
we wonder what impact this process has
on people
and the environment
[Music]
you can see the the reactor is running
now and there is no pollution
because there is good equipment for
treating the pollution but there is
something coming out what is it hot air
like like when you burn the natural gas
what comes out after burning natural gas
the same emissions are from the
the pyrolysis plants it's completely
pollution air pollution free
that's not quite true
we've spoken to experts from germany who
confirmed that this plant is a somewhat
outdated model where even sulfur can end
up in the air
dangerous for people and the environment
nevertheless in india it's allowed
[Music]
the the emission norms
are maybe stricter in europe and as a as
a collective
you know there's a collective decision
that they will not allow pyrolysis
to prove to us that the old tyres really
have become fueled the boss pours it
into his motorbike
melting down used tires to obtain fuel
has not yet become established in europe
however experts are researching this
technology and trying to develop the
process further
but how is the problem of used tyres
dealt with in germany
we travel to borg lengenfeld near
reagan's border where we visit one of
the oldest and largest cement plants in
germany
but what does cement have to do with our
used tires
[Music]
daniel schmidt is technical manager at
the plant
cement burning is an energy intensive
process that requires extreme heat
[Music]
the factory goes through about 30 tons
of rubber per day
the rubber in the used tyres has the
same calorific value as coal i.e one
tonne of tyres is equivalent to one
tonne of coal approximately this helps
us save our primary fuel
to burn cement the company normally
fires the kilns with coal and plastic
waste
the used tires can save up to 10 percent
of the coal
the tyres then burn together with
limestone in the rotary kiln
this produces cement which we use for
example when building houses
the advantage is that the steel from the
tyres melts with the cement and makes it
stronger
is there anything left over from the
tyre
[Music]
the flame temperature is 2 000 degrees
and the material has about 1450 when it
gets here so there's no rubber or metal
left of the tires
so the tyres serve as fuel and for
hardening the cement the only problem is
that cement works cause about three
times as much pollution as all air
traffic that's why only factories with
professional pollution control are
allowed to burn tyres
nevertheless rubber is a precious
material which can be used to make so
much more
the conclusion of our mission recycling
used tires is a problem worldwide
simply burning the valuable materials
may not be the worst solution however
the best solution for our scrap tyres is
currently being provided by the danes
with their approach to recycling
