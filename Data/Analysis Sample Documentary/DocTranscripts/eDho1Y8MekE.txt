Is a living legend in Nepal ?
The fifteen-year-old adolescent was rumored to have spent a year motionless meditating under this tree without eating or drinking
People came in there thousands from India or Nepal to bow to the one they believe is the reincarnation of Buddha
He became known the world over
Then suddenly in May
2006 he disappeared without trace until he recently reappeared just as mysteriously
No, one knows. What happened
A Miracle or a hoax. What is the true story behind the Little Buddha?
He was born in a small village in Nepal
One of nine children in a very poor family his mother Maya Devi
Remembers when he was eight years old he already wanted to be a monk
When he was a little boy he used to follow the monks he liked religious sites he liked temples
When he was 13 he left for a monastery in India. His family had nothing more
Until one day he was found meditating in the heart of this forest under a giant banyan tree
And for the next 11 months he remained rooted in the lotus position
Was he real ?
Then something incredible happened
In the middle of the night, some pilgrims saw the Little Buddha in the middle of a fire this extraordinary amateur footage
Clearly shows his monks robes on fire and the young man apparently impervious to the flames
And then another mystery he suddenly disappeared without trace
The distraught believers left the site, which they said had developed a sinister atmosphere
Maya devi ,  the little Buddha's mother found herself alone stunned and deeply saddened
Everyday she came to pray at the place where her son had been sitting
Since my son disappeared, I've been feeling ill it's as if a snake had wrapped itself around me and tried to suffocate me
His disappearance was all the more worrying because Nepal is in turmoil
A Civil war has been tearing the country apart for over 10 years the death toll is believed to top
13,000 and the population is on edge
When our film crew arrived in Kathmandu the capital was paralyzed there appear to be demonstrations everywhere
They are  journalists ! , they're looking for the Little Buddha
Welcome !! the way is opened the very mention of the Little Buddha was enough to get through
It's a 10-hour drive to reach the forest
And a rumor has begun to spread that the Little Buddha has returned
Some people say he may be back nearby here somewhere. I'm not exactly sure where I haven't been - same
Here everyone says that the Little Buddha is back everyone wants to go and see him not for sure
And the rumor becomes fact when a group of hunters find the Little Buddha in the middle of the forest
On hearing the news villagers flocked to the site these pictures were taken by a Nepalese journalist
They show little Buddha talking for the very first time
Since you disappeared ten months ago people wondered about you some had doubts about you
Thousands of people thousands of ideas
Everyone is free to think to have their own mind let them talk and one day they will know the truth
We want to protect you, but we're only humans what can we do do as you like I don't know
It's up to God to decide
But you'll be able to see me from sunrise to sunset
News of his return spreads like wildfire and the pilgrims begin to return a
Winding trail leads deep into the forest and police patrols are everywhere
Stop here and you can't go any further you'll have to leave the car here
There's another ten kilometers to be covered on foot
Most of the pilgrims walk or cycle sometimes from very far away to see the Little Buddha
Hello yes we're going to see the Little Buddha yes, that's the first time we're gonna see him then we're bringing him offerings
And the police escort our crew reaches the sacred enclosure and everyone has to take their shoes off quietly
This man just saw the Little Buddha he appears illuminated
He's a great, man
The first signs of devotion appear aside from the sound of footsteps, it's eerily silent
The pilgrims hoped to see the Little Buddha to touch him to talk to him, but they were in for a surprise
Behind the roped-off enclosure that prevents anyone from getting too close the young man had changed his appearance
The little Buddha's face was hidden behind his hair
Only a corner of his mouth was visible and for four straight days. He sat motionless
The pilgrims were praying fascinated and almost frightened by his body without a face
In the months since his sudden reappearance the seemingly miraculous has reoccurred
The young man has neither eaten more drunk how could he still be alive?
The only person who might have the answer is Prem a monk and childhood friend
He'd taken care of him before he disappeared and claimed. They could converse telepathically
Does he drink does heed
Never know he never eats not even fruit never drinks any water either
So is it a hoax we showed pictures of the little Buddha to been ad Westfeldt a
nutritionist
He says a person can only survive eight days without drinking
45 days without eating
Well certainly
Sitting in a that sort of position for so long without eating or drinking
After a while he'd become paralyzed by the muscles would atrophy yeah, and he certainly wouldn't be able to get up
He'd die for sure
In Kathmandu the Buddhist authorities also have their doubts we went to see one of the dalai lamas spokesman in his monastery
He's a scientist by training while impressed by the young man's fasting and meditation remain skeptical
The public them want someone there here well the power of meditation can them not certainly keep young people going to
In three months without suffering too much
They've been unverified reports of such things but to never move to never eat to never drink
No, I think that's impossible as I see admit I saw a particular
Me family - no I said pussy
Well perhaps Little Buddha has been eating and stretching his legs at nighttime
It's hard to know for sure
After sunset monks guard him and prevent anyone from getting close
Even the military are told to move off and would not dare to challenge the monks Authority
People we're not authorized to leave the soldiers on duty at nighttime. I don't know what's going on
Anyway, I can't understand how a man can stay like that without moving
And then there's the financial implication because the pilgrims always leave some offering
The small amounts of money left as gifts add up to six hundred thousand rupees
About twenty thousand dollars the money will continue to pour in with the return of the Little Buddha
hundreds of thousands of pilgrims are expected
The welcoming committee is planning to expand the rope to enclosure around the young man I
Hope there'll be enough rope
The sacrosanct area around Little Buddha has doubled in size
He said also himself and
Now you know those tracks all over the Nepal, but if it is running
Everything is hopping
Then it will be very rush
The money left by the pilgrims will be used to build a temple in honor of the Little Buddha
But lately construction has ground to a standstill
The government has confiscated the money until they have made sure that the Little Buddha story is not a charade
The further however is far from being extinguished
The young man promises to follow in the steps of Buddha his guiding light and to meditate for six years
Which means he has another four years of immobility?
ahead of him
You
