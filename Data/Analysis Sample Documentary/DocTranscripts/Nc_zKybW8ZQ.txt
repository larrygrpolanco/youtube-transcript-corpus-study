of this article that caught my attention

Prophet T

used to make us read in front me I was
one that one person that there was there
so there yeah so you are stuck with me
subscribe to the channel how do you not
subscribe to
such
subscribe to the L
privilege don't take yourself too
serious my friend calm down they say
this part I want you guys to see this
part this is very important okay based
on everything that we saw on that
documentary this statement is very
important it is signed by the
public this is important
describing it it as baseless
highlighting that the individuals
interviewed in the report were not
affiliated with the
church call me
delusion we saw footage of this people
coming the first time you know when
these people leave of course you know
they they took their videos you know or
they kind of captured their videos and
to see their
childhood we saw video
footage this is what happens when you
when you respond without seeing what we
saw so to go on saying that in a
statement signed by the public a Affairs
director scone faulted the broadcast
station and its documentary described it
as baseless and highlighting that the
individuals interviewed in the report
were not affiliated with the church
that's very interesting because those
mandms showed us proof that they were
there what's this um games that yall
like
playing who wrote this did they even
watch the
documentary we have
footage we have footage you know this
this is this is how polit this is how
politicians speak when they speak to the
masses you see
they they take you for a dum
D you see me I don't I'm not a fan of
being taken like a dum
D
okay so to say that the
individuals not affiliated to the
church okay nther news understand that
the church's intention in issuing the
statement was to clarify any
misconceptions that
may arise from the documentary which has
generated mixed reactions in Christendom
and among concerned Nigerian and
authorities I
guess definitely it should okay it is
worthy to note that the docu the BBC
documentary which was released on Monday
made news headlines and serious
allegations against
TV including accusation of mandms mandam
you understand we can't say those words
on these
platforms of some members okay so now by
the way you not some members these
people spoke about themselves don't say
members when you say me who wrote the
statement man who wrote the statement
public relations man wow going man why
are
going I mean like if you're in Public
Relation like you can't use loose
words or is it just me you can't lose
you can't use loose words like that oh
yeah yeah members no no no we're not
talking about members these people spoke
about themselves accusations
of members no it's not accusation of me
these people were talking about
themselves
so putting it as M but again okay we've
been take they're talking like
politicians note go back in that
statement it says that
however however scone has said that the
BBC investigative unit okay H and wat
the organ the people that do the the
investigation and them kind of things
came out this week with a weird and a
strange episode epe on the hey English
don't kill me oh autocracy against the
late founder okay and the church
emphasized H that the investigation was
carried out in a manner that deviated
from the ethics and found H you're using
English for nothing English for
nothing people
when
English ethics and Foundation of
principle and of Journalism M okay so
they conducted the investigations they
found people who had been speaking some
of these people had been speaking for
more than 10 years without the BBC so
when people come out here and claim oh
they were paid what money was bisa paid
she's been speaking for over 10 years
Paul he been speaking for how long what
money was mandam paid y are funny out
here I don't know if they think
this sometimes I think people actually
think we are
kids we not be kids as per the church
perspective journalist H being a a
watchdog hey necessitates the practice
of fairness and balance you were asked
for your comment you said you don't want
to comment because these things that's
why at the end the documentary they ask
they they stated
there we ask for the statement they
didn't
give for balance so now we are teaching
journalism now okay now we have been
taught what journalism should be okay
compromise fictional okay they're going
on about what journalist should do
interesting this is the L we're not even
going to read that part because they're
trying to teach us what journalism
should be doing according to the church
there are numerous individuals who have
experienced astonishing Miracles and
greatly benefited from the anointing and
the grace bestowed
upon upon them by the Lord
through whatever that is all about what
you talking about and it says that this
benefit when we are talking
about let's get out of the
statement
let's get it let's get this straight
here if there is accusations and your
way of handling the accusations that are
at hand is to come out and tell us about
the Miracles it means that you're using
the
Miracles and the giftings as a way of
shrouding whatever questions come that
that's that's a very that's a huge red
flag like I was not there okay it's
between it's between the
victims God and the man them
involved we are just reporting but for
me as a person who's supposed to be
looking and saying do I believe this I
doubt it when you now bring in subject
of Miracles okay if you now bring in
subject of Miracles what does Miracles
have to do with what we are talking
about when you bring in Miracles it
means that you use those things you use
gifting you use taking money giving to
the widows I took money I G so you you
have never read the verse that says if
you even if you bent your hand but if
you lack love it is as good as nothing
you've never read that
verse you know the
read wake up like this statement it's
such a it
said the first part of it it the first
part that's where the disrespect comes
in for me the disrespect starts right in
the first statement when they state that
you know what scone faulted at the
broadcast and station and its
documentary describing it as baseless in
in highlighting that the individuals
that were not affiliated with the church
that for me it's concerning
because that's a constitute that's
that's how you brainwash
people you see you brainwash people by
when they have seen something you try to
tell no no you didn't see anything you
know left hand you know the left
hand focus on the left hand there's
nothing over there's nothing anywhere
else focus on the left hand that's what
they are doing they playing tricks on
people you saw what you saw but they are
not AFF affiliated with the church yes
they are not right right now affiliated
with the church but they were in the
church so you're not you are telling us
something that it's contrary that's not
the topic whether they are now in the
church it would be funny if they were
still in the church isn't
it so the statement that we read
here from my perspective it's no
statement at
all it's no statement at all because all
it says is that there is a lord you know
you can do you know can start believing
your own life you can lie to people to a
point where you start believing your own
life this is questionable Behavior how
why tell us that these people are not
associated when we saw
footage so if you keep playing Left
Hand left
hand these are tricks it's how you
brainwash a person no no no you didn't
see that no you didn't see that as a
matter of fact there is no hand that's
moving I don't know what you're talking
about there is no hand that's
moving if you don't get it you don't get
it okay why say contrary to what we
saw why tell us oh yeah they said that
members
were no they didn't say members wa by
making it members some you're making it
vague
that's a very PR stand that's guys
please you
guys to be a is
difficult to be
a to be a chatan is difficult it's hard
work a statement that it's literally the
left hand left left hand no hand is
moving here and if you don't get what I
mean is that they are play Playing
Tricks on what you saw it's the very
same thing you see in the Bible when
Blan betas experiences a miracle and
they ask him so you say you got him what
do you say about him of course he's
going to say I was healed by by Jesus
but the question is not whether you got
the miracle the question is can you
change what you claim to have been to
have known as
truth that's the challenge so it's quite
interesting see this particular
statement here but yall tell me what you
think it's reality show with do daily
Christian commentary videos I it had me
confused I like I saw what I saw why are
you telling me I didn't see anything
pretty much confusing you tell me what
you think tricky see you and the next
episode other episodes done today done
in the pink comments subscribe to the
channel and I see you on a later
