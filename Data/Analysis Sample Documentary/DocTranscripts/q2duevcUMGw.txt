Cole VO: When the world was created...
ColeVo : Countless centuries ago...
Cole VO: It was made under a set of rules.
Cole VO: Rules by which all things resident, must abide.
Cole Vo: All things are limited to existing in only one place.
Cole VO: At any one moment.
Cole VO: To travel from one place to another...
Cole VO: Both time and energy must be sacrificed.
Cole VO: But our world is not the only world.
Cole Vo: Sharing the same space...
Cole VO: Beneath our limited senses....
Cole VO: Lies another world.
Cole VO: One likely much older.
Cole VO: One where the rules are different.
Cole VO: We should not know of this place.
Cole VO: We should be separate.
Cole VO: But Sometimes, those who inhabit this other realm...
Cole VO: Will cross over.
Cole: Come on emily, we need to hurry.
Emily: What was that?
Cole:I Don't Know.
Cole: Come on.
Emily: I Can't keep up Cole.
Cole: You have to.
Emily: It's behind us.
Emily: Cole it's going to catch us.
Cole: No it won't.
Cole: Don't look back emily.
[Static Screeching]
[Heavy Breathing]
[Static Sounds]
Emily: I can't keep up.
Cole: There's no time.
Emily:Cole.
Cole: Emily, jump on my back.
Cole: On my back now.
Cole: Emily?
[Sounds of pain]
Cole: Emily.
Cole: Emily!
Cole: Emily!
Cole VO: The markings are one of the few traces
Cole VO: of evidence that it was ever here.
Cole VO: It leaves primitive black carvings of its likeness
Cole Vo: along its path.
Cole VO: Any printings of the written word are torn to pieces.
Cole VO: These actions, I know, are the
Cole Vo: only windows into its mind.
Cole VO: Habits that developed in a deviant world.
Cole Vo: If I Could just understand.
Cole VO: If I could only fathom.
Cole Vo: Maybe...
Cole Vo: I could put an end to its third
Cole Vo: and most notable practice.
Cole VO: A world wide trail of vanishing children.
Cole Vo: Many likely unaccounted for.
Cole Vo: Where are they taken?
Cole Vo: And why?
Cole Vo: Only now
Cole Vo: have I started to feel that I may never know.
Cole VO: I may never understand.
Cole: Hey!
Cole: Tell me where she is.
Cole: Answer me you bastard.
Cole: Emily!
[Static Sounds]
Cole: Emily get back.
[Gun shot]
[Static disruptive sound]
Cole: Emily.
Cole: I said move.
[Gun Shot]
[Screeching]
Cole: Just leave us alone
Cole: What do you want with her?
[ Scream of Pain]
[Static Sounds]
Cole: Emily.
{Sounds of children playing]
Cole: Where you going?
Cole: Stop.
Cole: Agh.
Cole: Get Back.
Cole: Where you going?
Cole VO: After forty-one years
Cole VO: I Have never once come close
Cole Vo: to finding my sister.
Cole VO: How do you conceive something that has no face?
Cole VO: How do you find something
Cole VO: that adheres to no rules.
Cole VO: It...
Cole VO: Finds you.
Cole VO: All that's left of them after it takes them...
Cole VO: All thats left of her.
[Static]
Cole: I don't understand.
Cole: I Won't ever understand.
Cole:I just want her back!
