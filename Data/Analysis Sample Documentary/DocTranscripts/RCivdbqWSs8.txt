[Music]
At the start, it was all different.
No, this isn't your white picket fence American Dream start,
I mean the kid was popping pills for 
Christ's sake.
Yeah you think that sounds wild?
Wait until you hear this next part:
He didn't even need them.
That's right, his mom was what you call a hypochondriac
and self-diagnosing Champion.
A true medical infomercial evangelist.
Today three out of four doctors recommend
the ingredients in Anderson for headache pain.
She decided Kyle will be better off getting started on medication early.
For his health of course.
In reality,
it helped Kyle put on weight.
Growing up lower middle class,
his family lived paycheck to paycheck.
With hand-down clothes from his father,
and the daily medication routine,
Kyle was different.
It separated him from the kids 
at school.
Luckily his father was a hotel manager in Miami,
so when the hotel switched owners,
the entire family relocated to Dallas, Texas.
Thrown into a new environment,
the kid was desperate to change.
[Music] 
and [ __ ] did.
Kyle flipped the script,
he loved the waters.
In Dallas, he developed a passion for diving.
[Music]
His Relentless work ethic for 
diving,
later became the backbone of his trading.
He worked so hard, he even 
got a scholarship.
[Applause]
Besides diving,
College was boring.
Chemistry Labs,
molecules,
anatomy,
yaaaaawn.
It's putting me to sleep already.
But that's where his life was heading,
and he hated it.
Every chance he got, Kyle hit 
the waters to get his mind off things.
In his junior year at Uni, he faced the 
choice.
Picking an elective.
Knowing he couldn't take another life-draining class,
instead, he wanted something more exciting.
In his search, he came across a class titled "Options and Futures".
Deep down money has always sparked his curiosity. 
Ever since his childhood and his deep-rooted anxiety towards it,
he wanted to learn more.
So he took a chance,
and like an elk-steak fresh off the grill,
his juicy taste consumed him.
Up till now, his relationship with 
money had been one of fear and ignorance.
Even though his class covered a lot of the basics,
Bonds,
Stocks,
Options,
to Kyle,
it was the Book of Revelations.
The key to escaping living life 
paycheck to paycheck.
After the first class, Kyle took the class book back to his dorm.
In a week, he had finished the whole book. 
Despite his pre-med basis,
Kyle finished top of the class,
and it ignited his Fame.
He wanted to switch major.
[Music]
Fearing his parents' reactions,
he debated his choice.
Could he do it?
What if he didn't do it?
Would he spend the rest of his life bored out of his mind and unhappy as a doctor?
Nah, he didn't want that, so for the first time in his life,
the kid followed his gut.
He switched his major to finance with a focus on Real Estate.
Real Estate had always been historically somewhat safe.
Right after, he went crazy.
Kyle had become obsessed.
He was so intrigued with mastering the concept of money,
every day after class he walked off campus reading any Finance book he could get his hands on.
Plus, we're talking any Vincent Norman Peel on Tony Robbins book out at a time, and  
Tony Robbins wrote a lot.
I did.
In exchange for his college parties and endless diving,
at a slow pace,
he became comfortable with Finance.
Naturally, the kid graduated with a degree in Finance,
and undergrad in Real Estate.
He walked away with a solid understanding of finance,
and a feeling of direction.
From a spark flame, it grew into 
a burning desire.
His curiosity for compounding interest,
molded into resolve.
He knew he wanted to achieve Financial Freedom
by mastering Finance.
To become a grand master in finance,
he knew he would have to play in the big leagues.
There was only one place to go, that's wild enough to satisfy those desires:
Wall Street.
 [Music]
In the early 1990s, Wall Street was not a place you walk into.
You were born into it.
Yeah, business was booming, there was plenty of positions,
but it was a dog-eat-dog environment.
Competitive firms were doing whatever they could
to get an edge.
And only hiring the best of the best,
was part of it.
And best not as in skill,
but 'best' as in fanciest credentials.
You know, the Princeton,
Harvard,
Stanford type of credentials,
Places where you couldn't get in unless you had a wealthy family
or a senior-position Uncle
who will get you that spot.
It was Cutthroat.
But Kyle had already overcome his first obstacle,
his mindset.
I mean he was still permanently spinning pens
and tapping his feet in every conversation,
but hey,
mentally, he now had direction.
He wanted to get into Wall Street.
He wanted to prove himself 
and achieve true Financial Freedom.
No matter what the cost.
Educated on money,
Kyle is now thinking like the wealthy,
aiming to minimize the time he traded for money.
Plus, he had picked up the habit 
of reading books
from which he learned the power of positive thinking
and grit.
His credentials 
were probably as worthy as a Dogecoin.
Yet he refused to compromise.
There's nothing to go back 
to.
Kyle made a simple decision.
He was going to interview with every single Wall Street firm
until one of them, let him in.
Kyle wrote countless letters,
sacrificing any last bit of pride 
he had,
he knocked on all their doors.
But it got him interviews.
Some of these interviews were retail brokerages.
After his third interview with the retail brokerage firm 'Prudential Securities',
the interviewer asked him:
'Listen Kyle,
I'm gonna be honest with you.
We normally only hire experienced professionals.
People who are moving to their second career.
We've never hired someone straight out of college,
so why should I hire you?'
Or translate it transparently,
Why hire a kid with limited economic understanding and no wealthy connections?
To which Kyle responded:
'Because if you don't,
you'll be sorry.'
[Music]
But the high was quick to pass,
this was Wall Street.
And as a lot of rookies on Wall Street,
it was straight to the trenches.
For a year and a half, Kyle got his start at Prudential Securities,
where he went through all their global trading programs.
With minimal 
pay in crazy overtime hours,
it's mentally tough.
His superiors towards guts out.
He had no personal life.
But going through that program, Kyle learned a lot.
All the different hierarchies of thought 
and specializations of the big firms.
The Prodigy finished top of class at Prudential.
Within no time you got to offer for Bear Stearns.
With the $2500 he had earned, he bought his first ticket 
to Geneva
to explore a new industry:
Hedge funds.
[Music]
While it's nothing new to you Traders now, 
at the time it was revolutionary.
Like crypto nowadays,
in the 90s,
hedge funds was the new 
booming game.
Kyle wanted in.
But he was still a rookie.
His new role at Bear Stearns was simple:
Make the big shots look good.
He started out as a research analyst.
He researched potential interesting company stocks and presented his findings.
The big shots he pitched his ideas 
to were a group of short sellers.
Inspired by their work,
Kyle competed against fellow rookies 
and tried to work hard to impress the big shots.
Working long hours and often pulling nighters,
Kyle was hungry.
His focus in life was identifying overvalued or fraudulent stocks.
He researched 
everything from
East Germany shipyards
to Texas mortgage lenders.
Kyle's macro-analysis skills were growing.
His research tips were solid
but it wasn't enough.
If you wanted to get ahead and move 
up the ranks,
you needed an edge.
Something all the big shots that the firm would turn to you for.
An edge that no one else developed.
After years of grinding his way up at Bear Stearns,
Kyle developed his edge.
He developed the talent for sniffing out corrupt [ bullsh__ ],
and wasn't afraid to let anyone 
know.
Short Selling based on macro-analysis.
See, Kyle was smart.
He realized that most traders were limiting themselves by focusing only on the U.S markets.
Kyle wanted to keep the freedom of 
looking at a global scale.
Even though he often made micro-scale trades,
shorting overvalued U.S company stocks was still the name of the game.
But with this macro perspective,
he could also take Global-driving event trades.
This liberty allowed him to concentrate 
only on trades with the largest upside.
His edge was unique,
and every big shot at the 
firm,
wanted a piece of it.
At the age of 28, Kyle became senior managing director.
One of the youngest in Bear Stearns' history.
His tireless dedication had paid off,
but not without paying a hefty price.
He had sacrificed his youth to the firm.
Despite being behind the analysis of some of the greatest trades,
he was still answering to the big shots.
While he did all the work,
he 
still relied on the so-called experts to make the final judgment call.
They were the decision-makers.
From shaping his mindset in college
to crafting his skills and forming a 
unique edge over the years,
Kyle had grown.
But in order to satisfy his grand ambition
and truly achieve freedom,
he decided there was one final step to take.
Risking everything he had built over the years at Bear Stearns,
Kyle decided to start his own firm.
He launched his firm Hayman Capital Management LP
with 5 million of his own money and 28 million from investors.
The pressure and constant feeling 
of anxiety
reached new Highs.
But he knew, it was his only shot at achieving his grand ambition.
But starting your own firm is not exactly a walk in the park.
It's like chewing on a piece of glass 
and staring into the abyss.
Not exactly a fun experience,
unless you're into that of course.
To build a hedge fund, you need reputation.
Since your sole purpose is to manage other people's money,
you need to figure out how to get the wealthiest eyeballs
on you
and well, Kyle had Jack [ s__ ].
Other hedge funds managers have reputations from their iconic trades
and historic performances.
Kyle wasn't known for anything.
To make matters worse,
he was now responsible for the livelihood of other people.
Kyle is good-natured,
he hated firing people.
Trying to figure things out he was burning through 
his fund's War chest.
A lot of it is on money.
With average performance,
some of the investors started to express their doubts.
Kyle had gone from the golf court,
back of trenches.
He needed a home run play quick.
He felt the pressure tightening around his neck,
[Music]
While at a wedding in Spain, Kyle was taking the 
edge off with some fine wine.
Finally catching a breather.
He struck up a passing conversation 
with the NYC investment banker,
who brought up an interesting topic:
Synthetic CDOs.
That's right.
A Bubble Boy.
For those of you that watched The Big Short,
it was the key to the 2007 housing market crash.
Aka
the synthetic CDO
was the atomic bomb with a drunk president
holding his finger over the button
Kyle couldn't believe it.
Confused with the depth 
of dog [ s__ ] behind the conversation,
he knew he had to learn more.
So at the hotel after, this dude 
gave him a number to a CDO manager.
At the end of the day, he took the call with the manager
who proceeded to explain to him,
the true complexities of dog [ s__ ] CDOs.
While he learned a lot from the call,
Kyle felt more anxious and disturbed than ever.
If he was right, it would bring down 
the entire economy and destroy millions of lives.
Chilled to the bone, all his trained corruption 
and fraud-detecting instincts pointed him  
towards a massive opportunity.
He smelt the dog [ s__ ] miles away
He had to figure this thing out,
so he set his eyes on a California shop called 'Quick Loan Funding',
small place started by a guy named 
Daniel Cedric, ex-car salesman.
But the dude was printing money.
Even funded a 35 million-dollar film for his fiancee actress.
His firm hired private investigators to test 
how hard it would be to get a mortgage.
Within no time, investigators all secured mortgages 
with no income verification,
or down payment.
Based on additional internal research,
this was the biggest case in American history.
He knew he had hit gold.
The kind of trade that would get him his reputation.
But no one believed him.
Every investor he pitched, said he was crazy.
He pitched hundreds of investors in an attempt to get more capital.
With minimal success,
it looked hopeless.
No one cared.
The pressure from 
running his own firm was building up.
Burning through his cash,
losing even more investors' faith,
he had nowhere left to turn.
This call will make or break him.
Potentially losing everything, 
and utter humiliation in the industry.
His back was against the wall. 
With all the experienced investors 
telling him he was wrong,
it was hard to swallow.
When everyone tells you you're crazy,
you're the one that's insane.
The fear
was paralyzing.
[Music]
One night, working overtime in 
the office, he started daydreaming.
Reminiscing on how far he came.
His childhood,
the medication,
deciding to become a doctor,
the courage of changing his path,
and the years dedicated to 
proving to others that he was great.
His constant fear of feeling 
inadequate.
It had always driven him.
And then it hit him.
Nothing had changed.
It was the so-called medical experts all over again.
Everyone always knows better.
Regurgitating theory from the college medical books, or
rephrasing Morgage Stanley research reports 
in their fancy Brioni suits,
They all had the answers.
But how many of them, actually do the work?
He knew he did,
and he knew the corruption he found.
And so Kyle, made the call.
Despite the high stakes,
he would rather go out betting on himself,
than to continue through the fear of others.
Kyle decided
he would have faith in his own work.
[Music}
Reignited by his youthful flame, 
Kyle set out to short the housing market.
He switched up his approach.
Instead of pitching investors the opportunity,
he pitched them the low risk to reward.
His new approach was more risk-averse.
To reassure investors, 
he shorted the time frame.
Instead of going in early and maximizing profits,
instead, he would wait,
and let the key indicators fall first.
And then go in.
Fewer profits, but more investors.
And it was the right call.
With more investors on board, Hayman Capital 
took all hands on deck to prepare their biggest bet.
There was no going back. Kyle went all in.
If they failed, his firm Heyman would be over.
[Music]
It's August 26th, the head Trader at Heyman 
Capital charged us towards Kyle's office.
The KPIs they tracked on the mortgages 
have fallen below their set entry point.
Unnoticed to most, the falling 
dominoes had hit a point of no return.
Kyle's team began purchasing CDSs,
as a bet against the multi-trillion dollar subprime mortgage market.
This was it.
What followed was months of suspense and disbelief
that their positions weren't 
marked down the way they should.
The costs,
millions in premiums.
But unlike Michael Burry, 
he had started his trade way later.
As in early 2007, his bets started playing 
out.
Profits started rolling in.
Fear had started spreading as subprime 
mortgage lenders started going bankrupt.
Instead of enjoying the wins, Kyle managed 
to get more investors to tag along in his trade,
doubling down on his play.
The next few months were 
the most stressful period of his life.
If the fraudsters figured out a way to keep up with the facade,
Kyle's wins would revert back to 
the premiums,
and he could once again
lose it all.
[Music]
It was the perfect trade.
When it was all said and done, Hayman Capital made close to 4 billion for its investors of the trade,
Kyle used the leveraged power of derivatives to 
short-sell about 4 billion of Subprime Securities
to synthetic CDO Market.
In the following months,
news spread of Kyle's legendary trade.
He had earned a reputation,
so much so that Kyle testified as an expert 
witness before the U.S. House of Representatives,
and the financial crisis inquiry Commission.
With Hayman Capital's success, and 
making millions for himself in the process,
Kyle felt he'd become a master of his own fate.
While the legendary short 
saved his firm and made him crazy rich,
Kyle was still looking ahead.
Driven by his constant fear of inadequacy,
and the pleasure of proving people wrong,
[I constantly feel inadequate,]
[which maybe is what drives me,]
Kyle has his eyes set on becoming an A-Plus firm.
For the past few years,
Kyle has been focusing his research on what he believes is the next big opportunity for the coming decade:
China
[Evergrant on the brink of collapse]
and Japan
[it will be further depreciated,]
[or because, it can be overshooting,]
[it can be coming back]
What does your own research 
work tell you?
Is he right?
