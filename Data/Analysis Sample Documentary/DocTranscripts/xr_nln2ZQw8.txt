is 17 and Pregnant for the second time
teenage mothers are not uncommon in
Brazil especially in impoverished areas
many people are quick to pass judgment
they say all hope is lost any chance for
a future over
here it hurts who wants to hear that
their life is over
nearly half a million teenagers give
birth in Brazil every year making it one
of the countries with the highest number
of teen moms in the world

all ready for daycare
Victoria's due date is fast approaching
soon she'll give birth to her second
child almost every seventh baby in
Brazil is born to a teenage mother in
poverty-stricken areas like here the
rate is often much higher Victoria
doesn't like being labeled
everyone says what you're having another
baby everybody has an opinion about it
people say I won't be able to finish
school but my life is over but I won't
be able to do anything except sit at
home and watch the kids
she lives with her boyfriend Eduardo and
their daughter Lara in one of the many
favelas of Rio De Janeiro
Eduardo is 22 years old and trying to
finish High School
on the weekends he works in a snack bar
in the morning he takes their
two-year-old to daycare along the way he
passes the drug dealers who control the
neighborhood filming is forbidden even
life-threatening
Victoria was 12 when she met her
boyfriend she first got pregnant at 14.
they weren't using contraception
still she wasn't expecting it
the subject of contraception is still
Taboo in Brazil
former president bolsonaro and his
government even tried to restrict sex
education in schools instead he promoted
abstinence no sex before marriage that's
what churches preached to like many here
in the Favela Victoria's family is very
religious she concealed her pregnancy
from them until the last minute
I was so scared I thought my God I'm
only 14 and I'm going to be a mother I
was in shock I was crying all the time
and I was very very depressed
when she got pregnant the second time
she considered having an abortion
but doing so in Brazil is illegal and
highly risky
many still die from these secret
procedures conditions are often unsafe
because there's no access to
professional clinics
I'm back
Eduardo's occasional shifts at the snack
bar barely brings home the equivalent of
100 euros a month
welfare payments add about 150 Euros to
their income and half goes towards rent
their new baby dresser barely fits in
the one-room apartment and soon there'll
be a family of four
their financial problems are getting
worse
Victoria also tries to earn some extra
cash she makes house calls to other
girls in the favela
Victoria took a makeup course to turn
her passion into a profession
Al what kind of makeup do you want
something subtle love love
um
I earn a little money doing makeup that
helps a lot my dream is to open my own
Beauty Salon
but for now her career plans are on the
back burner so is graduating from high
school
she's in the home stretch of her
pregnancy
is one of around 400 000 teenagers in
Brazil who become mothers every year
even if these numbers are falling the
figure is still twice as high as the
international average in Brazil almost a
third of the population lives in poverty
thank you
in terms of population Brazil is the
seventh largest country in the world
with more than 200 million residents
social inequality is a huge issue the
affluent South zone of Rio De Janeiro is
worlds away from the reality of
Victoria's life
after giving birth the first time the
then 15 year old was referred directly
from the hospital to this NGO for social
services the Dara Institute is a center
for mothers in need including teen
mothers
social worker Katya Bauer helps the
couple set short and long-term goals
it's important that education doesn't
fall by the wayside so their job
prospects aren't limited when that
happens most Teen Moms find themselves
unable to escape the cycle of poverty
your daughter's only two yeah and now
there's another baby coming with two
children it gets even harder
Eduardo who said he wants to give his
daughter the life he did not have
been so it's time for you to reflect on
your family and think about
contraception
afterwards they have a consultation with
the doctor like most living in poverty
Victoria doesn't have health insurance
out of Shame she didn't get any regular
checkups until late in her pregnancies
the first time there were complications
common among teenagers
she needed a C-section to deliver her
baby
last time there was fetal distress with
your high blood pressure
her heartbeat dropped out
that means this is another high-risk
pregnancy
our goal is for them to become
independent and take charge of their own
lives we don't want them to require
another institution to do that
the Dara Institute supports mothers in
Social and financial need it's unusual
to see a supportive partner like Eduardo
here most here are single mothers
that's why the NGO also offers
vocational training that's compatible
with raising children cooking makeup
cutting hair Victoria has made use of
this opportunity as well presentations
and group discussions also provide
guidance and social support
you feel like you're in good hands
everyone here knows what's going on
we're all in the same situation and we
support each other
my dream came true a girl and a boy
ours too
Ria and Eduardo are looking forward to
the birth of their second child despite
the additional stress but without this
external support they likely would have
broken up as this the case with most
teenagers who become parents
we argued a lot but at some points you
need to work things out not only for our
sake but for the sake of the children
soon there will be two
they receive a bag with formula and
diapers
plus a grocery card worth around 40
euros
it's a vital supplement to the household
budget to get them through the month
[Music]
back in the Favela Moro de dendi in the
north of Rio
I didn't have a clue about anything my
daughter taught me many things because
becoming a mother so young is like
nothing else
she taught me to be strong to take care
of her to be a good mother to her
aren't you so pretty yeah yes you are
there
Sunday is Family Day they visit
Victoria's grandmother she lives just a
few houses away
we're not allowed to accompany her on
the street with the camera the armed
drug dealers in front of the door do not
want to be filmed
Victoria grew up with her grandmother
when Victoria was three months old her
mother left her here and ran off with a
new partner
this loss left its mark on Victoria
she sees it as one of the underlying
reasons she became a mother at such a
young age
I missed my mother's love I wish I'd had
a real mother of course my grandma is
like a mother to me but I still miss her
anyway
and I wanted to prove that I could be a
better mother than my mother was to me
the fact that Victoria got pregnant
before finishing school disappointed the
whole family but her grandmother Sonia
Oliveira did not turn away which often
happens to other girls
people say you have to kick her out
don't support her but I do support her
as long as we're alive we will help her
now it's up to her if she finishes
school
somehow the family holds together
despite the strain of various conflicts
and their tight finances
even Victoria's mother has re-entered
the picture the birth of her
grandchildren has brought her and her
daughter closer
Larissa is also part of the family her
newborn is her second child too
the baby clothes I was given are too
small for him I'll bring them to you
Larissa also became a member when she
was still
the family prays for a brighter future

Ty is through education and work
I'd like to study medicine
I still want to get my high school
diploma I want to work a lot and leave
the Favela and give my children a better
home to me
I'd also like to have a small beauty
salon because it's something I really
enjoyed
[Music]
selfie at Sugarloaf Mountain this is Rio
de Janeiro Victoria and Eduardo don't
let Bleak statistics deter them
we're hanging in there she's doing her
job and I'm doing mine to provide a
better future for our kids in a few
years
[Music]
I want to give them a better life work
hard to give them the best
[Music]
and with that Victoria says her family
planning is complete before her 18th
birthday everything else will follow
even if the way forward is not so easy
