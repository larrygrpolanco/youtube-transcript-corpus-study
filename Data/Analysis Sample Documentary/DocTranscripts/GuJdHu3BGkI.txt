foreign
cycle of training runs throughout the
year there is the rest face and then
there is a development stage you know
like pre preparation towards the season
and then they will have the
pre-competition
the pre-competition period is now where
you have a structured weekly training
sessions that are done on a daily basis
doing different types of training
the structure of that cycle
is that you have an athlete doing two
sessions of either endurance speed
training or speed training so that is
the general structure of the weekly
session it's a composition of speed
endurance strength training and Recovery
runs
okay
the best way to execute uh training to
achieve that component of speed
endurance and speed is to train on the
track
because you are doing it in a measured
area it's uniform you can also monitor
progress in terms of the times achieved
I think drug training is one way whereby
you can test yourself you can test your
muscles whether they can
that it can
help to be up and down up and down and
and it it tells us
in the next two months three months
[Music]
going up to 15 and 16 kilometers the
whole session
no because you go there with a set
volume let's say this week you're doing
thousands in maybe three minutes and 10
seconds
maybe after two weeks you know when you
go to the same track ideally for a coach
to monitor progress the time should be
moving from 310 which you did you know
some some weeks or two weeks back
should tour around
305 or even closer to three minutes
so besides
achieving the the speed that you are
looking for whether it is speed
endurance or speed it also is a a better
way of managing monitoring the progress
okay guys the 10 position is very
important for an athlete because it's a
fundamental these are fundamentals and
the colors
of lasting long in the spot
because it it builds your mentors mental
strengths
and also it is giving you extra
speed endurance
[Music]
the tempo session the real temp position
is a basic training
which is holding a consistent face
a consistent face can be if you are
doing a 10 kilometer or a 14 kilometer
training
it means that you are going to always
Haul on a constant speed it could be if
you are doing a 255 per kilometer or 250
per kilometer always
the lock that we are having in Uganda is
that when we are having a Tempo session
that we can go down the mountain so we
can do it on 1100 meters altitude so
that means more oxygen it is also the
only place we have in our area that we
can run on a flat Road
and yeah because of Flat Road lower
altitude the boys can and the girls can
run they can develop much more much more
speed
we are not doing it every week so do I
we are doing it about two times in three
weeks so uh it's a very important
session but it is also very tough that's
also one of the reasons reasons that we
are not doing it every week
perfect nice
you really have to be focused with your
mindset because
if you you have to battle
the edge of giving up especially when
you're doing a tough Temple session
sometimes you find that you are your
your brain is telling you that you need
to stop it is too hard so
you it really trains you mentally and if
you go for a race
I know that you will not be able to to
give up easily
[Music]
easy running Communists training that
give us 50 up to 60 percent of The
Athlete's performance
easy run is important for athletes the
main one is to as after hard the
training session or median training
session and or Long training body to get
a recovery
[Music]
for example if today is competition I
can do is running in the evening my my
body becomes to normal
the PS4 is running maybe as me it is
different according to the athlete also
that is different according to the
course area that means high altitude
or up and down or flat area
even in in Ethiopia there are many
[Music]
slow altitude sometimes High attitude
that's why the pace is different
[Music]
fan
it's like going for a gym
if you go to gymnasium you need to go
for more than three months in order to
cut muscles and become fit
s that you need to train for long
and for a longer period so that's
all the trainings and can cover there
and take all the distance
affection
this it needs consistency
that it doesn't need that you are happy
and tomorrow you are down it needs that
you run consistently and at you know
four months six months you will achieve
in a good way
uh what is really important for me is
that it's not so much the performance
is how
somebody moves from point A to point B
you can have an athlete that has
probably certain
ability and that athlete puts 100
percent
effort and achieves
100 percent
potential
to me as a coach that's the best thing
that I when I go home I really feel good
foreign
