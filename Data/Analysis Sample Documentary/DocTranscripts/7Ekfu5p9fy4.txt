today we're taking a look into a
never-before-seen
habitat which few people are brave or
stupid enough
to call their home the locals call this
online quick play the origins of this
name however
are unknown as for many finding matches
can be far from quick we will be
observing the natural inhabitants
of this largely misunderstood area in
hopes to gain
understanding of how the online players
endure the series of hardships
that make up their day-to-day lives
we begin with the online samus after a
long winter
this samus is finally ready to emerge
from their moth ball
in order to power up their charge shot
the charge shot is essential to the
online samsung survival
as without it they lose the ability to
play neutral almost
entirely but what's this it appears that
this samus is returning to its ball
it appears something has spooked it ah
a ganon if this cannon catches our samus
the samus is sure to lose a stock
wasting all the efforts
they've put into their charging the
samus will return to the moth ball
until once again it feels safe on the
other side of the stage
this ganon has very little hope of
catching such small and
agile prey this game of cat and mouse
will continue
potentially for hours until either the
samus is red
or the ganon gives up and sets off
looking for an easier meal
we now move on to the next mysterious
creature
lurking in the darkest depths of the
matchmaking system
this creature is one of the most
commonly cited yet
least understood online characters
the zelda the online zelda
is a curious case everybody knows the
distinctive tracks of an online zelda
yet it seems nobody understands why or
how these creatures come into existence
zeldas forgo the need to pay attention
to their surroundings
instead using their most powerful tool
lag
to bait their prey into running into
their traps
this zelda is using those special moves
to force her prey to come closer
and when this poor pichu is in striking
range the zelda uses a deadly
combination
of smash attacks and neutral b in order
to achieve the killing blow
the unique habitat of the smash ultimate
net code
means that this is an incredibly energy
efficient way to raise gsp
requiring almost zero thought or effort
unfortunately due to this extreme
adaptation if the online zelda
ever were to venture into the world of
offline play they would surely perish
but this zelda is an elite smash and she
is happy
for now
there is no single attack that comes
close to the infamy
of the online ness's signature move the
pk
fire while this attack may be easy to
dodge in tournament
in the unforgiving lands of elite smash
pk fire
reigns supreme by using this attack this
young ness
can devour prey many times his own size
locking them in place
using their large and unruly hitboxes
against them
the nest also has many nefarious and
deadly ways to finish his opponent
making this seemingly innocent fledgling
truly terrifying to any experienced
online player
the only thing that may cause this ness
any trouble is his inability to fly back
to his nest if for some reason he were
to fall out
many characters will leap at the
opportunity to catch a weakened ness off
stage
however the offstage ness is not without
any sort of defense mechanism
the power of pk thunder combined with
the inability to tech in this
environment
will make any potential predator think
twice about challenging this juvenile
the nest returns to his nest and is free
to continue to pk fire
until he finds an opponent at back to a
percent once again
so far we have seen online characters
that are highly evolved
to thrive in their environment
unfortunately
this is not true for every character
joker populations
were once booming however in recent
months
the joker has become critically
endangered the joker evolved for an
offline environment
requiring a lag-less setup to perform
their mating ritual
the low percent chain grab due to the
offline habitat
being destroyed at unprecedented rates
due to covert 19
the joker has been forced to try new
strategies while hunting its prey
the online counter can be tempting for a
young joker
however this strategy often backfires
leaving the joker defenseless
by utilizing arsene jokers can thrive
however arsene will eventually run out
will the jokers face a similar fate only
time will tell
the world online is often unforgiving
and unwelcoming to many playstyles that
would otherwise
be effective in the world of online
reactions and reads have very little
effect on the outcome of a match
which has caused a unique line of
evolution here
many of the most successful species have
evolved to do nothing
but follow a very simple set of
instructions in order to win
this brings us to the belmonts the
belmonts come
in two different subspecies the simon
and
the richter it is unknown why speciation
occurred
as today's top scientists are still
unsure as to what advantages
one may have over the other the belmods
rely
very little on their senses not reading
or reacting to their opponent
instead when a potential prey species
enters their field of vision
they appear to enter some kind of trance
where they are unable to do anything
except press the b button little is
known about this state
aside from that the only way to break a
belmont out of this trance
is to get hit by a holy fire at the
ledge which will then trigger
the forward smash feedback response
there is one thing that is clear about
the so-called
belmont effect and it is that this
effect is ubiquitous across all levels
of gsp
and skill level some may call this
boring but for these belmonts
pressing b is more than just a hobby
it's a way of life
ah the ganon we spotted earlier has
returned
it appears that this ganon wasn't
successful in catching the samus
as he is still on the hunt a gannon
rarely has to eat
one kill is enough to satisfy a ganon
for weeks depending on the level of
disrespect
unfortunately this insatiable desire for
disrespect
often causes many ganons to fail a hunt
the ganon was a very successful species
in the online planes many years ago but
unfortunately for the ganon
the more experienced locals have learnt
how to deal with these potentially
destructive individuals
smart off-stage play can turn these once
threatening creatures
into little more than a slight annoyance
the ganon is however
an incredibly important part of the
online ecosystem
as without ganondorf's there would be
little to no source of clips to put into
people's montages
even the weak and frail members of this
biosphere
are incredibly important to the balance
of the online world
the world of online is truly beautiful
but
it is at risk server instability
awful net code and dwindling interest
from players
are prime threats to quick play this
fragile ecosystem
will not last forever and it is up to us
to support it
so uh go out there and keep playing like
a [ __ ] degenerate
