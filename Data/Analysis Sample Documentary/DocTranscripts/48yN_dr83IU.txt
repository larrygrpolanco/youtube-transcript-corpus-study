head to Brownsville I met with a guy
called Max who showed me around and told
me what it was really like growing up in
Brownsville New York so just before I
left of rinville decided to go on Reddit
and see people's living experiences from
those who have lived there and this is
what I found I'm born and raised in New

friends from many areas and myself have
been to many hoods I'm not stepping foot
