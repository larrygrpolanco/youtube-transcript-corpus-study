when i was young growing up looking at
the mirror i didn't love myself
confidence is the key in everything in
life because when you want to achieve
something you can have
all the skills
in the world in order for the magic to
happen you need the confidence in
everything that you do and martial art
taught me confidence
[Music]

[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
what's remarkable about that first
meeting is how unremarkable it was
no one in that room would have looked at
george and said
ten years from now
this man will be considered the greatest
fighter on the planet
a great metaphor for who george st
pierre is as a person a guy who came
from nowhere
through his own study and hard work
took himself from obscurity to
superstardom and from that
delicate beginning
came the career of one of the greatest
fighters of all time
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
[Music]
to be honest
george's first
title fight where he defeated matt
hughes
george was still in a fairly immature
part of his career
physically
and tactically
he was the champion
but mentally he wasn't there yet
take it paul
overhand pull over
for me the most interesting one
is not the first time george won the
title but the second
[Music]
nothing
in my life have been given to me
easily easily easily easily
even when i was a kid one of the best
gift i think that my parents gave me is
to teach me the the value of hard work
george comes from a very grounded family
his his mother and father
did a fantastic job of raising a
strong-willed but still humble child
[Music]
[Music]
i believe my
my first loss
i lost it because of a lack of
confidence
and then
i win the title because after i realize
that everybody is a human being nobody
is invincible
soon after george had won the title
he got injured
and
took
a decision
which was
there's no other way to say it was
unprofessional he took on a challenger
matt sarah who was himself a very
dangerous opponent
in a state of physical injury
and
underestimated the danger
of his
of his opponent
[Music]
and i think that my second loss in my
career i lost it especially because of a
too much confidence
i had a false feeling of security
it makes me realize that no matter how
good you are
and how well you're doing you're always
at one mistake
to lose everything
that revealed very quickly that the
young man who had won the title
wasn't ready to keep the title
there is a world of difference between
winning a title and keeping a title if
you think it's hard to win a title i'll
tell you right now it's ten times harder
to keep
[Music]
i believe it's important to know where
you're from but not to be haunted
by the bad souvenir
the scars show where you come from but
they don't have to dictate where you're
going
[Music]
live
every second in the present
[Music]
you can see in george a natural
curiosity and intellectual curiosity
across many subjects it's not just
martial arts he's fascinated by
everything from
the study of dinosaurs to ancient
history
foreign languages it's
when you see that kind of general
curiosity you know someone will be a
good student
[Music]
after i retired i was diagnosed with
ulcer colitis it's a inflammatory of the
intestine
at the time i it was very bad i was on
severe medication
i've met a doctor jason fong who
introduced me to fasting
so i start to implement fasting into my
my life
then after i
met
paul saladino and he opened my eyes to
a new world
about animal based diet and it had a
very positive effect on my ulcer colitis
three
if you want to make a healthy choice in
your life you have to look at history
how your ancestor when they kill an
animal they go for the the organs
we have different tastes now especially
in the western world but we forgot some
time that the organs are the most
nutritious thing that we can get because
it has a profound effect not only
physically but also on the brain
on our creativity
how sharp we are
i like to learn about the the past where
we come from because i always believe
that life it's a repeating cycle and in
martial art the same thing if you're
fighting someone you look at his past
fight you'll see that he has repetitive
things that he does all the time
[Music]
people
say that after the uh the loss to mass
error george changed his tactics
and became overly conservative it's
actually not true
what he did change was his preparation
for pages
and so he went 180 degrees the other way
into almost overkill with preparation so
that nothing
got left
out of the equation
immediately i wanted to erase my loss i
was angry at myself i wanted
i never wanted
to be real i wanted to erase it but i
couldn't do that you cannot go back in
the past but i was doing the wrong thing
because instead of focusing on what
snacks what's
on the present moment i was always
focusing on i'm gonna beat him next time
i'm gonna get my rematch
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
oh
i met a guy
he's a sport psychologist and he says to
me said george you're not focusing on
the right thing
i said yeah but i want to have my
revenge he's like yeah you will have it
at one point
but
you need to go
and focus on the present right now
because that's what matters
so he made me carry a brick
a very heavy brick
he made me write the name of sarah on it
[Music]
after a few months i couldn't take it
anymore as i i want to get rid of the
brick and he told me are you sure he
said i said yes so he came to montreal
and
we went near the ceiling river and he
told me to grab the brick
and he said now get rid of it so i
grabbed that brick and i threw it in the
snare river
and it makes me feel so good at the time
i had like a relief of
pressure
and it it's a it's a physical gesture
that i did that at profound and pack on
my mental
i i remember it's very hard to explain
but i immediately focused on the present
on my
my upcoming fight i won the fight i
worked my way up add another title shot
after
and i was able to to get to get my
revenge and become world champion again
[Music]
warrior is someone who works really hard
to attain what he wants
he
will face many obstacles
he will hit many walls
but because he's a warrior he's gonna go
through it
and at the end he's gonna succeed
[Music]
i believe that people have a wrong
perception of life i believe that most
of them
believe that human beings that achieve
extraordinary
things were always successful and never
felt
i failed many times but i succeeded at
the end of my career because of those
failure those failure made me
better
you can distinguish between a martial
artist and a fighter okay a fighter gets
ready for the next fight if there's not
a fight coming up he probably won't
train
but a martial artist will train even if
he'll never fight again he sees the
value in what he does is an end in
itself rather than as a means to an end
when i was young growing up
looking at the mirror i didn't love
myself but
i loved who i could become
and even nowadays i'm talking to you i
still not achieve that goal people
believe is i'm only talking about my
career i still have a lot of things that
i'm working on in order to become that
person
the most impressive ones are those who
see their training
and the art that they're
studying as an end in itself
and will continue their study throughout
the duration of a lifetime
rather than for the duration of an
athletic career
i'm much closer now that i was when i
was a kid looking at myself in the
mirror
but i'm still not that idea human being
that i want to become
jesus
inaccessible
just
