mega machines channel represents marble
quarries in greece
this quarry has 25 levels
each level has eight meter height and
the total height of the quarry is 200
meters the first stage consists of
drilling
there are mining methods for cutting the
marble blocks with vegan drawer
wire cutting saw or chainsaw
[Music]
next is the detachment phase of the
marble blocks
[Music]
this process is performed using an
excavator with a custom ripper
each block has eight meters height six
meters width and weighs 280 tons
[Music]
extraction methods and the resulting
marble block sizes will depend on the
quarry in question
marble quarrying is usually done in
vertical cuts
however there are also cases where it is
also done in horizontal cuts
this shall depend on the area's
morphology
[Music]
wheel loaders are carrying the marble
blocks to the level arches where there
is more space to load the dumpers
carrying is done in the narrow streets
of every level
this can be really tough and requires
special handling by skillful operators
dumpers are loaded with special care and
sometimes need two-wheel loaders
depending on the size and weight of the
marble
dump trucks are moving the marble blocks
from the upper levels
to the bottom square of the quarry
[Music]
the square is the selection center where
the marble blocks are temporarily stored
there the marbles are washed after the
process of their extraction
before the marble blocks being
transferred measurements must be made by
specialists to give the correct shape
with the appropriate cutting
[Music]
method due to their large dimensions and
heavy weight the blocks need to be moved
and handled with specific machines both
during loading unloading and during
processing
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
the blocks are cut to dimensions that
will be suitable for subsequent
processing
cutting the marbles into blocks
the selection of marbles is based on
their quality shape and color
after the sorting and counting
the marble blocks are loaded on special
trucks to be transported to the
processing factory
so
blocks are generally stored outdoors in
the block yard until the next phase the
marble processing phase
they are introduced in the machine by
means of a platform that simplifies
their movement
they comprise diamond wires that can cut
the block in a vertical direction
in this manner they are able to obtain
as many slabs as the number of wires
they are equipped with
polishing method in this case we enhance
the marbles shine and color by leaving a
smooth glossy surface
[Music]
this would be the very last stage in the
marble preparation process in the case
of slabs that are ready for sale
otherwise the slabs would be subject to
further cutting and finishing procedures
[Music]
the marbles are ready for sale
