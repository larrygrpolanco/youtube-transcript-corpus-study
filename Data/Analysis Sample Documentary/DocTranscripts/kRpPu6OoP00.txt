[Music]
taliban fighters rule the streets armed
with weapons once used by their enemies
we see them all over kabul
the taliban's return to power has
changed millions of lives especially the
lives of afghan women
i feel like a prisoner nothing is in my
own hands anymore
before i could do whatever i wanted
of course i'm very much happy you know
there is no word
we are living like other people in the
world
the taliban are back and so is their
ideology but what's it like living in
today's afghanistan
[Music]
we head west out of kabul into the rural
province of maidan wardak the mountains
here where taliban land when usnato
troops were still in the country
driving is tricky and slow roadside
bombs and air strikes have left their
mark
the whole area was a battleground the
damage lines the road
in a small mountain village we have an
appointment with dr roshana quadak 2
centimeter
and my these walls they were not
possible
dr roshanak is not only a doctor
she used to be a politician and she has
long supported the taliban
i was in the first
first parliament
25 to 10 yeah yeah
that that parliament was good parliament
no
not uh corrupt
and i
i'm proud that i was there yeah
this is my house
in her large garden dr roshanak takes us
down memory lane
she had believed in building a new
afghanistan governed by parliament she
tells us working with the taliban
not against them
instead war engulfed the country and she
quit parliament in disgust
we didn't want america
why they came to our country he didn't
want this this is our country
i can't remember anything good
because
development of the country
uh education everything was stopped
in the villages and the provinces
due to war
her patients are still suffering the
deprivation of that war
dr roshanak is a gynecologist and runs a
small clinic from home
my shoulders and neck hurt it makes no
difference if i eat or not
because you have 10 kids is there a cow
no yes but it has no milk
she sees more patients than before
now that fighting has stopped traveling
is less dangerous
with the taliban things are good now
it's peaceful
before there was a lot of war and
fighting
we always lived in fear
but now it's quiet
every pregnant woman we meet here wants
to know the sex of her baby
oh my god this is also boy
you see these
this is one this this this is the other
this is penis you see yes no you
a boy is power of a family
he can fight
and you know if there are more boys and
a family that family is much
powerful
in the village if they don't have boys
and they have girls they are weak
everybody can attack on them
some of the boys she helped deliver in
the past are now fighters
she won't comment on taliban atrocities
instead she points to their roots
taliban god or bad
you know
everybody has their own
judgment
for me
talib was afghan all taliban were afghan
when she's not treating patients here in
her own clinic dr roshanak also works
for the taliban overseeing female and
maternal health in their provincial
health directorate
before we leave she takes us up the
mountain behind her house a fiercely
beautiful view turns her thoughts
towards the future
now i wish
for taliban to change their minds about
girls
without
activities of girls and ladies it's
impossible to
achieve development
it's impossible
[Music]
back in the capital dr roshanak's wish
evaporates
the regime is all male by the taliban
for the taliban
the drive through kabul reveals more
drug users and street children than
we've seen before
food prices are soaring
more than half of the population is
hungry
[Music]
in the evenings women sit in front of
the city's bakeries begging for a loaf
of bread
[Music]
i take the bread home and eat it with my
children
but it's not enough to fill our stomachs
i divide the bread in pieces and give it
to my children so that none of them dies
but our stomachs are never full
you will have a ministry spokesman in
asking about the whole goal
how do the taliban plan to help the
people they rule
we meet the spokesman for the ministry
of vice and virtue journalists who have
come to see you
blames the crisis on sanctions the
freezing of assets and massive aid cuts
imposed since the taliban took power
[Music]
for 20 years america and its nato allies
killed us with bombs and artillery
now they're trying to kill us like this
they are responsible for this the hunger
crisis is on them
his ministry makes sure people behave
according to the taliban's vision of
islam
we built the kind of state our nation
wants
our nation fought for islamic rule for
43 years and now we want to enforce it
[Music]
give us the rights of a free country
and let us make the decisions for our
nation
those decisions seem less focused on the
deepening economic crisis than they do
on policing the lives of women the
taliban want a gender segregated society
and yet girls who are still at school
dare to dream
who of you wants to be a doctor raise
your hands
but these girls will be out of school
long before they can study medicine the
taliban leadership has effectively
banned them from secondary education
on the street a rare sight a group of
women demonstrating for the right to
education and work
suddenly taliban fighters shoot live
rounds in the air
[Applause]
young women like aisha and her sister
are trying to find their place in this
afghanistan
i have lost myself since the taliban
returned to power
i'm no longer the girl i used to be
in the past i would feel proud looking
at myself i gave myself the name jasoor
the bold one
but now i have lost my spirit my hopes
are gone under the taliban
and it doesn't feel good
see at my home i use this to make coffee
you know
your country use this to make tea aisha
used to work for a un project she also
studied journalism at a private
university now she has lost her job and
had to leave university because she
can't pay the fees
how many cups of green tea do you
usually have a day
the sisters still go shopping without a
male family member to chaperone them but
that could change if the taliban gets
stricter on public gender segregation
aisha says she is largely withdrawn from
public life she used to be politically
active attending a lot of meetings
now she rarely sees people outside her
family
instead of talking in public she writes
in private
my country is tired tired of betrayal my
country you are songless and voiceless
aisha is angry she blames the west for
abandoning afghanistan to men who limit
her life
i would make sure that women could
choose any job they wanted
they would be allowed to study and to
live freely
the men would stay at home for a while
to learn what it is like to be a woman
to be prevented from working and
studying
at home they would understand how
difficult it is to be confined to a life
of raising children
they would understand what kind of life
of khan women have to tolerate alone
[Music]
but aisha's ideas and afghanistan's
reality are very very far apart
[Music]
at one of the many checkpoints in kabul
we meet izatola
he joined the taliban as a teenager and
left home where most people are farmers
to come to the big city
he now lives in a container next to the
checkpoint he wants to officially join
the taliban security forces to serve the
islamic emirate
the islamic emirate is a sharia based
state for muslims
all the people from my area are happy
and support the islamic emirate
we want sharia low and the islamic
emirate is enforcing that
that's why we want to work for it
when we suggest many afghans fear
taliban rule izatola and his friends
brush aside such
that is the concerns
they say talk of explosions targeted
killings beatings and arbitrary arrests
is nothing more than western propaganda
all the people in this container are
taliban and we're talking to you
we all walk the same streets
[Music]
we leave the traffic and bustle of kabul
and head for a very special mountain
village
[Music]
istalif was a foreigner's darling when
u.s and nato troops were still in the
country
its traditional pottery attracted
throngs of visitors from the capital
especially foreigners but they are gone
and so is their money craftsmen like
abdulmanan are in trouble now
hiranzu workshop with his son ramesh
we were in the market one day
we have a shop there too
many families had come to istali for a
picnic and to buy things
but then men from the ministry of vice
and virtue showed up
the taliban told families from outside
that they should neither come for
picnics
nor to shop anymore
has affected our business
i like working with clay and netting it
for my father i like every part of the
process
it's our family craft
but if no one buys their wares the
potters of istalif may not be able to do
what they have always done
pass their craft from father to son it's
a traditional life which abdulmanan says
has survived much but now feels under
threat again
there's no reason to attack us
we're professional artists who just want
to earn a living
but our eyes have seen so much war
after the war with the russians the
mujahideen fought each other then the
taliban arrived and there was more war
and now we have this
all of this is very scary
on the walk down into the village we
meet no one
the bazaar is deserted too
most shops are open but there is not a
single customer inside
we have traveled a hungry unsettled
country of vastly different truths
voices of descent are under threat
there is more security
but no reconciliation
you
