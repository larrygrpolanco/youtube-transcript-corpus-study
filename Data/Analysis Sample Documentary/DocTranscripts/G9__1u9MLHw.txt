>> Announcer: THE CITY MUSIC 
SERIES ON "TODAY" IS PROUDLY 
PRESENTED TO YOU BY CITI.
>> WE ARE BACK WITH AN 
INCREDIBLE COUPLE SHARING THEIR 
TALENTS WITH THE WORLD.
JON BATISTE AND SULEIKA JAOUAD.
>> SO JON HAS WON AN ACADEMY 
AWARD, A GOLDEN GLOBE, A FEW 
GRAMMYS, FIVE TO BE PRECISE.
SULEIKA IS ALSO A "NEW YORK 
TIMES" BEST-SELLING AUTHOR.
>> TOGETHER, THEY ARE OPENING UP
IN A PERSONAL NEW NETFLIX 
DOCUMENTARY.
IT'S CALLED "AMERICAN SYMPHONY,"
AND IT FOLLOWS THEM AS THEIR 
LIVES CAME TO A CROSSROADS.
>> JUST AS JON'S CAREER REACHING
NEW HEIGHTS, SULEIKA FACES THE 
BATTLE OF HER LIFE WHEN HER 
CANCER RETURNS AFTER TEN YEARS.
>> I FEEL A STRONG, STRONG 
DESIRE TO TAKE THE PAIN AWAY, 
BUT I CAN'T.
THIS IS A MOMENT, A TEST, AND 
IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT, AND NOBODY 
CAN CONTROL IT.
>> IT'S SO GOOD.
>> OH, MY GOSH, JON AND SULEIKA,
GOOD MORNING.
FIRST OF ALL, THIS FILM IS 
EXTRAORDINARY.
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN 
ANYTHING LIKE IT.
BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THAT, 
SULEIKA, HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
>> THANK YOU, THAT IS THE MOST 
COMMONLY ASKED QUESTION AND THE 
HARDEST ONE TO ANSWER 
TRUTHFULLY, BUT TODAY I'M DOING 
REALLY WELL.
>> AND AS YOU SAID BEFORE THAT, 
I WAS IN A WAITING ROOM AND NOW 
I'M HERE.
SO IT'S A GOOD DAY.
>> IT'S A GOOD DAY!
>> SO, JON, WE ALL KNOW YOU FROM
THE "LATE SHOW," AS A BAND 
LEADER, THEN YOU LEAVE.
"AMERICAN SYMPHONY" FOLLOWS THIS
UNBELIEVABLE PARALLEL PATH OF 
ALL OF THESE GREAT THINGS 
HAPPENING FOR YOU, YET THE 
PERSON YOU LOVE IS GOING THROUGH
THIS.
HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO DEAL WITH 
THESE TWO PARALLEL EMOTIONS 
GOING?
>> WELL, YOU GET TO THE POINT OF
REALIZATION, THAT THAT'S ALL 
LIFE.
THAT'S THE HUMAN CONDITION.
THERE'S NO DUALITY.
IT'S EVERYTHING, ALL AT ONCE.
AND THE BALANCE IS TO BE 
PRESENT.
THE BALANCE IS FOUND YOU'RE 
TOGETHER, LIKE YOU KNOW, YOU 
SEE, WE'RE PLAYING SIMON SAYS, 
WE'RE SO PRESENT WITH EACH 
OTHER, WHICH IS THE GIFT OF OUR 
LOVE, OUR RELATIONSHIP THAT I 
DON'T EVEN REMEMBER IT BEING IN 
THE HOSPITAL ROOM.
THAT'S JUST US ENJOYING BEING 
PRESENT TOGETHER.
>> YOU GUYS, I WOULD SAY, RELY 
ON CREATIVITY SO MUCH TO GET YOU
THROUGH THE TOUGH TIME.
JON, YOU WITH MUSIC, SULEIKA, 
PAINTING.
HOW HAS THAT HELPED YOU GET 
THROUGH THAT TIME THAT WE SEE IN
THE DOCUMENTARY?
>> SO WHEN THE CEILING CAVES IN 
ON YOU, YOU CAN NO LONGER ASSUME
STRUCTURAL STABILITY.
AND AS TERRIFYING AND 
DEVASTATING AS THAT CAN BE, 
THERE'S ALSO AN INVITATION TO 
REIMAGINE YOUR PRIORITIES, 
REIMAGINE WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT 
YOU WANT TO GIVE TO THE WORLD.
AND SO WE OFTEN SAY THAT FOR US,
SURVIVAL REALLY IS ITS OWN KIND 
OF CREATIVE ACT, AND WE BELIEVE 
CREATIVITY IS A GIFT THAT 
EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO.
>> GOD CERTAINLY GAVE IT TO BOTH
OF YOU IN ABUNDANCE.
NOMINATIONS FOR THE OSCARS COME 
OUT JANUARY 23rd.
YOU'RE UP FOR BEST DOCUMENTARY, 
BEST SCORE, BEST -- ALL THE 
THINGS, AND YOU'RE GOING TO WIN 
ALL THE THINGS.
SO MY WIFE AND I WATCHED IT LAST
NIGHT.
WE WANT PEOPLE TO WATCH IT ON 
NETFLIX, WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE 
AWAY TOO MUCH, BUT IT IS SO 
DEEPLY PERSONAL.
AND THERE'S CAMERAS FOLLOWING 
YOU AROUND WHEN YOU'RE AT YOUR 
HIGHEST OF HIGHS, AND AT THE 
LOWEST OF LOWS.
AND IT'S RIGHT THERE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO TAKE 
AWAY FROM WATCHING THIS 
DOCUMENTARY, AND FROM LISTENING 
TO THE MUSIC THAT SCORES THIS 
DOCUMENTARY?
>> WOW, WHAT WE REALLY WANTED 
PEOPLE TO FEEL IS THAT EVERYONE 
IS DEALING WITH THE SAME THINGS,
THE PEOPLE THAT YOU SEE THAT ARE
ON STAGE, PEOPLE THAT YOU SEE IN
THE PAPER, WE'RE ALL HUMAN.
WE ALL HAVE THIS TO MOVE THROUGH
AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE WITH 
THE ONES WE LOVE AND MOVE 
THROUGH THE SITUATIONS 
CREATIVELY.
WE DON'T HAVE TO BE A MUSICIAN 
WHO'S WINNING AWARDS OR A 
BEST-SELLING WRITER OR PAINTER 
TO BE CREATIVE AND MOVE THROUGH 
LIFE IN THIS WAY.
>> AND SULEIKA, YOU ADVOCATE FOR
BONE MARROW DONATION.
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
>> THAT'S VERY -- IT'S REALLY 
IMPORTANT TO US TO DIVERSIFY THE
BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT REGISTRY,
BECAUSE THERE'S MAJOR 
DISPARITIES IF YOU'RE A PERSON 
OF COLOR, IF YOU'RE OF MIXED 
ETHNICITY OR RACE, LIKE I AM, IT
BECOMES INFINITELY HARDER TO 
FIND A DONOR.
SO WE STARTED A CAMPAIGN WITH 
CALLED JOIN THE SYMPHONY, 
JOINTHESYMPHONY.ORG AND OUR 
MISSION IS TO MAKE THE BONE 
MARROW REGISTRY LOOK LIK
