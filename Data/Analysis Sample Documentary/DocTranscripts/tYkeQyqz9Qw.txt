[Music]
in this video we are going to visit the
mercy tribe of southern ethiopia
we will look at their customs
watch a house being built
and we will end by examining one aspect
of the impact of the western world upon
this remote tribe
[Music]
the mercy are nomadic pastoralists whose
lives center around their herds of
african cattle
over the years they have been featured
in many prominent magazines
because of their large lip plates
earplugs and the scarification that
makes patterns in raised bumps on their
skin
but this is only one aspect of their
lives
[Music]
the staple diet of the mercy it's a
traditional african porridge made from
mealy meal which is washed down with
milk
the grain is turned to flower using a
saddle coin
these tools have been used since
neolithic times and are said to have a
symbolic meaning too
for the two stones gently wear until
they eventually fit together as
comfortably as a husband and wife after
years of marriage
[Music]
women and children of all ages cook and
a wife will usually prepare food for her
husband
she must always wear her lip plate when
serving him as a sign of respect
from a western point of view it is easy
to judge these cultural ways
but as researchers we try not to
interfere
[Music]
okay
[Music]
mercy women cut their head hair short
often into wonderful patterns
but they believe that all body hair is
unattractive and pluck it from
themselves and from each other
this includes their eyebrows and even
their eyelashes
it is an important part of bonding and
friendship between the girls and starts
in early adolescence
okay
[Music]
the entire village moves every six to
nine months depending upon the quality
of the surrounding grazing
they do not move together but relocate
one family at a time
[Music]
the wives carry all of the family's
belongings
and the men will take a longer route
herding the cattle through the most
fertile grounds
and usually arriving once the compound
has already been established
often the hut building is done entirely
by the women and children as soon as
they arrive
but here our hut is being built to
welcome a new wife
so the husband joins in
their culture is very different to ours
and the wives will form a unit and
support each other while the men are
away hurting
sometimes for many weeks at a time
[Music]
[Music]
it takes three to four days to collect
the materials
mostly thin branches and grass
and the work can only be done in the
early morning or late evening
as temperatures can soar above 40
degrees during the day
[Music]
[Music]
rope is made from the pith of the bark
it is known as bast
it takes far more skill than at first
appears
[Music]
the branches need to be fresh and are
softened before use
foreign
everything is tied using bast to make
the structure as strong as possible
[Music]
[Music]
the ring tied at the base
stops the sticks from springing out
it is an alternative to making deep
holes in the ground to plant the ribs in
and it means a whole hut can also be
moved in one piece if necessary
[Music]
foreign
okay
[Music]
children start to join in from a very
early age and learn about architecture
at the same time that they are learning
language
building helps to develop fine motor
skills and complex problem-solving
abilities
it also keeps the children busy while
setting up a new camp and speeds up the
build process
the hut is protection against animal and
human predators
so the sooner it can be finished the
better
[Music]
door is narrow and low
anyone entering the hut must stoop to
the ground
[Music]
in the heat of the day
the women have set up a cowhide to be
prepared as a sleeping mat for the hut
it provides little comfort but is a
barrier against dirt and insects
it has already been stretched and dried
and now is scraped
not so much to make it soft but more to
make it light enough to carry between
caps
a community soon gathers and singing
helps the world
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
elephant grass is gathered for the roof
and then
[Music]
foreign
um
[Music]
um
[Music]
whatever
[Music]
wow
[Music]
okay
[Music]
an exoskeleton is placed over the top of
the thatch to hold everything tightly in
place
[Music]
inside the finished hut everything is
safe and cozy
some huts are small
here just for two friends
[Music]
others can be large
here for the chief who must be able to
entertain the elders of the village
before we move on to the final and more
challenging part of this video
you may have noticed that there are no
adverts on this video at all
and this is thanks to our new sponsors
one dream
our videos are expensive to produce and
we cannot do this without some support
we were more than delighted to form a
connection to this amazing partner they
have an incredible number of high
quality educational videos on their site
covering a vast range of subjects you
can learn about history and mathematics
dance and religion
but a few i have particularly enjoyed
have been the series on the mighty
warrior nomads of the asian steps
and the course by world leading
egyptologist belinda hartwig
who will tell you all the latest
research into the great pyramid
give you instructions on how to build
one for yourself
and also take you into lesser known but
equally fascinating aspects of egyptian
culture
as an architect i always want to
encourage everyone to draw
and it really is not that difficult
the courses by paul houston are
fantastic
especially those on pen drawing
with techniques such as hatching and
stippling all clearly explained
one dream are offering you a free trial
and please if you sign up by clicking
the link in the description below this
video
then this helps us to make more videos
for you
it helps them to know where the interest
comes from
and it helps you by giving you a trial
completely free
[Music]
the african cow by nature grows its
horns sharp and wide
and this is a useful defense against
predators
but in a herd this can cause problems
for the other cattle and for the herders
too
[Music]
as a result the horns of each young car
are reset
[Music]
some people may find this process
disturbing
and whilst it is probably painful
it does not appear to cause harm or
distress to the cattle in the long run
and it does save them from puncturing
the heights of their neighbors
[Music]
young men frequently take the herd off
from the village
sometimes for weeks at a time
and to avoid having to kill the cattle
for food they live off fresh milk and
blood
the blood is taken directly from an
artery
fresh
[Music]
we spent two weeks with these people
getting to know them
learning about their culture and their
language frequently treating medical
conditions and helping them in any way
but we were a little bit shocked to see
how many tourists turned up over this
period
such as these english photographers
photos of african natives fetch good
money
and the locals can hear them coming from
far away and quickly prepare themselves
[Music]
the photographers have arrived and lined
them all up
those selected will receive about five
cents each
the photo of course will be sold for
thousands of times this sum
but these english photographers don't
like it when i point to camera at them
and they send their guard over to stop
me filming
but i think i got enough to show you
what's going on
i would ask you to comment
is it fair and reasonable for us western
tourists to actually come into these
tribal communities at all
[Music]
still eventually everyone goes home and
the party can begin
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay
