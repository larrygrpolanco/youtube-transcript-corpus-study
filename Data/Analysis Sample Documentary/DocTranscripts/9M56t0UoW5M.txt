during my travels in india
i met a man at an ashram he was about 45
50.
a little older than everyone else
he tells me a story
he had retired and he was
traveling on a motorcycle with his wife
at the time
coming behind them
a truck ran into them
and it killed his wife
and he was
badly injured almost died
told he wouldn't necessarily walk again
in a coma for a while
when he came out of it and found out
what had happened
he
naturally was devastated and
heartbroken and
physically broken
and he knew that his road ahead of
rehabilitation and
physically and psychologically was going
to be hard
he had one friend who was a yoga teacher
who said we're going to get you started
on the path to recovery
so she came over and
threw yoga helped him be able to walk
again
after he could walk and
regained his ability to move around
he decided to head to india
and
explore some more yoga and while he was
there he
started to learn about meditation and
hinduism and buddhism
so he told me that you know he never
would have
thought to ever go down this path he
would have probably laughed at anyone
who
goes to india to find themselves
you know i said did you
get what you were hoping for
and he said
even though i lost my wife
i've never been happier
because it put me
on this path
i remember joking with my friend in high
school
that
can you think about not thinking we
noticed that the mind never stops
thinking
and we noticed that you really can't
think about not thinking
and that was a
kind of a question that
plagued me for a long time
there's a greater wisdom
that comes
when we're not clouded in thought when
we're not lost in thought when we're
addressing exactly what's happening and
not some mentally constructed
simulation of what's actually happening
we
always see movies and they have this
beginning and end but any movie you see
something happened before it started we
just don't see it
so we fall for this illusion that things
have this beginning and end
for a long time physics believed that
there was a beginning to the universe
and only now they're beginning to say
there might have been something before
that
we get attached to certain
people and
forms and
things and situations
the truth is nothing less the truth is
things will always change
when i was an ad man in new york
i had a unique perspective of
how
marketing and advertising works and how
it creates
demand
and how it influences people to
want products they would never normally
have wanted
and i was responsible for a lot of that
[Music]
more money
more clothes
more
luxury items more
cars vacations
nicer home nicer furniture
we all know this feeling of you want
something you get it you feel this rush
of dopamine and then very soon after you
crash and you want something else
the native americans have one of the
most beautiful concepts in the world
they have 10 000 different languages and
all these tribes and none of them have a
word for ownership or possession
they don't understand the concept of how
something can belong to one person
it's really a man-made legal
you can't
truly own anything
what you really realize is that
so much of what people get obsessed
about and go crazy over is just not
important not necessary
yeah i i suffer because i
crave things that i don't have
and i
have an aversion to things that i don't
want
when you can just
step back and see the big picture and
know that good things will come
good things will go bad things will come
bad things will go
then your happiness doesn't
rely on any kind of external situation
that's the key to lasting happiness
a lot of people
in our modern materialistic world
think that success equals happiness
that if they just get this position or
this raise or
this bonus they'll be happy
but personal experience as well as
scientific studies have shown that once
people's basic needs are met
more money
more success
bigger titles
do not make us happy
we almost
fail to see
the blessings we have
and we focus
solely on what someone else has we don't
have
[Music]
one
book i read was called becoming your own
therapist by a high buddhist llama
and that's to me what i found that
spirituality really is
when you realize
that
life is an illusion that
everything is one
that everything has meaning because we
project meaning onto it
that you can
kind of awaken from this
rollercoaster of life
step off
and just appreciate
in the marvel at the you know
engineering of the roller coaster or the
complexities of life instead of feeling
so
attached to it and consumed by it
we all have spiritual moments
throughout our lives
that first moment you see a sunset
or a flower
maybe a piece of art
and you just say
wow
and and in that really true awe
and wonder you know that childlike
wonder that
school's usually beat out of us
that is the moment we're all
fully present
fully alert
fully appreciative
and and there's a
a real connection
made between
the experience and the experiencer
god and the universe are really
interchangeable
words
the universe loves us god loves us have
faith in the universe have faith in god
it's all it's all the same i mean if if
god is everywhere then god is the
universe and
you don't have to believe in god to
believe in the universe
i am god but so are you
so is everybody
so treat everyone like god
including yourself
and remember
[Music]
even though you're god
you're no better than anyone else
[Music]
a wise man
once said
the universe created itself to
experience itself
through us
names are useful in that
they help you
know who someone's talking to
but they can also
be a deception
because the truth is we're all just the
same we're all one
who you are
who you think you are the the
personality you've constructed and that
other people have told you you are
your name your class
religion
whether it's a sexuality or a
gender or
nationality
this physical body
is
your house
you are
the inhabitant
and
the you i'm talking about
is the life force energy
the
conscious awareness which there is no
physical part of the brain or body
that science has
found that is responsible for
consciousness
and when we focus
on these
labels and identify
with our
temporary
experience
we mistake
our deepest sense of self with some
temporary experience
and we see people as labels
instead of infinite
beings of potential
and it allows for a dehumanizing
of each other
if you were to look
at human skin
under an electron microscope
you would not be able to tell
where the human being
begins and ends
[Music]
there is no
fine barrier between the person
and the universe
there is just
a flow
from one to the next
and the only reason we perceive
separateness is because of the
limitations
of our senses
[Music]
human beings can only see
[Music]
0.0001 percent
of
the spectrum of light
and we can only hear point zero zero
zero one percent of the spectrum of
sound
if we could see
infrared and if we could see ultraviolet
and x-rays and energy and
hear
the whole spectrum of sounds
the universe would appear very
differently
there would be no empty space
it would be so full
we would just see this sea of energy
and there would only be oneness
there is no
separate you
no separateness
there's a deep interconnectedness
there's only oneness
there's a difference between
loneliness and aloneness
loneliness is when being alone causes
suffering
but aloneness
is ultimately
recognizing
others as yourself
when you realize
that you are one with everything
[Music]
all suffering
exists in the mind
no matter what happens to you
[Music]
no matter how terrible
there can be peace
you are not your trauma
you are not your circumstances
[Music]
you are that
eternal
unchanging
light of consciousness
your true nature cannot be hurt
your body can be hurt your property can
be lost
[Music]
but nothing can touch the true you
space
silence
and
our
pure conscious awareness
are similar
in that nothing can alter those states
you can never freeze space or burn space
or
alter
space
in any way it's eternal
and unchanging
this is the nature
of
our true selves
the realization comes that
it's not your life you can't possess
something you are
you are life
all the
knowledge and wisdom
is in each and every one of us
you don't have to read any book or
belong to any religion
this is
a universal
and
available to everyone
way of living
never forget that every moment is a
miracle you know that's that's the goal
of spirituality is to
never
forget that
death is the beginning of the
last great
adventure and
exploration of humanity it's every
person
gets to go explore this thing that no
living person knows about
death and of itself is a beautiful
process it's it's like being born
death is the great equalizer no matter
how rich or how poor we're all going to
that same direction
everybody lives on through
life living on
we're all
the same life force energy
[Music]
and that
that'll go on forever
life will go on experiencing
the universe
as
the universe intended
[Music]
we've all been everybody
and we'll all be everybody
[Music]
it's it's about enjoying the good times
while they're here
and knowing they won't last
and when the bad times come
we uh
we know they won't last either
[Music]
[Music]
imagine a movie
where the camera is shaking all the time
[Music]
it would be
the worst movie you've ever seen
you could barely
focus on anything that's going on
and you'd probably walk out in five
minutes
stillness is
everything
an opportunity
to observe
our chaotic mind
and allow it to settle down
no matter what else is happening
[Music]
