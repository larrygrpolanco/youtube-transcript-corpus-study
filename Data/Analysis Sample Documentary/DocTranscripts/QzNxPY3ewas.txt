[Music]
from the living pine of the deep south
comes one of our most picturesque and
important agricultural industries
rich in the traditions of the past but
geared to the temple of the present
this industry presents a thrilling
chapter in the story of american
ingenuity and progress
[Music]
from these pines comes the raw product
called gum
the source of gum rosin and spirit of
gum turpentine
these two primary products are called
naval stores
coming from the early use of rosin in
the caulking of ships
and tarring of ropes
the united states produces about 75 of
the total world supply of these
important farm products
all of this comes from a group of eight
southern states
reaching from north carolina to texas
about one half of the entire world's
supply is produced in georgia
throughout the southeast
millions of acres of living pine are
yielding their crop of vital gum
to provide for today and tomorrow
only trees of nine inches in diameter or
larger are worked
working smaller trees would be
unprofitable and unwise
the outer bark of the tree is cut away
with an odd curved instrument called a
hogel
[Music]
when the rough bark is removed
the face is ready for installing tins
the broad axe is used to make a cut
about one half inch in depth
the gutters are then placed
and the tins are sealed with gum
an advanced streak is made to stimulate
production
[Music]
almost immediately the gum begins to run
from the face down the gutters
into the cup
a tree yields on an average of about
seven to eight pounds of crude gum a
year
shipping begins in the early spring and
continues for about nine months or until
late fall
a streak is added each week
about one half inch of wood is cut away
different instruments are used to streak
the trees
the one known as the hack is used for
low faces
[Music]
and the puller is used as the face is
worked up the tree
[Music]
crews of dippers harvest the crude gum
from each tree about every two weeks
during the summer months
this varies up to about four weeks
depending upon weather conditions and
the quality of the trees
following the same route on each
operation these dippers never miss a
tree
when it is not practical to work a face
higher another one is started on the
same tree
when the second face has reached maximum
height
the trees are used for lumber
pulp
cross ties fuel and many other uses
in the meantime
younger ones have been grown to take
their plate
the gum is collected in a dip bucket
[Music]
when the dip buckets are full they are
poured into a barrel on the wagon
[Music]
the filled barrels are carried to the
loading platform
here they are placed on trucks and taken
to the turpentine still
the crude gum is to be separated into
spirits of gum turpentine and gum rosin
by distillation
[Music]
the barrels are emptied into the still
and the gum is heated
[Music]
when the temperature reaches about 212
degrees
the turpentine and water begin to
separate from the crude gulf
distillation continues until the
temperature is more than 300 degrees
water being heavier goes to the bottom
leaving the turpentine on top
the residue is rosin which is released
and strained into vats
a sampling device is placed in each drum
and the hot liquid rosin is then dipped
into these drums to solidify
[Music]
these containers are then carried to
huge storage yards
these heavy drums weighing more than 500
pounds are unloaded with ease
[Music]
at the storage yard each drum is
carefully weighed
the rosin sample is then removed
[Music]
a trained inspector matches its color
with the official standard types
perhaps this is nancy
water white george isaac or mary
the grade and weight is written on each
drum
and this determines the amount to be
paid the producer
out into commerce this farm product goes
to meet vital needs at home and abroad
[Music]
the barrel turpentine is carried from
the still to the warehouse
later it is stored in huge tanks
and then is shipped by tank car to large
industrial users
and to packaging plants
[Music]
when packaged and sealed
the product is ready to be used in
innumerable ways in the household and
elsewhere
one of the principal uses of gum
turpentine
is for thinning paint the magic touch of
paint turns what was just a house into
an attractive home
more valuable more beautiful
and more enduring
floor pollen
insect powder
soaps
why even waxed crayons contain gum
products
plastic wood for mending and repairing
adhesive tape
liniment for sore muscles
camphor and hundreds of other uses
[Music]
turpentine and rosin for the manufacture
of rubber cement
[Music]
axel greece and other lubricants
[Music]
rosin for solder
[Music]
even in the arts
[Music]
for matches and cigarette paper
turpentine for shoe polishes
and rosin for paper sizing and printers
ink making possible our modern press
teamed up with the naval stores industry
science is creating new uses for these
farm products
and improving the older ones
[Music]
yes the living pine of the south
is helping our industry
our business
and our homes to meet today's needs and
to build for a better tomorrow
a tomorrow of better living
you
