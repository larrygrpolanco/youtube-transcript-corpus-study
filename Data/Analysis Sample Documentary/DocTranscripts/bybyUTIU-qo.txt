[Music]
for decades now
israelis and palestinians have been
locked in an ongoing dispute over a few
thousand square kilometers of land
the west bank sandwiched in between
israel and jordan
ever more jewish settlers are moving
here some of them from germany like
khayatal she lives in a launch foot
[Music]
personally i see no problem with our
living here it's a matter of how we live
[Music]
is a settler and to many palestinians a
provocation
for her part she claims direct contact
is the only real path
to peace
was born in saint petersburg in 1991
and grew up in cologne at age 19 she
emigrated to israel
she's been living in a jewish settlement
in the west bank since 2014.
the chain symbolizes the country of
israel i'm not a political person
i'm a religious person for one thing for
another i've got my principles
and one is that the land should be
unified for everyone who lives on it
lives in this converted container in the
alonso settlement
just over 20 kilometers south of
jerusalem
the united nations and the european
union both regard the jewish settlements
as violations of international law
as they're built on occupied territory
but the settlers justify their
initiative by citing an israeli court
ruling that declares the building
of the settlements legal our conflict
isn't over by a long shot
it may even get worse anything can
happen we might all contract the
coronavirus and wind
up in solitary confinement so nobody
will be able to attack the other
that'd be just dandy this corona corner
we first met haya in early march as the
purim festival was just getting underway
traditionally jews don costumes for it
and exchange
gifts at that time the coronavirus had
already come to israel
but the people were still getting
together to celebrate
they kept up their usual social contacts
and did not yet
practice distancing why did the settlers
prefer the relative isolation of the
judean mountains
on some of the most disputed land in the
world you mentioned
the people who live here do so partly
for their beliefs partly financial
reasons
just because it's cheaper or they like
the sense of community
i'd never lived in a community before
where all the neighbors are so tightly
knit
[Music]
really nice because it reminds us we're
not alone and that everything's not as
simple and beautiful as it would appear
at
the first bank is about the size of the
u.s state of delaware
but the potential for conflict is vast
about
430 000 jewish settlers live here
among 2.7 million palestinians
behind fences walls and barbed wire
the expansion of jewish settlements
extensively impacts the lives of
palestinians
like ali abu awad he comes from a family
of political activists
his brother was shot and killed at an
israeli checkpoint in 2001.
abu awad was active in the resistance
against israel
and spent years in prison he says he's
renounced violence
even if the discrimination continues
unabated
his palestinian license plate is enough
to get him stopped at the supermarket
by security
asked
the officer asks to see some id but
doesn't have any on him the officer
suggests he look for it in his car
and that he cannot let him into the
parking lot without an id
even if he did the next officer would
stop him so abu awad
offers to turn back
i forgot my id so i was not allowed to
enter
this doesn't happen to the israelis just
the palestinian that has to be checked
and if you forget your id it's a big
deal
[Music]
i feel sometimes that every palestinian
is a suspicion until you prove you're a
good guy
uh everyone here is like uh
freaking out in a way because there is a
lot of fear a lot of
different activities attacks any any
wrong
move in this junction in gushitsun
junction
any mistake with a wrong move
while you are driving it can cost you
your life
[Applause]
when i look around i see many
settlements are
surrounded surrounding this land
i mean this is what i see
and this is what palestinians face every
day for these people to exist and
practice
their identity there is a price of my
dignity and my rights
that i have to pay every day and this is
injustice
israelis are acting without considering
the palestinians
as fact on this land palestinians are
struggling to survive that
but also to start to harm the occupation
in any way
and this is endless i don't want to
spend my life doing this
i'm out of this victimhood and the
feeling of victim
in both sides is such a huge issue it's
even the competition of suffering
who suffers more none of us is going to
give up his right
none of us
for decades israelis and palestinians
have been locked in a kind of local cold
war
in which neither side wins
hayer shares this view and sees it as
unfair that she and other jewish
settlers
are called an obstacle to peace in the
middle east
450 000 israelis are not something to be
ignored
and you can't just classify several
hundred thousand people as criminals
and think you'll be able to expel them
for some political motives
personally i see no problem with the
fact that we're living here
it's more of a question of how we live
here of how we behave and how the other
section of the population
the arab inhabitants of judea and
samaria the palestinians
behave towards us of the kind of
interaction happening here
and it's not happening very positively
i'll have to admit
on the question of whom the land belongs
to there are no easy answers
people debate the issue and seek
dialogue with the other side
like khayatal rabbi hanan schlesinger
lives in the alonsford settlement
together with palestinian partners he's
launched the grassroots initiative
called
roots six years and six weeks ago
for the first time my life i had a
face-to-face meeting with the real
palestinian before that i had seen them
on the street
i had hired them to work in my house
they did my gardening but i never really
talked to them
i was completely thrown for a loop that
here are people
that i thought of as terrorists and they
have a human story just like mine
i was so taken aback to hear their
stories of living under occupation
i'd never used that word before i'd
never heard that word before in a
face-to-face conversation
here we are
both sides are an obstacle to the other
side's peace
our identities are the obstacle to peace
we have two contradictory identities
israeli say and it's true historically
that the whole land is ours that's true
we were here 2000 years ago
but the palestinians are also connected
to the whole land from the jordan
mediterranean in the same whole land
it belongs to both sides legitimately
rootz organizes regular events for
israelis
where palestinians talk about their
lives under israeli occupation
for some of the young men and women here
this presentation will be their very
first
direct contact with an arab
once an enemy becomes a partner there's
a chance of finding a political solution
that's the idea behind roots we have to
create a new reality
in which we live not at the expense of
the site but in partnership with the
other side
and the truth is that the best place to
begin creating that partnership is here
in the west bank slash trading samaritan
we live close so close to each other
this is precisely what khayatal set out
to do
in roots she got to know a palestinian
and over time they've become good
friends
he lives in hussain an arab village
halfway between alone shuts and
jerusalem
but the political situation does not
make such inter-ethnic friendships easy
signs even warn israelis not to enter
palestinian villages
claiming that it's dangerous hayatal
doesn't agree
she's even learned some arabic because
she wishes to communicate with her
neighbors
are determined to let what they share
and not what separates them
shape their friendship
either we decide now how we can live
together reasonably in peace
or one
[Music]
was detained for four days by
palestinian security forces
the mutual distrust runs so deep that
anyone who has contact with the other
side
is quickly suspected of being either a
traitor or a spy
even so there's something essential the
two share
[Music]
the desire for
it's the personal contacts that make all
the
i have lots of friends here both jews
and arabs
and i'm getting along fine here
in spite of their differences
and rabbi schlesinger have formed a
common bond
they're convinced it's the only way to
bring
peace to their own country
you
