john
f kennedy international airport more
commonly known as simply jfk
is one of three primary airports serving
the new york city metropolitan area
the airport handled over 60 million
passengers in 2019
making it one of the busiest airports by
passenger volume in the united
states and the busiest international air
gateway
into north america located in howard
beach queens
the facility boasts six terminals four
runways
and many more support buildings and
while you may be familiar with the
concourses gates and even views of the
runways
we wanted to know what is it like behind
the scenes
and who are the people that help keep
jfk running
in this episode we go behind the scenes
and give you an exclusive look at the
inner workings
of jfk airport this is airport uncovered
jfk
jfk international airport is comprised
of six
terminals serving more than 70 airlines
which fly to hundreds of destinations
across six continents terminals are laid
out in a loop
connected by road and rail via the air
train
at present the current terminals are one
two
four five seven and eight
you may notice there's currently no
terminal three or six
this is the product of decades of
merging and redeveloping of buildings
and no doubt is set to change again in
the coming years
as the airport continues to renovate and
expand
we start our tour at terminal one owned
and operated by a consortium of four
international carriers air france
lufthansa
japan airlines and korean airlines
terminal 1 houses 10 gates
several remote parking locations and
services
23 international carriers we spent the
day with ramp manager steve abraham
to understand what his job entails and
how this building operates
on a daily basis we would have between
40 and 50 flights a day
at the moment we're in we're probably at
18 to 20 flights per day
as traffic is continuing to increase
with
people wanting to travel again
[Music]
i am uh in charge of scheduling gating
making sure that i coordinate all the
airline schedules to ensure that we have
ramp and gate space for them i have a
staff of nine ramp controllers who work
for me who are responsible for the
movement of the airplanes both in and
out of the ramp now from the passenger
perspective this terminal has the
benefit
we thermal image all of our passengers
prior to going through security
just as an added layer of comfort for
all our passengers to know
that everybody on their plane has been
temperature stand
[Music]
trimmer one has ten gates at the moment
we're in the longer of the two departure
corridors we have seven gates down here
these are also all of our a380 gates are
in this section of the terminal
presently we're probably doing
throughput of about five to six thousand
passengers a day
which is a small percentage of what we
used to do there were days pre-coded
that we would do
25 000 twenty to twenty five thousand
passengers through here on a daily basis
we're not done with our tour at terminal
one and we'll catch up with steve again
in a little bit
but traveling airside to watch landings
and departures up close
we also got an inside look at how the
port authority does its part
in managing operations at jfk
a joint venture between new york and new
jersey the port authority was
established in 1921
but how does it fit into the complex
workings at jfk
the port authority is a major
infrastructure agency that covers
the entire region of the new york
and new jersey metropolitan area so it
covers
northern new jersey it covers new york
city
and we have multiple facilities
we operate the tunnels and
bridges that cross the hudson river we
run a commuter railroad and we operate
the three major airports in the new york
new jersey
area
on the air side the port authority is
really
being sure again in terms of vehicles in
terms of upkeep
runways have to meet certain standards
that's the responsibility of the
port authority the lights on the runways
have to meet certain standards
it's a split responsibility amongst
uh not only the terminal operators and
the port authority but the airlines
contractors who provide many of the
services but the overall
orchestration in terms of being sure
that the airport is functioning
in all respects rests with the port
authority
while port authority manages many ground
ops at jfk
terminal one oversees its own departures
and arrivals
but what exactly does that look like i
became an air traffic controller when i
was
29 years old and came to kennedy in the
early 90s and stayed
here until i turned 56 which is
mandatory retirement age for all air
traffic controllers
about 11 months after i retired the
folks at terminal 1
thought that i could help manage their
ramp given that i had such a good
understanding of how air traffic flows
around this airport since i spent more
than 20 years here moving the airplanes
around the airport
so this is the ramp control tower here
at terminal one while operation center
is one floor below
our ramp controllers work from up here
along with our ground service provider
coordinator
we only have one ground handling company
for all our airlines
so from the airlines perspective if the
station manager has an issue with
baggage if the station manager has an
issue with cabin cleaning
with catering with security will always
come through us
and we're the conduit to the ground
service provider it's
part of our model here at terminal one
the terminal manager on duty has
multiple screens in front of him at the
moment he's looking at the baggage belt
system
the intakes the laterals where the bags
where passenger drops off a bag
it gets fed through our baggage system
and then it gets sent out to laterals
down below
where our ground handler will pack the
bags
into the ulds before they're loaded onto
the airplane
and the baggage system actually scans
the tags
that you see placed on your bag and will
know which lateral to send the bags to
so all
the saudi bags will end up on one
lateral and all the turkish bags will
end up on another
and then they're packed loaded into the
containers and stuck on the bottom of
the air
stuffed into the bottom of the airplane
this is our gate plotting software
it is initially fed in with estimated or
scheduled time of arrival and schedule
time and departure it automatically
updates based on movements from the
airplane
so we will have a good picture
of what gate all the airplanes are going
to what time they're supposed to push
when the next arrival is supposed to go
into that gate
so we always maintain a level of
situational awareness up here
because you don't want to push an
airplane back when there's an arrival
just about to come in
because it's obviously you don't want to
cause your own ram congestion
while the tower at terminal 1 works to
minimize delays and missed connections
for its human passengers
there's another terminal at jfk that
specifically caters to passengers of
another variety
we took a short drive to meet the staff
and answer the question
what is the ark welcome to the arc at
jfk
this is jfk's animal reception
terminal hi i'm beth
shooty i'm the managing director of the
ark at jfk
the argud jfk opened on january 2nd 2017
and we comprise 50 employees
jfk is one of three major ports of entry
for the united states the other two are
in
miami and los angeles so that means that
all of the different federal agencies
that regulate
animals are present here at the airport
24 hours a day just as we are to service
any kind of needs with
clearing animals or exporting animals
if we hurry up we might get a horse
good how you doing
so these horses today will be departing
on a flight
to liege and belgium and from there
they could be dispersed all throughout
europe some of them go for competition
some go for breeding
you think about getting on a plane
yourself you know you have to have your
identification and you have to make sure
that you have your luggage and your
security screening
when you're moving an animal it doesn't
typically
move with you unfortunately animals if
they're
being shipped as cargo go in a separate
area of the airplane they have to be
delivered to a completely separate area
of the airport
they have to be screened just as a
passenger would be screened
so when you're dealing with a live
animal you really have to think about
the feeding of that animal the relief of
that animal the um
you know the stress that animals are
placed under
so this is our aviary and
in transit area so they're coming off of
one
flight and going on another and they get
held here
to be inspected by fish and wildlife
cdc if necessary and us department of
agriculture
so counting the number of animals coming
through here is is
a challenge mostly because we go from
very small animals like think fish or
chicks to
very large animals such as horses horses
are much more easy to quantify
this year we expect approximately 4 000
horses to come through this facility
so the jet stalls are over here and
those are where three horses
are loaded into each stall they would be
placed a death stall
replaced on this loader here and after
it's loaded
it gets placed onto our trailers
which are over here for small
animals we estimated somewhere around 10
000 animals per
year and that ranges in size
like i said from small fish to larger
dogs
and more exotic animals
back on the people side of the airport
jfk's passenger terminals are all
connected via the airport's 8.1 mile
long
elevated rail system the air train
the fully automated driverless system
runs 24 7
and consists of three lines that service
10 stations
with connections to the nyc transit
system
while a rail link to the airport was
recommended as early as the late 1960s
the project did not come to fruition
until much later
with construction beginning in 1998
the system opened on december 17 2003
and as of 2019 total ridership was 20.9
million
while the airtrain can take you to any
of jfk's terminals
if you have extra time terminal 5 boasts
a particularly noteworthy attraction
that has
thankfully for us stood the test of time
so the twa hotel is a six and a half
acre mixed use facility
that's physically located at the center
of jfk airport
it's a ground up rehabilitation of
aeroserene's iconic 1962 twa flight
center
the building opened may 28 1962
and operated as an airline terminal up
until
american airlines bought twa in 2001.
they found that they could not use the
building and they handed the keys back
to the port authority of new york new
jersey
and since 2001 the building sat derelict
[Music]
when we started developing the building
very very difficult adaptive reuse
you're in the middle of you're in the
middle of a live airport
it's a landmark interior and exterior
and it's a wildly important building
[Music]
from an architectural standpoint it was
designed and
and built by probably the first
starchitect uh aerosarenin
howard hughes designed the twa terminal
uh to support the lockheed constellation
l-1649 which happens to be a propeller
plane um
the jet age came of age at idlewild
airport in the 1960s
and that brought along jet planes flew
twice as fast
seated twice as many people twice as big
the building was functionally obsolete
the day it opened on may 28 1962.
when you walk into the building itself
you'll notice a few things
one there's no columns and that's
because
structurally it's a marble it's a 66 000
square foot
concrete shell poured concrete that's
held up by four points of contact with
the ground
you just would never get that today
another
kind of really unique thing about the
building there is not a straight line in
this building everything isn't
completely curved
third you'll notice that there is penny
tile everywhere and it's this
beautifully articulated
penny tile the grout was labored over
it's a
modern marble from a visual standpoint
it's this white concrete palace
that you're walking into so i think from
an aesthetic standpoint it just can't be
matched this building is so important
to a lot of different people
[Music]
as the day winds down clouds gather
overhead and a sudden weather cell
envelops the airport
back in the air traffic control tower at
terminal 1
ramp manager steve checks on his staff
mr adams says as a 1622 all ramp
activity has been suspended
you know when we get thunderstorms with
lightning proximity to the airport we
have to close the ramp take all our
personnel
off the ramp all the ground staff off
the ramp it'll obviously lead to delays
in both loading and unloading and it's
usually a cascading effect because once
you get weather like this airplanes one
flight won't fly the approach
so your concern is departures who don't
leave impacting arrivals that won't have
gates but
usually the arrivals are going into a
hold
[Music]
brian is there flat spinning or still
coming in
in the back side of it is
[Music]
the back side of it is probably over
laguardia i mean this will be over in 10
minutes
and then just rain
you know there are times when we get
lines of thunderstorms that stretch from
montreal to atlanta there's no way
around them
this is a short confined cell so if
you're actually you know 70 miles north
of new york you can get to the back side
of the cell and still get here
at the beginning of the pandemic our
airports
were down more than 95 in terms of their
pre-covered
levels as of last week they had
recovered to about 50 percent
of pre-covert levels but we have kept
the airports open during the entire
pandemic
and so we're looking forward to a really
strong return
in the course of the rest of this year
as we
transition out of coven we're doing
everything possible to ensure a safe
experience for the passenger
but ensuring that the passenger has
the opportunity to experience what they
did experience before
jfk is a sprawling complex and we've
only touched the surface here today
have you been to the airport before if
so what else would you like to know
about how it operates
