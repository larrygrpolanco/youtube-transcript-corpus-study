this is Camila one of the largest cities
in Bangladesh with a population of more
than 6 million this Southeastern city
has been always known for its culture
and Heritage but in recent years
tensions between the Muslim majority and
religious minorities have been on the
rise
[Music]
now Hindus are again preparing for their
biggest religious Festival Durga Puja
Menifee the festival could again be the
target of sectarian attacks
foreign
[Music]
has been a Craftsman his whole life in
his Workshop he and his team make Idols
for worshiping
it's just a couple of weeks ahead of
Puja the busiest time of the year for
him
it takes eight days to finish the basic
structure and the clay work
then we need two more days to color it
first we make this background frame with
wood and bamboo then we make an idle
structure with hay and set them on the
frame after that we start the clay work
Paul was the Craftsman who made the idol
at the center of last year's communal
tension a video Hit social media saying
that the Quran had been discovered on a
Hindu deities lab enriched Muslims
vandalized the meship temple and
destroyed the idols Paul made
similar incidents later broke out in
various parts of the country seven
people were killed and dozens injured
it felt very bad what else could I feel
the idol that I made myself was
destroyed we could not even provide the
offerings
that's a matter of Sorrow
we give blessings and pray to the idol
my heart broke
foreign
footage revealed that the Quran was put
there by a Muslim man but by then it was
already too late
we are invited to ratnadasa's house
she lives in a Hindu majority
neighborhood in kumila
she has finished her everyday prayers
and is preparing for the Festival this
year
Festival approaches our hearts fill with
joy
this is our biggest Festival Durga Puja
we celebrate big
we shop for new clothes prepare sweets
and make Feast offerings to God
but this year thus in her neighbors fear
that the Hindu Community could suffer
similar Violence new barriers are being
built a reaction to last year's riots
because of the incident that happened
during the last dogapuja we've built
this gate to protect ourselves from
outside people
on that day we were preparing ourselves
to go to different temples and give
offerings
but at noon a mob came and started
attacking
they came here
the men and women from our area built a
wall
that's why they couldn't break in but
they vandalized the other adjacent areas
foreign whether the gate will really be
necessary and will protect the
neighborhood is unclear but it does show
clearly that many Hindu people in kumila
don't feel safe
ratna and Nipa take us to a nearby
Temple that was attacked and is now
being renovated
they broke in and took out all the
lights
they vandalized the idols and took sound
boxes away
if we don't feel safe in Bangladesh then
we have no value here
many Hindus feel like ratnadas
for decades increasing number of Hindus
have been living the South Asian country
the proportion of them is shrinking day
by day and is now less than eight
percent today more than 90 percent of
people in Bangladesh and Muslims Islam
is the state religion but on the other
hand there is freedom of religion
[Music]
prime minister Sheikh Hasina has vowed
to protect this privilege but religious
fundamentalism is on the rise
the government also blames the communal
tensions in India for feeling the crisis
in Bangladesh local human rights groups
have counted more than 3 000 such
attacks in recent years
Dhaka the capital of Bangladesh
here is the central Hindu temple called
dhakashari
[Music]
thank you
we are received by chandranath bodder a
member of the central Puja organizing
committee and a teacher he tells us that
there are more than 32 000 Puja
celebration sport similar to last year
he says a security threat is not enough
to make them reduce the numbers
we have to survive
to survive just as we have to eat we
also must make people feel strong we
have to do our prayers because they're
part of our lives
that respect we're prepared to host Puja
and I've asked the government to give us
security
[Music]
the authorities say that they are ready
to stop any outbreaks of violence this
year but argue that there is no
organized political or criminal agenda
behind the riots
we don't have proof that these acts are
done with any political agenda or any
organized intentions
but when an incident like the one in
Camilla or elsewhere takes place and it
offends a religious group that incites
some people to mobilize and react
foreign
[Music]
during Friday prayers to find out how
worshipers feel about relations with the
people of other faiths
[Music]
they tell us the relationship is not
hostile
s
Islam says to follow your religion
and if there are people from another
religion do not do anything to harm them
if there's a conflict there are laws and
Judicial Systems to solve it
we want everyone to live in peace
we want to take care of them and they
will also live with us in harmony
but the number of attacks on minorities
has grown recently if there is a rumor
of defamation a violent response often
follows
here in this mosque the clerics preach
about religious cohesiveness
[Music]
we talked to the Head Clary half his
mawlana Mufti Muhammad rahulamin he says
Muslims as a whole are blamed for crimes
committed in the name of religion by
groups with vested interests he wants
the perpetrators of last year riots to
be brought to Justice
the government should ensure that such
incidents do not happen again
they must act
they should keep an eye on these
perpetrators
our message is always the same these
acts are not accepted by religion
religion never teaches people to be
undisciplined
our duty is to spread that knowledge to
everyone
we do that
people who don't follow that and harm
others even if the government fails to
punish them Allah will
see everybody but these teachings don't
always reach the Grassroots
toddler said that there are also many
places in the country where Muslims help
the Hindus to celebrate their religious
Festival but the state is failing to
uphold that Harmony
this is very frustrating that the
perpetrators go unpunished
so they feel encouraged to Stage attacks
one after another
foreign
victims of the riots say they are being
denied Justice while the police insist
that everything is done in accordance
with the law
the reason lies in the law itself
according to Sharia Kabir a journalist
and researcher of communal conflict
based in Bangladesh he says that
Bangladeshi people are generally United
the fundamentalists are taking advantage
by creating these conflicts and on the
other hand the government is not doing
enough
a lot of times the perpetrators get away
because of the old criminal law from the
British period
it requires so many witnesses and so
much evidence that cannot be managed in
many cases
only a very few Trials take place
we've advised the government to form a
national minority commission or pass a
minority Protection Law which was also
in the election Manifesto of the ruling
party
that will at least give the minorities a
little more protection and the
perpetrators can be brought to Justice
adding the finishing touch to the idols
he's hoping that Harmony will be
restored not only for the sake of his
work but for the future of Bangladesh
