tenerife airport disaster
a holiday from hell
the canary islands an all-year refuge
for all those yearning for the sun
for a long time the archipelago in the
atlantic ocean has been attracting
tourists from all over the world
it is the place to be now as it was back
in the 70s
however back then the islands became
known worldwide for the worst disaster
in aviation history
curiously the deadliest aircraft crash
occurred while aircraft were on the
ground
the location of the disaster was the los
rodeos airport on the island of tenerife
aircraft engaged were two boeing 747
airliners belonging to the dutch klm
company and the pan am of the united
states
they crashed into each other on the
airport runway on march 27 1977.
the scale of the disaster was enormous
only 61 out of 644 people on both planes
survived
the disaster shocked the world
it was not only the number of casualties
that was disturbing but also the fact
that two aircraft collided on the runway
such incidents were unthinkable even for
low-level airports such as at tenerife
when the dust settled a question arose
how on earth could two planes collide on
the runway without plane crews or the
air traffic controller being aware of
what was going on
two airliners weren't even supposed to
be at the tenerife airport that day
so it was another incident that actually
led to the tenerife disaster
even though they belong to the african
continent the canary islands have been
part of the spanish kingdom since the
spaniards conquered the archipelago in
the early 15th century
the collapse of the spanish colonial
empire didn't affect the status of these
small islands
in the late 1960s a pro-independence
armed movement disputed the spanish
authority over the islands
the maiac
movement for the independence and
self-determination of the canary's
archipelago based in algeria led an
aggressive campaign to win independence
for the canaries
on sunday march 27 1977
mai ac fighters set up an explosive
device on the grand canaria airport at
las palmas
the bomb exploded at 1315 injuring eight
people
the local police immediately raised the
alarm
a couple of minutes later a person
representing himself as a maiac fighter
reported they planted another bomb
the airport had to be closed
what followed was a complete breakdown
of the air traffic above the canaries
grand canary airport was the main
airport for all the airliners
transporting tourists from all over the
world to the archipelago
however
there was no way an aircraft would be
allowed to land with a bomb on site
so instead
they were all diverted to los rodeos
airport on the nearby island of tenerife
los rodeos airport was a much smaller
airport than gran canaria but was the
nearest one and therefore the best
solution to divert all airliners
arriving to the canaries
on march 27 1977 dozens of planes landed
on those rodeos including five large
airliners
among them were two boeing
planes
klm flight 4805 arriving from amsterdam
and pan am flight 1736 coming from los
angeles via new york
los rodeos was by far an inadequate
airport for these planes but there were
no better options in given circumstances
the tenerife airport had a small apron
area inadequate to park all the diverted
aircraft so almost all of them had to
park on the taxiway instead
they therefore used the runway for both
taxiing and takeoff
needless to say how important was the
coordination of the air traffic control
at the airport in given circumstances
everyone at the airport was quite edgy
controllers in the tower cockpit crews
and above all passengers who were eager
to get to their destinations
the fog that descended on the airport
only aggravated the situation
the pan am
captain didn't even want to land at los
rodeos
he wanted to stay in the air in a
holding pattern and wait for gran
canaria to reopen
ultimately he was forced to land his
boeing 747-121
at the tenerife airport
with his crew on duty for 13 hours
captain victor grubbs was anxious to get
out of los rodeos as soon as possible
most of his passengers were seniors and
spending such a long time in their seats
was too big of a burden for them
as soon as he received a message the
grand canary airport was reopened
captain grubbs prepared his plane for
the takeoff
the problem was that between his
aircraft and the runway was the klm's
boeing 747 flight 4805
with no way to bypass it grubbs had no
options but to wait for the dutch plane
to take off first
at 1656 klm 4805 captain jacob felthus
and van zantin asked the control tower
for permission to taxi
the controller cleared the klm captain
to backtrack down to the end of the
runway and take his position for the
takeoff
in the meantime pan am 1736 also asked
permission to taxi down the runway
they were too clear to backtrack on the
main runway but to leave it on the third
taxiway exit to make room for the klm to
take off
it was an awkward decision because pan
am's captain had to make a 148 degrees
turn to get through the third exit
a complex maneuver for a large aircraft
on such a small runway
once on the takeoff position klm 4805
first officer claus muirs radioed the
tower that they were ready for takeoff
and were waiting for the clearance
the tower responded with the takeoff
route instructions
viewers replaced the instructions and
ended his statement with words
we're now at takeoff
captain vanzanten added we're going
the controller responded with okay but
only to confirm that he received a
message
captain vanzanten however misinterpreted
the word thinking he had got a take-off
clearance he failed to receive the other
part of the message the controller sent
them standby for takeoff i will call you
the main reason the klm 4805 crew failed
to receive this message was that all the
planes at the airport used the same
radio frequency to communicate with the
control tower which led to signal
interference
one of them was pan am 1736 transmitting
a message
we're still taxiing down the runway the
clipper
1736 dutch crew failed to record this
message as well
captain van zantin believed he had an
open runway in front of him pushed the
throttles and began his takeoff while
the pan am 1736 was still on the runway
because of thick fog captain grubbs
missed the third taxiway exit and
continued to taxi down the runway the
controller urged him to report as soon
as he had left the runway as klm 4805
was waiting to take off the crew in the
control tower was utterly unaware that
the dutch boeing was already taking off
they had no ground radars to locate the
planes on the runway and the fog was so
dense that they had no clear sight of
the taxiway let alone the runway
after all they were assured klm 4805 was
in place as they gave captain vanzanten
no clearance
captain grubbs did not know klm's plane
was taking off
he noticed klm's landing lights only
when the dutch plane was rushing at full
speed toward them
captain grubbs just exclaimed god damn
that sfb is coming as he applied full
throttle and turned a sharp left trying
to escape from the runway van zantin was
probably surprised as well when he saw
pan am on the runway he was running too
fast to stop so he tried to lift his
plane and clear over the aircraft in
front of him
but
unfortunately planes were too close for
this maneuver to succeed
klm hit the pan am and ripped apart its
fuselage above the wing and behind the
cockpit
fire immediately caught the pan in
because of the spilled fuel that ignited
remained airborne for a few seconds and
then crashed into the ground 500 feet
past the spot where it hit the pan am
and slid for a further 1000 feet
just before the takeoff the klm was
fully refueled
with tanks full the plane burst into a
massive fire upon impact
back at the control tower controllers
heard a series of loud explosions but
were unaware of what was happening
because the dense fog covered the entire
airport
still firefighters and ambulance crews
were given an emergency alarm
a couple of minutes after the collision
an airport worker came running to report
a plane on the runway was on fire
although unaware of the plane's position
the fire crew jumped into action
as they moved along the runway they
bumped into the klm's aircraft engulfed
by fire
at that moment the fog began to clear
and the firefighters noticed another
bright light coming from down the runway
it didn't last long before they realized
another plane was on fire
the entire fire crew then moved to this
location and concentrated their effort
on putting out the fire on the pan am
the klm was firing so vigorously it was
apparent it was gone beyond saving
in the end both planes burned down to
conditions beyond repair
a devastating fire killed all 234
passengers and 14 crew members of the
klm
the number killed inside the pan am was
even larger
317 passengers and nine cabin crew
members
however 70 people from pan am's boeing
survived the crash including the entire
cockpit crew
of this number nine passengers
unfortunately succumbed to their
injuries later
the total number of 583 killed in the
collision made the tenerife airport
disaster the worst in aviation history
the scale of the disaster asked for
thorough research
a commission of 70 investigators from
spain the united states and the
netherlands including kla and pan am was
gathered
after reviewing the recordings the
commission set up three key questions to
determine the reasons for the disaster
first
why did captain van zantin begin to take
off without the control tower's
clearance
second
why did the control tower instruct
captain grubbs to exit the runway via
the third exit instead of the fourth
exit which was more suitable and why did
grubbs fail to comply with these
instructions
finally why did the klm crew neglect pan
am's message that it still didn't clear
the runway
captain van zantin was the face of the
klm brand their most experienced pilot
and chief flight instructor with 11 700
flight hours of which
1545 hours on boeing
747 investigators found it hard to
believe how an experienced pilot like
him could have made such a mistake
instead they concluded that the
miscommunication with the control tower
led the captain to make a wrong decision
he misunderstood the airway clearance he
was given as a take-off clearance
when the klm crew received the
controller's partial response okay to
their message were now out take off van
zantin opened the throttles and started
to take off
in effect the tower never gave him a
loud and clear takeoff clearance
however if captain grubbs had vacated
the runway through the third exit as
instructed he would have surely avoided
the collision
there are two opinions about why he
failed to do so
either he found the third exit
unsuitable considering he had to make a
sharp turn twice to reach the takeoff
position or he simply failed to notice
the exiting conditions of dense fog
even so captain grubbs messaged the
tower he was still taxiing on the runway
and the klm crew failed to take that
into account when they began to take off
klm's flight engineer however asked van
zantin is he not clear that pan-american
captain simply replied oh yes it seemed
that vanzantin's reputation and
experience in the company were simply
too big to be questioned
after all they probably never even heard
pan am's messages due to signal
interference
in the light of these answers they
blamed captain vanzanten for neglecting
a number of factors that eventually led
to a disaster
the dutch company tried to play down the
spanish report by claiming there were
other factors that caused the collision
they said unfavorable weather conditions
the use of non-standard terminology the
controller's decision to allow two
planes on the runway at the same time
captain grubbs's failure to exit the
runway on time and others too led to
disaster
still
klm had to accept the responsibility for
the collision and pay large
compensations to victims families
the news of the tenerife airport
disaster shocked the world
however it wasn't only the number of
casualties that was terrifying but also
the fact that the disaster could have
been avoided if there had been slightly
better communication between the control
tower and the cockpit crew
the disaster had also disturbed the
entire international airline community
tragedies such as the one at the
tenerife airport had to be avoided at
all costs
the first step the authorities made was
the introduction of standardized phrases
in air traffic communication
for example expression takeoff was to be
used only when the actual takeoff
clearance was given or cancelled that is
cleared for takeoff or cancel takeoff
clearance
they also established english as a
common language and air traffic
communication
changes were brought to cockpit
procedures diminishing the pilot's
authority
first officers and flight engineers were
given the right and were encouraged to
question pilots decisions if they found
them questionable
from then on all the decisions pilots
had to make were in agreement with other
crew members
mistakes caused by a human factor were
something that everyone had to pay
attention to
one word overheard was enough to cause
the loss of hundreds of innocent lives
