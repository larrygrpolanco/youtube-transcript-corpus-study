lobster mac and cheese iron chef bobby
flake even before the food network's
iron chef
there was the french chef welcome to the
french chef
i'm julia child culinary icon julia
child a pioneer in the history of
television we're making the stew of
stews
and a revolutionary in the kitchen
fundamentally disrupting the way
americans viewed and cooked food at home
today we're going to make chocolate cake
and it's a very special
very chocolately
bittersweet lovely cake it was a
wasteland
american food before julia was kind of
pathetic i'm all ready
to make fish julia really introduced
americans to different kinds of food she
had a profound impact on our entire food
culture
well that didn't go very well
now 17 years after her death the life
and legacy of julia child is on full
display in the new mouth-watering
documentary julia
film directing duo julie cohen and my
friend former nightline senior producer
betsy west have profiled some of the
most barrier-breaking women the two
making a name for themselves with their
oscar-nominated documentary rbg we were
looking for another revolutionary
feminist game changer and just like ruth
bader ginsburg julia had a secret weapon
she had her husband backing her every
step of the way what's better than a
husband who's ready to support his woman
in personal life and also in career even
to the point in paul child's case where
his wife has kind of eclipsed him she
married paul child and moved to france
first you need a big soul thick filet
where she had the meal that would change
her life it's absolutely delicate it's
one of the finest things in life
soul munir that first bite igniting her
passion for french cuisine our first
meal in france was just
just a great awakening to me from there
it was off to culinary school at la
cordon blue in paris a discipline
dominated by men
women were treated pretty badly teachers
were all european male chefs
and they'd rather not have women in
their kitchen
most women felt that they couldn't
really have a career making money in
food she was inspired to co-author her
now legendary cookbook mastering the art
of french cooking which has today sold
more than 1.5 million copies
but it's a book that almost didn't
happen finally they complete a draft of
their masterpiece turn it into the
editor the publisher who says uh
no thank you the letter literally says
the american wife might be frightened by
the buy this good book like a cookbook
is going to be frightening in an effort
to spur excitement for the book julia
would alter the course of television i
was a producer director of wgbh the
public television station in the boston
viewing area
she made a proper omelette in a proper
omelette pan that night
and the host was blown away by its
lightness and its taste
and after that was shown they were like
the station got a lot of letters saying
why don't we have a cooking show
the french chef was born you just have
to have the courage of your conviction
there was julia unfiltered and unafraid
to show her bloopers
if she made a mistake she was not
remotely rattled i didn't have the
courage to do it the way i should have
but you can always pick it up and if
you're alone in the kitchen who is going
to see she really was on television as a
middle-aged woman um let's hear it for
middle-aged women
at a time when really women were just
showcases
exactly art pieces
julia was not a particularly remarkable
beauty
she was middle aged with freckles and
her hair changed daily but you were
mesmerized spellbound by what she was
saying she was a groundbreaker defying
the odds and becoming a female
television sensation starting in her 50s
julia never called herself a feminist
although she was clearly really
important to the feminist movement
when i started working with julia we'd
walk into a restaurant to have a meal
then afterwards they'd want to give us a
tour of the kitchen and the first thing
she would say
is
where are all the women how come there's
no women in here she was also unafraid
of controversy because she spoke her
mind when it came to abortion rights she
made the decision to come out very
forcefully as an advocate for planned
parenthood at a time when celebrities
you know celebrity chefs were barely a
thing so that wasn't happening welcome
i am julia charles
it wasn't until she saw the snl skit
that she grasped the magnitude of her
celebrity
now i've done it i've cut the dickens
out of my finger well
i'm glad in a way this happened you know
accidents
julia loved it because she had a good
sense of humor about herself but i think
that a lot of people have that
characterization of julia is kind of you
know loud and a little drunk and you
know kind of crazy woman when pbs tried
to sideline julia after a decade of the
french chef she found a new home in her
80s right here on abc with a new
sidekick dose it with red wine charlie
gibson you're dousing aren't you talking
to charlie was really aghast because he
obviously got such a kick out of working
with julia and he talked about how she
loved to flirt with him and i think he
loved to flirt with her she was the ever
ready bunny she kept going past
everybody else's shelf life what does
that say about her
the thing about julia's longevity on
television she kept getting better
proving yet again that julia was always
the master at shattering expectations
bon appetit bon appetit
