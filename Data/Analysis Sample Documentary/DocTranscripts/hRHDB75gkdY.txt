uh
so
[Music]
is
[Music]
thank you
a lot of folks are wondering what what
happened to fortress
why did it close you know what went on
and
i don't have all those answers
kind of sputtered to a stop in 0304
[Music]
we think it was still making money it
was very popular but it needed a big
capital infusion that they just weren't
willing to do at that time
and this place was
allowed to run into the ground
[Music]
[Music]
so we're heading into the old day lodge
which we think was constructed in
1966-67
this was sort of the center of the
action
kitchen is just off to my left
ticketing off uh over on this side guest
services
but just a
beautiful building
saw some vandalism
and there's been some some folks in here
getting copper out of the out of the
walls and
pulling some of the electrical out
[Music]
this room we understand was the
far side lounge
[Music]
which i guess back in the day was a
pretty happening place
a lot of history in this place
my first experience here was in 1984
it was my first time out of the house
and into
almost its own ecosystem
that was pretty much the inflection
point it was either
med school and brain surgery or
graduate and moved to the mountains and
washed dishes
this whole place was made up of people
who
again just lived and breathed a sport
[Music]
in the 80s
everyone wore the same stuff
if you weren't in sun ice like in the
80s you're nothing
everyone wore that stuff so of course
the snow school here did as well and
they had this sort of
teal blue
which of course you can't be living in
the 80s without teal the kind of people
who would come up here were
ready to get lit
it's the 80s so it's a whole different
scene it's like responsibility meant
something entirely different
my name is rob stevens
and
i am still at my core
a fortress mountain dishwasher
i watched
what i thought was my only opportunity
to build a ski resort fade off into the
distance until fortress came along
we're just
putting the capital together to to build
the lifts in the program to start it up
again
my name is chris chevalier
in the industry i'm pretty much known as
chevy
most people don't even know my real name
i think
so we we don't have a mechanic uh as
such up here so
i'm the head hander of tools and i
usually get the wrong one chris is the
guy with along with michael that does
most of the cat work
it's easy to say reopen a skill
i never would have guessed the
complexity of it going into it
to fill the time between starting that
project and actually realizing it
we decided to start cat skiing
fortress is in canada's country about an
hour from the city of calgary the
biggest thing that catches your eye is
fortress mountain itself
[Music]
for sure
[Music]
the canadian chair which is a triple
chair on the front side was probably the
most modern lift and the backside chair
was a double dopplimer which we actually
want to reuse
number runs
probably about 85 depending on on which
marketing guy you want to talk to
[Music]
me
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
so
i'll go get my stopper and start cooking
i think there's going to be some
chicken and
potatoes
what's your favorite dinner
chicken and potatoes
my full name is melvin
oliver
folded
i have a name type that says mountain
now in my vehicle
when we first met mel he was uh living
in the cat shop here he was sleeping in
a lazy boy chair by the fire and kind of
rigged up a tarpaulin over the fire to
try and keep some of the heat in
when they when they locked the gate and
shut down they tried to to kick him off
the land and uh
you know he'll tell you that he moved
into the cat shop
it was very comfortable
we had the stove to cook on
[Music]
there was no electricity there was no
phone line
so not a lot of
connectivity it was pretty rustic
existence
it went on for uh
probably just about a decade
[Music]
some people would say you know why did
you allow them to stay here and
he's a part of the place well if i win
the lottery and i keep buying the
tickets
i would invest all of it
into this operation
because that's how strong i believe in
it
there is genuinely magic at fortress
you you feel it
i don't know what it is it's like i say
i think there's something
genuinely spiritual about this place
if you have that kind of memory of it if
you take that memory with you
you've left part of yourself here
[Music]
i don't think there's any question that
fortress is going to come back because
so many people
want it to happen
and when you have that kind of energy
focused in the same direction
it just is it just will be
[Music]
good day sir one ticket please
you enjoy yourself a fortress mountain
there cheers thank you very much
welcome to fortress mountain
we're excited to be opening soon
