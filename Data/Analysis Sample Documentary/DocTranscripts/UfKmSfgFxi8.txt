There it is. Can't beat the classics.
Can we just start it already?
He said he'd be right back.
Yeah, but that was like 20 minutes ago. You know he always does this.
We could've played one by now, just kick him!
Alright, we'll do a quick one. Tilted Towers.
No, no, no, wait guys, I'm back. I'm back.
Finally.
What took you so long?
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry about that.
It's okay. Just ready up.
I- I totally will. J- just give me like one more minute.
What?
Are you kidding me?
You know what, just start it.
No no no guys. I swear. I just need one more minute.
I just got to finish something real quick. -Oh my god.
What do you need to do?
Just one - one more second, I swear
Seriously, if we're gonna wait for him one more time I might as well just get off and call it a night and-
Wait wait; shh shh!
What's that sound?
(Clash of Clans sounds are audible in the background)
He's playing Clash.
Oh, my god!
Alright, we're just gonna start.
(From a mic) No guys I'm almost done, I swear!
Everything we've done.
All the sacrifices. The lives lost. The materials.
It all comes down to this.
I know that I may have let you all down in the past.
Well, not this time.
Feels like it's been years since the war began.
Uh, guys?
I can barely remember our days in Shifty Shafts, Greasy Grove, all that time we spent on-
Dude, it's been 7 minutes. We just started.
Yeah. What are you talking about?
We didn't even go to Greasy Grove!
Yeah. Why do you always get so weird when we play this?
That's what separates me from the average player.
What are you doing?
Get down!
This is the kind of mindset you need if you want to make it to the top of the Royale.
Seriously. There's a team out there .
Just crouch!
See, this might seem like some kind of game to you-
Whatever. If he gets knock down, I get his SCAR.
To me, my mind-
What? I have a pistol. You have a rifle.
The best players get the best guns!
Fortnite is a way of li-
Yeah, no, you can't catch bullets in this game.
I know!
Uh... Is someone gonna revive me or... What? We starting over?
Looks like you don't got a gun.
Neither do you.
I guess we both dropped in the wrong house.
I guess we did.
Ahh!
[GASP]
Can you guys see me?
Why would you put that on now?
I dunno. Camouflage?
But we're inside of a house!
Ugh!
See?
[GRUNTING]
Shoot!
Ryan! Boogie Bombs, I got Boogie Bombed!
You've done enough! Ryan, come from the north hole.
Oh! He's coming!
Can we get a shot over here?
Nice shot, nice shot! Come over here now. Revive me!
Damn, you got all of them? Yep. How're you so good at Fortnite, but so bad at PUB-
-Lic restroom cleaning? Yeah, I'm really bad at cleaning those, so...
What? No! I'm talking about why are you so bad at PUB-
-Lishing books? Yeah, I'm no- I'm not a good writer either. So it makes sense.
What? No! I'm talking about PUB-
Can you just stop?
What?
I'm trying to get a sponsorship, alright?
-Oh. So can you please stop shouting out the other one? The V-Bucks don't grow on trees.
Sorry. I just find it weird that you can't even say the name PUB-
Jesus, man!
Where he showed up? on the high ground over there.
(Angelic Choir)
Oh, shoot.
Yeah, we're gonna take some damage. -Yeah, say we keep going. -Well, obviously we have to keep going!
Yeah, I'm just trying to give you some tips, you know. -No, I don't need tips, I-
Well, you-you don't play this game that often so... -What? I've been playing the game more than you!
Almost there.
Yeah.
Oh! We made it!
Finally! I'm super low. You got any heals left?
Nah, you got any ammo you can drop?
No, I don't have anything. We were too busy outrunning the storm.
Damn it!
Alright, iIt looks like there's two left and they're fighting. We should go now.
No no, we got no materials, we're not gonna make it that far.
What? But we have just enough time. We should totally run-
We're wasting time, okay, we gotta do something.
All right. Well, I got one rocket left.
Um... maybe we just shoot the guy behind the tree in the blue field-
Wait wait wait! Unless...
Unless what?
Still got that rocket?
Of course I still got that rocket. What? You thought I shot it while proposing my master plan?
So you still got it then.
Yes!
Alright, you ready?
This is so stupid... we could've made it in by now and you just want to try this dumb thing?
Yeah, pretty much. Let's do it.
Just hurry up already!
Okay, yeah, just shoot it then.
That's what separates me from the average player.
-What are you doing? -Get down!
This is the kind of mindset you need if you wanna make it to the top of the Royale.
See, this might seem like some kind of game to you,
But to me, online,
Fortnite is a way of life.
I did it!
I did it!
Yes!!!
Hey! It's not over yet.
Come on. Look how far he is though. He's not gonna be able to shoot me from there!
And he's not gonna make it into the circle!
-Yeah, there's no way he's gonna make it. -Yeah, he's far!
Fine. But don't go out in the open.
Oh. Don't go out in the open. You mean like this?
Is this in the open or-?
Oh! And do a dance!
Ooh-ouhaha-oh!
Stop!
Nice!
Fine.
How is this guy still alive? You know what?
I'm just gonna grab some bullets and I'm gonna, I'm just gonna shoot him.
Ryan, enough!
You're still super low, remember?
Yeah, maybe uh, maybe hide just a little bit.
You know, for a bunch of dead guy,
You sure have a lot of opinions on how to stay alive.
In reality, I'm the only one who's still-
It's a trap! It's a trap!
I see it. Alright. Look, just because I'm not that good at the game that
you guys play does not mean that I am not good at this game because I-
I really can't believe my victory. I cannot believe you-
Really? Wait, there's only one door here. How'd he leave?
