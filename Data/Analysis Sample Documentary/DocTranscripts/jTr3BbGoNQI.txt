so
many singaporeans choose the norms and
pursue careers in more traditional and
conventional professions
with the beautiful game getting more and
more worldwide coverage many youths
dream of following the footsteps of
their idols
but for many years it's been a game
dominated by men
with the start of the fifa women's world
cup in 1991 and professional women's
leagues starting to be set up around the
globe
women's soccer has been starting to gain
much attraction
but
what about the next generation of soccer
girls in singapore is there a future for
them
good sucker is not only
skill wise
but it is more
how they perform during the game and how
consistent they are
aside from that a good soccer girl is
those who have good relationship with
their teammates or other people and also
the opponent
i have a lot of guy friends who play
soccer with me and they know that i'm
the character of my team
they don't underestimate my potential
and my ability to meet my own team
i think that girls also can play as good
as boys just in terms of their
experiences and their passion over time
after playing with my teammate over the
season playing few games weekly
my teammates make me a better keeper day
by day
well in coaching women's soccer i guess
we have to take a bit of precaution in
terms of physical contact and everything
else
uh restriction i doubt so there's any
because i always told the players that
this is a physical game if i need to
demonstrate anything physical i will
have to and
i
like them to think that i'm being
professional
i actually encourage them to actually be
playing like the boys if they have to
tackle hard they have to
to
go shoot hard and everything else so i
guess restriction and boundaries
is very minimal but i always have to be
aware of it and conscious of it
not only do the girls play soccer
they have also ventured into freestyle
soccer
i started playing soccer since young i
have a love of for soccer
but what makes me do football freestyle
is i have a love for art especially
dance
football freestyle is using all
different parts of your body to control
the ball you have to follow the reader
of the beats and the music and to add on
flow with all your tricks together
how does the public feel about female
soccer players there's always the
potential to
train women to actually be better at
whatever they do it's all about having
the proper training proper
amount of uh knowledge and support from
the community if the girls actually go
out with the boyfriend
she also like to suffer right so they
can enjoy together a point of time
probably they are not really playing
very well i think i mean probably man is
better
and
i think more star actually is i mean in
the world right i mean people knows
people in the world as uh the good
soccer player is a man right not not
really a woman i think they can be
really feminine and you know be soccer
players i think they're just a
stereotype just conventional to watch
men play football because it's been
going on for so long and it's kind of
difficult to like shift everyone to like
you know to watch females playing
football the important thing is to get
the let's call the grassroots sport so
obviously all the youngsters playing so
that you can get competitive leagues
starting right from the beginning that's
the only way that you can be really
competitive when you get to the national
team but so of course there is a future
for that
how many competitions are available in
singapore
and how acceptable are they of female
competitors there isn't really any
ladies competition in asia or singapore
anywhere i'm always competing with the
guy so it's very hard to keep up
but what i think i have achieved is
where am i today
for me it's really not easy being a girl
doing football freestyle there isn't
much support here in singapore let's say
people don't even know like hey ladies
can do football freestyle here in
singapore people like just look guys
doing it but they never thought that you
know girls can actually do it too
for girls and guys stamina wise fitness
wise and
football freestyle is actually very
tiring for you to just juggle the ball
like for like straight if you try like a
minute or so it's actually very tiring
and at the same time you have to do
tricks
so fitness levels wise it's very hard to
go on power with guys so we have to work
extra harder
to be on par with them and it's
really really hard but i believe as long
as you don't give up girls we are good
at certain things that guys are not at
such as flexibility so there are certain
tricks that we can do but they can't so
i think we just have to work
on our strengths
maybe because guys
could play better and they have more
skills and girls i mean girls have
skills but they
don't have skills like guys do
guys soccer are
more well known and usually more people
will come down to watch a guy's match
because they think that a girl soccer
match
is not fun and
and as challenging as you guys met
i feel like
for
my students they are mostly boys to
readers because like what i say this is
not a very known sport or art in
singapore yet like not parents they just
send their kids to like normal soccer
class and for
women's football in singapore is slowly
picking up
the number of
uh kids who are attending are mainly
boys and girls yeah cause this is
actually a boy sport like a male
dominated sport
soccer is indeed a male-dominated game
it's full of stereotyping opinions
will these female players get their
support
i don't believe that girls who cut their
hair short make them lose their
femininity it's just maybe playing
soccer with shorter hair is easier than
with long hair you need to tie tie up
your hair before the game matches
the society the stereotyping keeps
continuing the girls they themselves
don't dare to stand up or when they step
into the spot like
they feel like after like one or two
weeks they feel uncomfortable here like
there's no support there's no growth
everyone needs someone to support them
in whatever they do i'm here to support
her and if she needs help i'll be there
for her to boost up her morning
give us and show her some support that
she needs
sometimes she comes my game but
sometimes she doesn't
so it makes us most rusella she can be
manlier than me but i don't feel
intimidated at all with the girls okay
they
actually
always try to improve themselves even
though they know
something already or when i show them to
do something when i
show them a drill or a technique and
they are always willing to
to take in what i have said and try to
improve themselves rather than the boys
because sometimes the boys get too
carried away they
they actually are quite proud
they they think that they know how to do
this how to do that and everything else
so that's the difference
can female footballers reach up to the
success their male counterparts in
soccer
i was given the
chance to lead the team for polar and
also ivp and i think that is one of the
sweet achievements for me aside from
that i also managed to
get
the most valuable player e4 warriors
award ceremony i would say it's not
impossible to achieve awards
same as those guys
what you need is persistent perseverance
and
that will
definitely bring you to somewhere and
eventually
winning awards is not
something is impossible for us to play
software
my coach actually gave me the captain um
man with my name as a book they give
for me to wear during my matches like
and it makes me feel proud leaving the
team
actually you don't have to bother about
what people say
especially usually guys who say that
they underestimate girls who can't who
play soccer but you know yourself better
and you know you that's your passion
that's what you love to do then just do
it so i will always
encourage them to go as
far as they could but if they decided
not to they wish to pursue
their careers in other things
i wish them well but at the same time i
hope that they learn something from me
when they are here playing their
football don't do this because you want
to achieve this achieve that do it
because you love it
there could be a chance of success for
soccer girls to play at a higher
competitive platform in singapore
but they can't do it by themselves they
need support from football associations
and the general public
if we can make every soccer girl in
singapore say i am soccer girl
proudly without hesitating it's a sign
that the girls have started to make it
wow
huh
