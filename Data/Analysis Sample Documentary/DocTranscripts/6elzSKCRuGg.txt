 
Who is ever going to marry her?
Have you seen the colour of her skin?
Ewww she is so dark
She won't be able to be seen in the dark
Dark skin, Dark skin,Dark skin
Anku!
I have really good news! The boys' family is coming to see you
I don't want to see any boy 
At least listen to me ... meet them just once 
The boy is very nice and he also earns very well
He's a well-behaved boy from a good family
Are you even listening to me?
No, I don't want to listen 
Four boys have already rejected me, FOUR!
Do you have any idea how bad I feel?
It breaks me, mom 
It hurts my soul
I know everything... what you think
You think I don't know?
It's all my fault
Everyone told me not to marry your father 
He's very dark and so your kids will also be born dark-skinned
But I was in love 
Now you have to suffer because of it
Your dad has gone to heaven now...and left us to deal with this
But if we are in this situation now we have to deal with it and you have to eventually get married
What do I tell everyone? My daughter does not want to get married?
Mom, Please stop crying
I'll meet the boys family
