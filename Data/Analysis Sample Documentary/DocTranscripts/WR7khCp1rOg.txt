you ever see that documentary it's old
it's on hbo it's called there's
something wrong with aunt diane
no bro anti-again who's that
uh so she was a lady from
i think they're from like long island
yeah
uh
it's the craziest story in the [ __ ]
world
so
she and her husband
and
their their kid their two kids
and their three nieces yeah were at a
they were like at a campground
the next morning they wake up
he they have breakfast him and his wife
have breakfast coffee together he leaves
drive separate she's taking a van with
the kids home
and then on the way home she freaks out
and drives into oncoming she gets on the
wrong lane of the highway and goes 70
straight down the highway straight into
another car
kills everyone
it makes no sense and then they're like
trying to do this for no reason then
they found a bottle of vodka in the van
and like her blood alcohol was like 0.19
she was [ __ ] hammered and had weed in
her system okay and he they were like
she wasn't a drinker
like this is just it makes no sense as
to why she did this she just lost it
just and they had like a phone call with
her that you you don't have the
recording of it but it's like
she was like incoherent not drunk okay
just like saying different words she was
losing her mind she had like delirium
and like
it's terrifying and there's footage
there's like uh
there's footage of her at like a gas
station just walking in totally normal
not [ __ ] up she's like do you have any
tylenol because she was trying to get a
headache and then walked back to her car
then she was at a mcdonald's and the the
guy that talked to me was like yeah i do
remember talking to her she was
definitely not drunk
and then she chugged a bottle of vodka
and drove
not erratically either she wasn't like
driving a rack she just drove straight
down the [ __ ] highway going 70 into
oncoming oh
rude
it was like one of those and then the
yeah man
then they're talking like the the people
that like saved they're like the kid got
out one of the kids survived there was
kids in the car yeah there was a van
full of kids oh [ __ ] she drove a van
full of kids did she die yeah seat belt
on or no
i think they all got a jack i mean she
was going 70 on the highway into
oncoming traffic like the thing the car
[ __ ] exploded that'd be the first car
i'm like no no no no no
[ __ ] dude yeah but they interview all
the like dudes like they have their long
island accent like there's a [ __ ] van
full of kids down here
like crying and [ __ ] it's so sad
the little boys
kid survived the little boy was like
under a pile of kids
that's how he survived
the burning van
he was like underneath the other kids
yeah people people melt yeah dude
[ __ ]
you you gotta watch this document they
they they were trying to figure out
maybe she had like an abscessed tooth
oh that can go to your brain your brain
up maybe they don't know usually so
immense from a tooth like that you get
like crazy pain first well that's what
they were saying she was like rubbing
her jaw for a while she did have an
abscess tooth she did have okay
uh no like is it possible that that
caused her to like her brain did they
examine her brain
they well the coroners were just like
the autopsy was like all right 0.19
blood alcohol and that's with a belly
full of vodka that didn't
metabolize yet so it would have been
even higher like she just chugged a
bottle of vodka
and had wheat in her system
and like she didn't smoke or drink like
that
whoa it was weird where'd she get her
hands on weed that quickly i mean i
think she smoked like occasionally this
year and there yeah
jesus dude so yeah the weed was
lingering in our system yeah yeah it
happened in the spud man he had an
abscess he didn't drive his van into
oncoming traffic but he had he had he
had an abscessed tooth and he got like
horrible pain he went down there like
dude if you waited this would have
[ __ ] killed you
because it'll go and infect your brain
unreal
that's weird watch the documentary
though it's like i know someone who had
a well i mean that's the whole
documentary i know someone who had a
brain they don't solve it i know someone
who had a brain tumor yeah and like got
involved in like a big scandal
and then through the scandal ended up
going to a doctor and finding out he had
a brain tumor so that's why no one
really knew like what happened yeah
they're like was this the brain tumor
that started this up are you a piece of
[ __ ] yeah i mean it was the moves he
made i thought were pretty [ __ ] sick
but you know how to discuss the moves i
mean i gotta discuss him it was
basically like you know
he it was like he was with he had a wife
and they like there was some infidelity
that happened he had like a whole he was
like a road like doing like road dogging
for like business but i think i like
consuming stuff he was slinging dick
slinging dick out on the road so he had
like a work babe and then his uh his his
wife was like dude what the [ __ ] she
checked the credit card and saw he's
buying his work bait credit like stuff
and they were he was like kind of
embezzling money from a company and
buying his side piece money so he was
frauding the company to pay for his side
piece baller all right so this is sick
[ __ ] this is the man this is not the
tumor dude it's a man and it was like we
like
i wasn't a big fan of his marriage in
general so this dude got
delighted with this i heard this and i
was like i knew he [ __ ] had it it was
great but then he went something
happened where like he went they checked
the brain took it out and now he's just
dude just chills you know chills with
his new bae sick great light it was a
great i think his tumor his baby might
cause a tumor wow you think it's bad
next brain protected itself it was just
like
i can't keep hearing it another brain
grew and was like i got a [ __ ] plan i
got a way out of this dude yeah it was a
baller [ __ ] move
full support
um
another documentary i just wish you
might
like
actually you'll definitely like it it's
on hbo it's about the girl who texted
that dude into killing himself oh i
heard about that so [ __ ] funny bro i
heard about that the the the prosecutors
like the way they tried to frame it was
like
they brought in all of her high school
friends to be like she was an attention
[ __ ]
everybody hated her her [ __ ] friends
hated her they brought her her friends
from high school onto the stand and they
were like did you have any intention of
hanging out with her this summer
and they're like
no
no your honor i did not like her like
she had all
that's how the state tried to prosecute
her they brought in her friends she
sucks no she was a loser
it's like they're like she sucks enough
to have done this i mean she was a
complete she was a [ __ ] weirdo but it
was interesting because the kid
also was texting her forever that he was
going to kill himself yeah
so one day finally she was like yeah you
should kill yourself
but
there's no law against that you can text
people whatever the [ __ ] there's no
there's no murder for texting someone
what do they give this lady she got
[ __ ] manslaughter what yeah bro but
wasn't she like kill yourself for me
no she was like
he got out of the car while it was
running and she was like stop being a
[ __ ] get back in there and he did it
what but he had told her for like
two years he was going to [ __ ] kill
him but they did all the time
it was long they were like texting
all day every day that's it that's sick
and twisted dude it's wild man
she becomes a cute bae too she was a
little chunky in high school
pro posts like all this clear like
depression anxiety she's pretty hot i
like it she's got a very when she gets
out you would hate her look why
very she looks like a classic wasp [ __ ]
you would hate that i like that's my ant
she looks like a real [ __ ] dude if
she feels like that's who tells people
to kill themselves she would text me and
be like you should kill yourself we
should have connor dated and i know
connor jack her up on the yacht dude
her versus o'connor
he would be dead in a [ __ ] i think he
would kill himself pretty quickly bro
he's close already he thinks so i gotta
i gotta i push him i i push him i might
get charged with the same thing you call
him everybody i call him every day just
kill yourself dude you should think
about killing yourself and they'll
interview you and like [ __ ] happy
like he was really mean to me
yeah if things weren't going well for
him he really took it out on his closest
whoever's the closest to him
in proximity he'll swing it damn dude
yeah this lady is dude you got us you
gotta watch it it's actually really fun
that sounds [ __ ] awesome but they did
that i mean the defense and they all
have this like boston accent that took
place up there so they're all like your
honor there's no law against this you're
honest she's just texting him he's just
telling him
tell me if you pick up on it if you
watch it her attorney
he's trying to [ __ ]
really probably did he loves this girl
prove it bro [ __ ] kill exactly he
should kill himself that she didn't say
for me she just said kill yourself
but she did set herself up to be like
she was like the the the prosecution did
a really good job of being like she did
this for attention
and she did it was weird she did a lot
of stuff she did she had like a did she
go on facebook charity baseball game for
him in her hometown in her hometown not
his
which
it just was all about her what do you do
with that
that's just this is i mean dude this
i mean that [ __ ] back in the day you
would be able to just kill someone for
you're like look we don't mean loss for
this yeah this sucks so bad the [ __ ]
documentary did that dude they were like
they had this one psychiatrist
psychologist on there was like
he had like the exact accent you would
think for this he's like men are afraid
of women
they have been forever like he's like
taught he's like men are afra men fear
women yeah like there used to be witch
trials for this type of thing he's like
men deep down are horrified of women
this is a this is a witch hunt it's
basically what he like
they tried to claim like sexism yeah
it's like no because if this was a dude
we'd be coming down way harder obviously
i'd be crushed there's like a cute girl
that's getting prosecuted i'm just
sitting there like no free her for here
let her go dude she's mine well that was
uh then this is i think i said it wrong
before but i was saying that was spuds
that's what i thought his theory was if
like tulsi gabbard had to debate trump
old dudes wouldn't want to see trump
being mean like a hot young chick they'd
all kind of intrinsically want to kind
of defend her
dog yeah exactly right
looked like everybody's wife and they
were like yo [ __ ] her finish her dude
god finally someone tells this [ __ ]
just shut up
but yeah that was i think i
misrepresented it at the one time and
he's not exactly right his theory was
that
america is like dudes aren't going to
want to watch
like a hot young woman
get like chastised and derided they're
going to happen they're instinctually
like how about you [ __ ] take it easy
with jerseys
kind of [ __ ] happens with jerry's a
lot too like oh
crying on the stand or something the
jury's like oh we believe her
put a bunch of 45 year old fat chicks up
there dude
right it should be the she'll be tarred
and feathered she immediately yeah
they'd bring that back
put her in the stockade
for sure they uh
they went no jury
the judge
no the the girl wanted no they wanted to
know jerry because they were like it was
smart too because the guy the lawyer was
like there's no crime yeah you can't
make up a crime retroactively what she
did wasn't illegal couldn't they do like
a like a landmark case kind of thing
yeah but you can't do that you can't
just decide something's illegal during a
case like that i feel like that could be
negligence on some way because it's like
you could you could argue this is a
mentally ill person and you're
she's mentally ill
true yeah both mentally both and also
minors
oh god yeah she's a minor what was it
would they interview her parents at all
no they were there though you see them i
really think they're
but yeah it's like so she was throwing
like
he the full [ __ ] did she say like my
boyfriend killed himself and i want to
like yeah she was doing facebook
facebook posts of like i'm so [ __ ]
sad oh my god i miss you so much like
all that stuff about him she was getting
the likes dude
what the [ __ ] she's doing exactly how
many likes you get
not many i think she was kind of a loser
people didn't like her
that sucks imagine that i like her i'm
gonna dude if things go well if things
go well career-wise i am gonna try to
date her hey dude that is bae that's the
new kardashian
me i'm gonna find a [ __ ] i forget her
name i gotta find her name
me and this bae are gonna be together
that's a new kardashian dude i'm gonna
start writing her now do it i can just
force like
this link she's in jail now i might send
this link to her be like peep the cast
just get a new test get into it put some
money on her books and get her a cell
phone
well how long have you she's in jail for
not long yeah she'll be honest two years
three years it should be out just in
time for me to be like come on babe
happy birthday i got a place for i got
places to go with you and me oh
i think i'd be a pretty easy target to
talk into suicide so
it took me a second to think about it
all it would take would be like one
conversation i'd be like yeah i guess so
you would call her i'm like i don't know
i'm just kind of stressed she's like
yeah what uh what floor are you on right
now yeah what
it's like i heard falling doesn't hurt
that bad
yeah it would be easy too for like
michelle carter dude me and michelle
carter are gonna be in love especially
as a dude hit like their 40s and 50s the
chick could pretty easily talk you into
killing yourself
yeah
that'd be tough
conrad roy dude i forgot she went
short-haired on this
what do you mean
michelle cut her hair i don't like it
oh man i forgot how crazy her face was
who cut her hair
look at my bed dude
damn what do you think of bae she has
like wasp [ __ ] face just like draco
malfoy she does she absolutely is
slytherin
he is slytherin dude
you don't like her i don't know i mean
what she did is kind of hot talking to
dude into killing himself then taking
all the
oh my god dude yes
i mean i like what she's about
for suicide and then reaping all the
benefits
for suicide then getting online and
being like i'm so sad life's so hard
i'm so hard it's hot
that's hot dude i can get into that
i can get into the deprivation of it all
she's so sad now is she
do you think me and michelle carter are
gonna date for a while for sure
that dude you could really brighten her
day
like everyone makes mistakes we all make
mistakes you sent a bunch of bad texts
i mean how was the thing the guy was
constantly gonna [ __ ] kill myself for
a while for like a yeah and she would be
like no definitely don't definitely
don't like all the time so what was the
switch
uh
i don't know
the [ __ ] psychologist who is clearly
[ __ ] defending sure came up with some
good answers
yeah
she was in a delusional state also and
thought she was helping
could be
slightly and then she was like i might
as well reap all the benefits yeah then
it's like she sure snapped out of it
right away
dude i uh this is becoming this is about
my favorite time of year man it's cold
the base dude i was laughing the other
day like the cold days i'm thinking
about having babies bundled up
that and how like watching my favorite
thing i i think around the same time
this year i was talking about this dude
baez walking to work early in the
morning and how do just like feminism
does not exist before noon dude oh man
you catch a bae in like 42 degrees
walking to the bus or walking to work
they're just yeah mean mugging just it's
like a [ __ ] eagle beak dude they're
just walking around
yeah dude like a dude could literally at
seven a.m fly a helicopter down and like
get in you [ __ ] [ __ ] and they'd be
like all right fine i'm in i mean [ __ ]
this yeah the dude was like a hawaiian
flower necklace was like get in [ __ ]
yeah historically bays aren't ready for
this
this is a new this is a new we're we're
chatting on some new territory here
sending bays to the work workplace it is
it's a new experience peterson got
crushed when they were like well you're
saying men and women can't work together
he was like
it hasn't been demonstrated we don't
know yet it's okay to find out it's very
new people are like how dare you uh
native american uh men farmed
and women hunted yes like
you saw that dude what was the point of
that dude it's it's
i i really think too it's like
especially with like pregnant women like
why aren't you trying to [ __ ]
distract me from michelle carter and me
well we're just all the same
this is all the same michelle bundled up
on the way to work pro give her a kid
dude i will me she she'll raise my son
bundled up to work where the [ __ ] is she
gonna get a job have you any prior
convictions but actually yeah i was
featured on a documentary yeah you can
catch me on hbo yeah
those are her credits she's got better
credits than me what's up what's up with
that lady remember the lady who killed
her kids or was like accused of killing
her kids a while back
everyone hated her and like she kept
being found out like partying and stuff
casey anthony casey and he killed her
daughter yeah she's she's
she's a she's a bad girl she's a looker
i i do like her i like the way she
handled what's good with her they let
her out of the news she killed her kid
and then went out and like partied for a
while yeah like she was out like seeing
like like a weekend after like laughing
at a bar having a good old
dude the guy who got a picture of her
having a good old is so funny dude she's
probably at like a regular like tiki bar
out in the suburbs she's got hamilton
she's down to florida
she's in florida girl this is the
sunshine state you can't how are you
supposed to be sad even let's say your
kid dies you live in florida dude go out
and catch some rays have fun man you're
out to the [ __ ] she's gonna have some
fun she's at the pf chang's outdoor bar
having a laugh
she like started dating right away too
yeah i mean she clearly killed her kid
she clearly was unburdened and free yeah
that's the sickest of the sick
did you hear another uh
another duck boat accident hit
in missouri yeah yeah 17 dead dudes yeah
philly had we had our own little duck
boat problem
people are still going out on them
i love dog boats i've never been on one
i mean i don't know if i trust them
anymore
there's been a lot of duck but it's like
definitely not the leading cause of
death in america but it's like it's up
there it's about thirty four dollars
as far as modes of transportation go
you're very likely to die on a duck boat
well i'd say you should just
keep cars out of water in general
there's a good chance if you drive a car
in the water whether it's duck whether
it's an amphibious vehicle or not your
kids are in the back seat and you just
roll it into a lake that too you're a
mom i wonder if they thought they just
their vehicle was amphibious
those those moms those distraught
mothers
man that's so [ __ ] up that's the
gamble you take with the chick man
she might kill your kids
true there's a lot of talk like every a
lot of stand-up comedians like have
jokes like we trust men not to kill us
because that's the leading cause of
death it's like yeah well we also trust
you guys to we leave you alone with our
kids and you might drown them and you
might toss them in the microwave you
don't have dads doing that dude
well they beat them
dads will [ __ ] the kids dad's got a
whole other that don't make love to the
kids dad's got a whole other agenda but
the [ __ ] [ __ ] fight i'm not saying
dads are perfect
they might play a secret game they might
play the secret game women for some
reason just i don't i don't know what
that is they might play tickle monster
they might play ticket monster dude but
mom mom's playing
you know hold your breath hold your
breath yeah baptisms were originally
what you hold someone underwater and to
the point where they're about to pass
out and then you bring them up you'd
give them a near-death experience and
pop them out of the water really who
told you that
uh just an audiobook i was listening to
about lsd therapy no big deal
