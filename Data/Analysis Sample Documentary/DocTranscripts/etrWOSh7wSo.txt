- [Narrator] This is a typical
European underbrush scene,
home of the water shrew.
This tiny rodent, one of the
smallest mammals on our planet,
forages around the banks of streams
constantly in search of food.
It has a heartbeat rate of 300 per minute,
therefore, everything it does
seems to us to happen
at a very rapid pace.
It's springtime, the mating season.
The scent of a nearby female
shrew catches his attention.
In fact, she's pretty close by.
But he's not alone.
Another male has exactly
the same intentions.
When their paths cross, a
fierce battle is inevitable.

And it's all over in a matter of seconds.
However, let's take a closer
look at what really went on.
