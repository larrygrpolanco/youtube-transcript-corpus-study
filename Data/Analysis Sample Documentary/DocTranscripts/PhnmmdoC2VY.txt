nordvpn more about that later on
in the same year that a reactor in the
uk satellite
another fire in the nuclear industry
took place in the rocky flats plant
in the u.s the event would go on to be
relatively unknown
until another fire at the same site was
discovered 10 years later
[Music]
september 11th is a date that has become
part of world history
however today's subject isn't the 9 11
that normally springs to mind
instead a fire in a glove box in a
plutonium process
building will be the focus for this
video i'm going to rate today's subject
matter here on a plainly difficult
disaster scale
located in golden colorado around here
on a map
the rocky flats plant is situated on 384
acres
inside a 6550 acre nature reserve
ground was broken in 1951 for a new site
to build
vital parts for the budding nuclear
weapons industry in the united states
the construction work in a pittsburgh
press article was estimated to cost
around 45 million dollars
the aec appointed dow chemical company
as the plant's operator
between 1952 and 1975.
the main goal of the site was to produce
plutonium pits which form
part of the trigger to an atomic bomb a
pit is a hollow plutonium sphere that is
imploded creating an explosion that
triggers the rest of the weapon
the demon core was a plutonium pit
however it wasn't hollow but instead had
two spheres with a ring in the middle
the site produced its first pit in 1953
and over the remainder of the 1950s
would grow to
27 buildings the facility manufactured
most of the triggers for the u.s atomic
weapons stockpile
that was until 1993 when production was
abruptly ended
the pits were formed from plutonium
buttons which looks pretty much how it
sounds as seen here from buttons the
plutonium was formed into the hollow
sphere needed for weapons production
via foundry and machinery work although
a vital part in the weapons production
process
rocky flats was only a link in the
manufacturing chain
as once the pits were created they were
sent off to the pantex facility near
amarillo texas
not only did the facility deal with
plutonium but also uranium and beryllium
as well as a myriad of chemicals
including carbon tetrachloride
used as a cleaning solvent in the
manufacturing process
the production buildings did not have
fire suppression systems due to the risk
of criticality instance
caused by water forming a moderator but
instead buildings were fitted out with
little combustible material as possible
and this seemed to work in a 1955
chemical explosion
which was effectively dealt with this
brings us on to september 11th 1957
and building 71 which was used in the
process for pit creation
as a side note building 71 was the first
production building at the site
room 180 contained glove boxes used to
protect operators from the radioactive
isotopes
some at rocky flats were up to 20 meters
in length with multiple lead line gloves
used to manipulate the tools needed for
machining and forging
the boxes were made of stainless steel
had reinforced plexiglass windows and
had
benelex shielding made of wood fiber and
plastic to protect
operators from neutron radiation
extraction fans were provided to vent
air from the glove boxes
to prevent any release of radioactive
dust multiple filters are provided
on route for any material before it goes
to building 71's vent stack
the ventilation system was equipped with
heat sensors which were intended to
switch off the fans preventing the
spread of a fire
which is great however this had been
disabled due to false trips slowing down
production
plutonium can be a fire hazard if
handled incorrectly
or not stored in a dry environment if in
too high of a humidity room the
plutonium can form hydrides on its
surface
which are pyrophoric and may ignite in
air at room temperature this risk
increases when the material is finally
divided
for instance in dust such as spontaneous
combustion can be a deadly event
with the potential to release
radioactive particles at 10 pm
this such incident began as a small
amount of plutonium
turnings spontaneously combusted
spreading the fire along the plexigrass
ten minutes later the fire was
discovered the cooling fans were powered
up to protect the firefighters from
contamination
as they attempted to use carbon dioxide
to quell the flames
however this spread the hot plutonium
dust into the filtration system
something that the heat sensors should
have prevented however this was disabled
plutonium burns in a similar fashion to
charcoal however the smoldering was a
perfect ignition source for the highly
flammable plastic within the glove boxes
after this failed and faced with an ever
building up fire
the firefighters used something that
they really shouldn't have been using
when dealing with plutonium
and that was water at 10 38 pm right
it's time to talk about this video

nordvpn now if you look up various
disasters and atomic incidents like me
then a little bit of anonymity is pretty
handy
needless to say that if i didn't have no
vpn and i know data logging i might be
on some kind of disaster warning watch
list
i've used several vpns over the past
couple of years and have enjoyed the
protection they afford
and i think nordvpn has the best user
interface making it really easy to jump
from one server to another
you can also bypass region locking for
movie streaming sites
which is an annoying part of living in
the uk as you miss out on so many great
shows
it's really been a lifesaver during
lockdown while i've watched more than my
weight of true crime documentaries
also in all vpn you can gain access to
the eu-only sites
such as databases and archives which
thanks to the gdpr rules aren't
available
in northern america for me it's really
good
as using norvpn has allowed me to
research on us-only sites

thank you for listening to the advert
although it initially stopped the flames
which were from the burning plastic and
other flammable materials inside the
boxes
the moisture reached the plutonium
increasing its heat there was also a
massive risk to achieving a criticality
accident
as a water would help sustain the chain
reaction the air filtration system
itself posed risk
as the heat and moisture spread upwards
by the fans
ever since building 71 was first pressed
into service the filters had not been
replaced and were filled with plutonium
dust
which was much more susceptible to
moisture a minute after water was
introduced
a loud blast was experienced the force
bent the plenum steel frame
in doing so spreading the fire into the
filtration system
the explosion also destroyed the cap at
the top of building 71's smoke stack
on order of the health physicist
supervisor everyone evacuated the
building to escape the plutonium
contamination
which by now had spread throughout
building 71.
at 10 45 pm fire was now discovered in
the vital filter banks on the second
floor
the only thing preventing widespread
contamination of radioactive particles
released from the fire as the fire
burned contamination spread out from the
damaged smoke stack
engulfing the surrounding area at 2 am
the fire was declared knocked down
however it wouldn't be completely
stopped until 11 28 am
on the 12th of september it was
estimated that around 63 kilograms of
plutonium was present in room 180 at the
time of the fire
with 13 to 21 kilograms being involved
directly
it was estimated that around 500 grams
of plutonium 239 and 240
was released into the atmosphere however
due to the lack of proper monitoring
and almost immediate cover-up these
figures are an educated guess at best
the contamination was spread by winds
and sun was deposited in the soil
the material is dangerous once ingested
due to plutonium being an alpha particle
emitter
the highest risk of exposure of the
local population was the persons who
were exercising
or were working outside in areas where
the plume of plutonium particles was
near the ground
however some of the most at risk were
the firefighters who for nearly 13 hours
were exposed to the deadly plutonium
the highest dose was estimated to be 50
milligrams off site
the blaze heavily damaged building 71
necessitating the installation of an
incinerator in 1958
to dispose of the amount of contaminated
material
elements such as strontium-90 and
cesium-135
were detected as a result of the fire
hinting at a criticality event
however officials denied that such event
had occurred
the public wouldn't be aware of the
incident for just over a decade until a
second fire
also involving plutonium was fought also
using water
the only reports of the incidents in
local newspapers claimed that no one was
injured and no release of radioactivity
was recorded
and the damage costs were estimated to
be around fifty thousand dollars
the cleanup of building 71 started as
soon as the fire had ended
work resumed on a limited scale before
the end of 1957 but cleanup efforts
would be continued
all the way until early 1962. the
building would be pushed back into
service being renamed 771
with the whole site continue to produce
plutonium pits until 1993 when
production was transferred to oak ridge
national laboratory
this was only after the site was raided
by the epa and fbi in 1989
after numerous reports of staff relating
to deadly working conditions
really the incident in 1957 is only
scratching the surface
of his radioactive dumpster fire of a
place now don't worry i'll be doing
another video soon about the 1969 fire
and its wider impact on the site and
also
rocky flats ultimate demise a big thank
