what's up everybody my name is jesse
cervantes i'm a filmmaker and today i'll
be teaching you how to film a short
documentary
we'll be going over seven basic
fundamental steps that i use
when i film i'm going to keep this to
the point and short so if you do have
any other questions please comment below
this is going to be shot in the
documentary style rule of thirds so you
can kind of get a feeling
of what the documentary is going to look
like
so this can be a bit challenging
sometimes it's hard to find an idea that
you want to film
or what you think others will want to
watch what you will come to find out is
you just have to find somebody who does
something interesting
it doesn't have to be a famous person a
pro athlete
among other successful people everyone
has an interesting life and the best way
to find a visually compelling story
is to think about the b-roll what are
you going to show
visually to help propel the story in the
direction you were looking for
this could be a really fun part go watch
a bunch of short documentaries
you can do a simple search on youtube or
vimeo's website to find
different documentaries on vmail's
website you can break down exactly what
videos you're looking for
by going to watch categories documentary
people and then on the left hand side
there's a filter to select
films under four minutes there are
hundreds of these films that you can
watch and gather ideas
for how you want your short film to look
this could be anything from story
structure
to angles unique perspectives among
other things
remember you are here for inspiration
and not to plagiarize other filmmakers
work
you must think about how you're going to
conduct the interview before you start
filming
figure out what the beginning middle and
end looks like
this could be as simple as you are or as
complicated as you want
here's an easy story structure starting
the film with their name
and what it is they do for example hi my
name is jesse cervantes i'm a filmmaker
and designer living in salt lake city
utah
once you get that talk about what it is
they do why are you filming them
what they want to accomplish how they
got into this field what do their
friends and family think about what they
do
what are their parents like this could
all be things for the middle section of
the film
and you can end with a simple what are
your plans for the future
a more intricate film could start out
with the main emotional point that came
when you interviewed your source this
could grab the audience attention
and keep them hooked to watch for the
entire video
this is where the rule of thirds comes
into play your source is not going to be
staring into the camera
just like me right now there will be
talking with you the camera will be off
to your side
if you only have one camera take some
time to set set
up the shot and pay attention to how
much of the source's face you can see
if the camera is set up close to you you
can see more of the face
and the angle isn't as extreme if the
camera is further away from you
you may only see one side of the
source's face also make sure the
distance from the camera to the source
isn't too close or far away depending on
what focal length your lens is
take some time to set up your shot and
you should be fine
lighting is very important to give your
source depth if you don't have lighting
set up it's best to put your source
close to a window
if there are blinds you can adjust them
and get the right amount of light
intensity on your subject
there are plenty of good lighting
tutorials that i will link below
there are plenty of different angles
movements
and objects to film get creative don't
only film the source from one distance
get close film their hands their feet
face
among other things this helps to keep
the audience in tune with the film
keeping it interesting and exciting
there are a few different angles you can
get when filming
what i do is get multiple angles of the
same shot
that way during the editing process i
have multiple angles to choose from to
help propel the story in the direction i
want to go
[Music]
movements should be kept to a minimum
unless you have a stabilizer or gimbal
to keep the footage smooth
if you do have a gimbal or stabilizer
there are a few different movements you
can do
audio is crucial for getting your
documentary right if the audience can't
hear what the source is saying
or if their mic is rubbing up against
their clothing you're going to have to
refilm
always have a backup use two mics when
you're recording
and this could save you a lot of
headaches music is also a great way to
keep the audience's attention
make sure you are using music that fits
with the style of film you are making
this is a big one talk to the person
before the interview and get to know
them a little
tell them a little about the filming
process most people are not used to
being in front of a camera
and let them know you can edit the film
if they need to repeat themselves
because they lost their train of thought
make sure they know to repeat the
question the audience needs some context
behind what they're saying
for example if you ask them what is your
favorite color
make sure they say my favorite color is
blue versus just saying blue
it gives the audience an understanding
of what is going on
because you will not be in the film only
they will
so editing can be a whole video on its
own and i may do a video in the future
but just make sure you're using your
b-roll to cover up any a-roll cuts
while also using the b-roll to propel
the video
short films can be a long process
they're always worth it though
every situation is different you might
have access to your source for a day or
maybe they're close to your location
and you have access for weeks make sure
you're using the most with your time
and gathering as much film as you can
during the time you have
one film i produced involved the
sculptor she threw clay and then had to
fire the clay
there was no other way to complete this
film than doing it over a few weeks
and filming the whole process along the
way you may run into problem
once you start editing a shot that
doesn't quite look right or a sequence
that doesn't feel
smooth the best solution is to re-shoot
if possible
