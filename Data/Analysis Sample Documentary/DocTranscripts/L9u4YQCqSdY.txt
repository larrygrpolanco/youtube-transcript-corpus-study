last let's talk about uh the BC
documentary on TB Joshua uh most of uh
Revelations are coming out after his
death that he was an ult te leader he
raped and did all sorts of things what's
your take
unfortunately it's a disgrace to um an
institution a media institution
establishment like BBC to come out with
such nonsense does not make any sense at
all they have not been close
to whatever ytic or means they have used
to carry out such a documentary is
unfortunate how many times have They
Carried documentary on the P that said
man should marry
man alone is a very simple thing they
should leave the man alone but is it
Joshua that collap his house that t
Joshua used want to collapse he start
building that
K the government took him to
court somebody who has added value to
humanity then after how
many years of his death so to say they
coming up with a documentary that is uh
this and that that and make confessions
bro let me tell you a lot of sabotage
can
happen people can blackmail
anybody Jesus Christ of Nazareth was
also
blackmailed I have on two occasions have
relationship with t josua i i not be
talking too much but when I see
something you understand I'm able to
understand one of two
things
initially the media thought that t
Joshua was antic man initially yes when
he came up with
[Applause]
synagog but people that know him from
the scratch knew
him until people begin to have access to
him people begin to unveil him people
begin to discover him this is a man that
spent
12 months in his mother's belly before
he was
born
Destiny he has a date with
Destiny he's a man that God has destined
for what he did no two way about it
saying he died at a a relatively young
age no matter what what the most
important thing is that what are the
legacies you left
behind it is not half far it is UN well
cation has transformed so many lives
more than the
BBC the BBC report that inducted
we what is the end of it now the same
BBC
report BBC report that carried a fake
report on be
France BBC report that Carri a fake
report BBC I sure it is BBC Nigeria not
BBC London no that is just the truth I
am sure that this BBC is BBC Nigeria not
BBC
London that is just the truth of course
it should be BBC ner because what do you
expect you know there was issue of
leadership pu when T Joshua died and a
certain cabal wanted want a to take over
power take over the Church
administration
those people can bread their
way to Blackmail anybody who tells you
that at least one or two occasions I
have found myself to
synagogue yes and I that publication the
BET of greatness go and check it on
magazine it was circulated
everywhere the bet that the title they
have Joshua on the cover the bir of
great I do a
aor right up
investigative report it was not in good
ter KH let me tell you you know
Christian body Niger know let me tell
you that is not the truth the truth
remains
this for instance
please
K LOVE World Christ
Embassy look at how he started his
father was a father a pastor in one
maybe Apostolic Church another but right
right from the time CHR was in
ABA from year one he preaches the gospel
throughout his years in that
University he has a he has a
call see
they asking him who anointed you that's
the problem who is your god spiritual
Godfather that's the
problem that is why they saw what he was
doing was
extraordinary because him too is
extraordinary if I tell you this a lot
of things I know about t Joshua when he
started that Ministry how he started
that Ministry in
you will not believe because I remember
that time I used to come from East I
used to do business at Broad Street
Legos
there I stay
at I have a house somewhere
at so most times my business partner is
at I used
to you
know cast I used to pass through that
Asis I used to notice this man on daily
basis fasting and praying with without
without no how no
block continuously he will tell you that
consistency brings
Freedom they don't need to listen to
what what people are saying we know the
name they call Jesus Christus person was
alive even some Pastors in Nigeria today
he to call their
names so I'm not surprised
Nigeria can do come up with such a thing
for someone who has contributed
immensely to the development to tourism
sector of Nigeria why that was and
not I've not seen
anyone
male or
female yes they will come out I said
that t rap
me going to
Joshua he's always in the
mountain he's always
playing so I want to say it is
unfortunate on the side but I'm not get
like BBC should come up with such a a a
a a a documentary a blackmail against a
a reputed man of God I respect T Joseph
very much I believe in his ministry I
believe in his calling I believe that
God has Ed him for
that
call and he ran it and did
well the question is is it coll is build
building coll coll
it we know what
happened this some of this is we you
know is
conspiring BR let me tell
you there is
no sector
institution
office that is
people
anybody to bring something
down I want to tell you this but even T
Joseph was still alive he has
enemies KH was number
one Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria
they were they were among to question
this josua that the government of
Nigeria we
celebrating having contributed so
much to
tourism what yes I met I met three South
Americans
pastors we are in the same L
inside tbj synagogue that day we
interacted for over 1 Hour 2
hours three Sou
American
pastors one of them was representing the
whole Southern America he was there for
two hours we were deliberating
on how T Joshua is going to attend a
crusade in South
America if T is not genuine God wouldn't
have taken him to that height he T lives
all over the world there's no continent
today there are certain issues between
nations and
Nations elections problem has attended
to so
many I'm not saying that there are no
challenges Jesus Christ also has his own
challenges but the bible say that they
can never buy any means consum us or
come near us and that is just the truth
Joshua is a true man of God I say I'm
saying
it you know why if you go to his church
it does not say in the name of devil be
healed he says in the name of Jesus
Christ be
healed and the bible say that those that
call upon their name of Jesus Christ
shall be saved thank you very much
accusation labeled against T Joshua none
has been legally
proven legally proven is that nobody has
taken T Joshua to court is all side
talks
accusations imaginations fictitious
stories that we have not been able to
confirm one fact out of them all
Confessions by some people see
confessions were being made in those
days when Joshua was alive they said
said this am said this one Ghana woman
said this I read online I watch online
are you listening to me say during the
church days Church week week days I see
TV Joshua doing his program
Nigerians within without members of the
World Europe Asia America other part of
the country Oceania anarctica trooping
to Synagogue Church of all Nations I
said to myself all these confessions
against TB Joshua why are these people
there they move on Convoy you see wh
white men coming and nobody has been
able to prove it that t Joshua was a bad
man in the court or with a lawyer see
let me tell you when a man is dead
everything about him is dead they are
just cooking all manner of stories
against this man I'm not saying that I'm
God I'm a God or God but let me tell you
why not go to court when he was allowed
alive Pro it that TV Joshua was a bad
man TV Joshua go to state interview his
kidsmen they the one that will tell you
whom T Joshua is when Joshua died they
went to his house TB Joshua's nephew or
Uncle he relived the story of the man
called TB Joshua he was a good man right
from school his school days TB Joshua
was a man that is generous he can give
he loves people he doesn't want people
to suffer I'm telling you the truth
so if he come up with any argument of T
josu to elephant or vulture or sleeping
with people's wives why didn't he take
him to court and prove it to the world
now that Joshua is dead now that the
giant is no longer there you are trying
to make you know
mess fall of his name because the man is
not alive let let me tell you if
actually that what they are saying is
right I think it's left for God to judge
him if actually what they saying is
wrong I think someone else somebody
somewhere else is going to Triple such
criticism or adance against TB Joshua on
them it's going toang to all of them I
don't think T TB Joshua is guilty of all
this
criticisms are listening to me all these
sins
offenses they are
or you know accusing him of I don't
think it is but it is only God that will
judge them if what they are saying
against this man Li is it BBC uh or the
people that confess
BBC is from UK England Britain they are
the worst people on the continent of
Africa now they are our enemies the
enemies of progress BBC are talking
about they are the English people and
Christians there's another name they
give them these people believes in
Witchcraft and they went against
witchcraft in 16 17 18 centuries onward
they kill anybody that is wish they kill
anybody that is Wizard that's how they
killed in America too listen and listen
good enemy of Christianity you are
talking about are the Britain so they
would like to rur England the Church of
England King Henry VII found
it
started Church of England during the
Reformation in 13 14 centuries it was a
controversy between him and the pope
when he wanted to marry Kine his senior
brother's wife see listen war broke out
between the Catholics and all the
followers of Pope that how arasmus John
Calvin Henry the broke out from the
Catholic Church who is Britain Britain
there not Christian Christians they are
anti-christian anti-s semantics they
hate the Jews they hate Jesus Christ so
whatever Britain is accusing to Joshua
of Britain they are more or less
pagans they sto most of the Antics actif
Antiquities from
Nigeria London what are you telling me
are they
believers they are not Dain que
Elizabeth
is a Christian what are you telling me
so it doesn't matter of whatever anybody
is accusing TB Joshua of I'm not trying
to exate him I'm a man I'm not God it's
God that is going to exate and judge but
I'm telling you that I dis associatees
or dist myself from any criticism or
blames or accusation
against TB Joshua of Synagogue Church of
all Nations that's my own take
