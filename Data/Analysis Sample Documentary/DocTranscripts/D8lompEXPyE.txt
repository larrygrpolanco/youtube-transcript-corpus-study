welcome to the credaceous period
the awkward adolescence of the world's
history when even the wildlife
was still figuring out what it wanted to
be what the heck is that
[Music]
and here the world's first families
ruined
hunting for a better life
living by one rule eat
or be eaten
the throttometer we'll see where the
crude oil lands on a scale of
[Music]
let's take a look
i give you
the death
cat this giant sabretooth tiger sports
the color palette of a parrot
and is fueled by an insatiable appetite
for friendship
this good-natured creature is always
ready to jump into action
to help his adopted family with any task
even when it's hard to swallow i'm glad
it's you chunky
time to say hello
to the chicken seal
[Music]
pot chicken part seal all screamer
although sluggishly docile in nature
their speed and temper multiply
especially if they're crudely awoken
from their sleep
i'm sorry i'm sorry
here comes the new age
the prehistoric sloth
is actually the fastest sloth recorded
to date moving at a notable speed of
normal a sloth's main method of
self-defense is their symbiotic
relationship with humans they cling onto
their seatbelt mode
and in return humans have something cute
to show off hold on stop you accessorize
with a sloth i accessorize with the
sloth
onto something with a little more bite
the landshark
this cold-blooded killer is a predator
of both sea
and land we aren't actually gonna cross
that are we frequently leaving the
world's first families with nowhere to
run or swim because either way you're
going to eat us you should eat the fat
one first they're dead
oh my goodness
here comes the new age
try not to pee your pants as you behold
the wolf spider
a terrifying hybrid of eyes and legs
their fur allows them to blend into the
arctic forest ready to ambush their prey
and protect their pack at all times you
don't want to stupidly stumble into
their den guys wait a minute come here
little guy oh maybe you do
it wouldn't be my problem
i'm gonna go pet him
race for impact as i give you
the punch monkey
a distant and i mean distant cousin of
the primates we know today and speaking
of cousins there are many types of
panchaki
like the kick monkey and the disturbing
creeper monkey
what are you doing each one a bigger
butthead than the last especially the
headbutt monkey that's rough punch
monkey is communicated by a complex
language based almost entirely on
interpersonal violence i'm fluent in
punch monkey
what's he saying they're always a hit
you slap your mother with that hand
here comes the credaceous period
a brief moment in time that became one
of the most important chapters in our
evolution are you seeing this wow
it was full of excitement and adventure
get your head in the game
it was full of the most stupendously
mind-boggling creatures that you just
have to ask what the heck was mother
nature thinking
how anyone made it out alive
is beyond me
[Music]
