and welcome back to the fluctus channel
from the earliest days of Commerce
companies and individuals alike needed a
way to transport goods from one place to
another
[Music]
ships were the best option back then
just as they are today
these large boats could carry thousands
of pounds of products move relatively
swiftly and travel to Ports worldwide
over time these smaller vessels evolved
into today's container ships
which can carry tens of thousands of
containers and loads of Advanced
Equipment
[Music]
in the 1700s and 1800s galleons and
other wooden sailing ships were the
primary methods of moving cargo from
place to place
all right
unfortunately the cargo was loaded and
unloaded by hand which was labor
intensive and time-consuming
different ships were also designed to
carry different cargo types making
loading and unloading inefficient
[Music]
also complicating matters were the poor
conditions aboard these older ships
rotted wood and bad storage practices
could quickly spoil shipments of food
and other organic materials before they
get to their destination
fortunately in the 1950s a trucking
entrepreneur named Malcolm McLean
devised an idea to standardized
containers
these new self-contained steel boxes
could be easily loaded onto a truck
train or ship while the ships could get
the most out of each Journey
[Music]
McLean's company Sealand service soon
launched the first container ship the SS
ideal X
the ideal X was 524 feet long and could
carry 58 33 foot containers at once
containerization quickly gained
popularity due to its efficiency and
cost effectiveness
by the 1970s most of the cargo was being
shipped in containers
[Music]
container ships became more extensive
and specialized and special container
Terminals and cranes were installed at
ports to better accommodate them
[Music]
among the largest ever constructed is
the oocl Hong Kong which is
1311 feet long
[Music]
and can carry 21
413 20-foot equivalent containers
[Music]
and the Evergreen everlot which is 1 312
feet long and has a teu capacity of 24
0004.
the latter ship is owned by Evergreen
Marine a Taiwanese shipping giant with
more than 150 cargo vessels in its Fleet
of these nine are in the same class as
the ever a lot Class A
despite their immense size the Evergreen
Class A vessels are typically crewed by
just 20 to 25 people consisting of a
captain officers engineers and other
workers
life on board an egg container ship can
be both challenging and rewarding
the crew Works long hours often spending
several months at Sea before returning
home
to make them comfortable the
shipbuilders installed a variety of
amenities
these include well-appointed Lounge
areas
Lively crew quarters
as well as gyms and Recreation rooms
where the crew can relax and unwind
during their off hours
another well-known company in the global
shipping industry is mayorsk based out
of Denmark
[Music]
E-class vessels have similar Dimensions
to the Evergreen class A's but have
slightly less carrying capacity
[Music]
the work schedule on these 1 300 foot
ships typically follows a rotating shift
pattern where crew members work in
shifts of four to six hours for a period
of several months
nearly all the onboard space is
dedicated to the storage containers
so most of the crew is located in the
tower which stores the bridge and crew
quarters
engine room is located at the stern of
the ship on the lower decks
those working on the deck are typically
charged with checking the lashings and
inspecting the cargo containers
regularly
oh
there is also a mess and Kitchen on
board where crew members can enjoy their
daily meals
and facilities for properly disposing of
food and other waste
constructing a vessel of this size and
weight is done in sections each of which
is fabricated indoors
the bulk of the assembly is accomplished
inside a dry dock using specialized
heavy lifting cranes
as each section is moved into place they
will be welded together to form a
complete hole
[Music]
though the deck of a container ship may
appear flat it is actually made up of
multiple cargo Chambers hundreds of feet
deep
these are where most of the cargo
containers are stored during transport
though several thousand will also sit
above the deckline
once the hole of the ship is complete
the tower and crew quarters will be
added
next the ship's equipment is installed
this includes the engines
propellers Rudder steering gear and
other mechanical and electrical systems
the final stage is the installation of
the crew quarters and other interior
furnishings
[Music]
from design to completion the average
large-scale container ship will cost
tens or hundreds of millions of dollars
[Music]
to ensure they operate as intended
companies like Maersk will put each new
vessel through a battery of tests known
as sea trials
during this process the ship is put
through a series of tests and drills to
ensure it is seaworthy and ready for
service
over several weeks the crew and
Engineers will examine the ship's
propulsion systems
steering systems navigation equipment
and safety features
the ship's engines will be tested at
various speeds and under different loads
to ensure they operate correctly
foreign
systems will be tested to ensure the
ship can maneuver safely in all
conditions
once the sea trials are complete and
necessary adjustments have been made the
ship will be officially delivered to the
buyer and can begin its service
[Music]
all around the world hundreds of
billions of dollars worth of Port
infrastructure have been installed to
allow container ships to do their jobs
[Music]
these include massive heavy lifting
cranes and Acres of Port facilities
where the offloaded containers can be
stored cataloged and taken to their
final destination usually by train or
truck
[Music]
one of the largest and deepest container
terminals in the world is Minami hanmoku
in Yokohama Japan
thank you
the terminal is situated on a man-made
Island in Tokyo bay and covers an area
of approximately 127 hectares
it has a total Quay length of 2500
meters and is equipped with 12 births
Each of which can accommodate even the
largest container ships
the terminal is exceptionally Advanced
and equipped with state-of-the-art
container handling Solutions
these include automated stacking cranes
automated guided vehicles
and a computerized management system
this allows for quick and efficient
loading and unloading of containers
helping to minimize turnaround times for
ships
automated or not the container loading
process is crucial to the success of any
shipment
this is accomplished using a variety of
Machinery particularly cranes
these move the containers into place
while workers on the ship lock them into
place
all containers have locking mechanisms
at the corners so the burst is attached
to the hole and each subsequent
container in the stack is attached to
the one underneath it
once each stack is complete it will be
further secured with lashing equipment
such as chains cables and turnbuckles
[Music]
the crew also checks the weight and
distribution of the containers
throughout the process to ensure that
the ship is properly balanced
upon arrival at the destination Port the
ship is positioned at the dock and the
cranes begin unloading the containers
[Music]
the crane operator uses twist locks to
release the container from the ship's
deck individually
[Music]
this requires a lot of care and
organization not to damage the rest of
the stack
[Music]
depending on the container's Final
Destination it may be put onto a truck
for immediate storage or loaded into a
freight semi for delivery
in many cases ports like these will be
constructed near Railway stations
allowing the cranes to place the
containers directly onto flatbed cars
for immediate shipment
[Music]
the fact that the largest ships can
carry more than twenty thousand
containers this process can take up to
three days
[Music]
