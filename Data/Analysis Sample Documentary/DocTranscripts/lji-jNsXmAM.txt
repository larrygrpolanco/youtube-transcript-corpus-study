Renaissance Technologies is the most profitable 
hedge fund in history. This is probably the single  
most successful hedge fund in the history of the 
industry in terms of its performance record. Right  
so you gotta remember he charges a lot but 
um before fee is 66 on average since 1988.  
Behind the firm's wild success are a series of 
mathematical models and powerful computers. The  
quantitative models at Renaissance Technologies 
are constantly being updated but what's more  
important than those models are the ways and 
methods that are used to discover trading signals
Jim Simons the founder of Renaissance Technologies 
is a legendary mathematician. He pioneered  
a unique way of research and model building to 
the world of hedge funds. He's worth 21 billion  
dollars making him the highest earning hedge fund 
manager in the world. Born and raised in Brookline  
Massachusetts Jim Simons always knew that he 
wanted to be a mathematician. We used to go to a  
a delicatessen late at night when I was a student 
and one day I saw Ambrose and Singer come in  
late at night and they were obviously doing 
mathematics and I saw this on a number of  
occasions and I thought boy that's that's the 
greatest job in the world! When you can just  
hang out and hang out at a delicatessen and do 
mathematics. Simons' enrolled in MIT and even  
skipped the first year of mathematics thanks to 
advanced placement courses he took in high school.  
Simons' academic career was very smooth and after 
earning his PHD he quickly became a professor of  
math and also took a job as a cold war code 
breaker. But he yearns for more, particularly  
more money! Growing up in a middle-class 
family Simons' always wanted to get rich.  
Unlike other people in the academics who don't 
really care about money Simons' on the other hand  
knew exactly how to make money - start businesses. 
While still at school he started a business with  
his south American classmates they decided to 
start a factory to produce vinyl floor tile  
and PVC piping. Well I met some I made 
friends at MIT with two Colombian boys  
and they at a certain point started a business and 
in fact it was my encouragement that they started  
that business and my father and I invested a 
small amount uh in that business which turned out  
eventually uh to be a big success. This is a story 
of James Simons that a lot of people don't hear  
about so he took some time off to run the business 
at first but as soon as the business takes off  
he immediately delegated responsibilities to 
other people and we saw that time and time again  
with the story of RenTech but Simons' had to focus 
on his academic career in 1976 at the age of 37  
Simons was awarded the American mathematical 
society's Oswald Viblen price in geometry  
this price is the highest you can get in 
mathematics it's the equivalence of Nobel prize  
conquering one summit Simons was looking for 
a new mountain to climb in 1974 the floor tile  
company Simons' had started with his friends 
sold a 50 stake delivering profits to Simons  
and other owners Simons and his classmates made 
a lot of money from this business he said let's  
invest in the money so Simons knew a student of 
his who was running a hedge fund by the name of  
Charlie Fratfeld superseding Simons' wildest 
expectations he 10 x their original investment  
making them six million dollars total this is 
a moment Simons realizes the best way to make  
money is with finance he was wondering can I do 
the same in 1978 Simons left academia to start  
his own investment firm with the money he saved 
and from his friends he started money metrics
for years after starting money metrics Simons' 
relied on intuition and fundamentals to trade it  
was a great time to be in finance the fund is 
doing so well he didn't really have to change  
his approach but in the back of his mind 
he was wondering can he use the mathematics  
to model asset prices but Simons was getting 
tired of the fundamental trading we did very well  
but it was a gut wrenching experience you know 
it's you know one day you walk in and you think  
you're a genius god all my positions are in my 
way look up and the next day you walk in and  
they're against you and you feel here you're a 
dope how could I have done what I did and so on  
there was no rhyme or reason it was just you 
know you put your finger in the air and you  
try to sense which way the the wind is blowing 
Simons' quickly started working on his first model  
with the help of his colleague Lenny Baum they 
built a simple mean reversion model buy currencies  
if they moved a certain level below their recent 
trend line and sell if they veer too far above it  
the idea of meat reversion is very simple suppose 
you're a farmer and the average price of corn is  
five dollars a bushel now some days it may 
be six dollars a bushel other days it may  
be three dollars a bushel but in the long run 
these prices will revert back to the mean value  
this is what's called mean reversion back in 
the 80s many commodities were priced like this  
now his model would not work today but back 
in the 80s this was a revolutionary idea  
they quickly expanded the strategy beyond currency 
trading by 1982 he changed the company's name to  
Renaissance Technologies but soon enough their 
simple mean reversion strategy started to fail  
simple mean reversion is not sufficient anymore 
as other competitors started to build their models  
to stay ahead of the game Simons' had to hire more 
talents this is what really separates gm Simons  
apart from other hedge fund managers when he sees 
a problem he knows exactly who will be able to  
solve it he immediately brought another renowned 
mathematician jim x to develop a new strategy  
when Jim Axe looked at those asset prices 
he noticed that it is a stochastic process  
which is also called a random process and he 
believed that using mathematical representation  
is the best way to model those stochastic process 
when people hear about the word random they think  
that it's not predictable but that's not the 
case in mathematics suppose you threw a dice  
and you know each site will come up with a 
probability and you can bet on those probabilities  
to model the stochastic process they started 
using machine learning machine learning is such  
a buzzword today but in the 1980s most of hedge 
fund managers don't even know what that means and  
they still use their gut to trade but here's the 
Renaissance Technologies ahead of everybody else  
already started to use machine learning the 
style of machine learning that Ren Tech used  
was the kernel method the kernel used a 
class of algorithms to do pattern analysis  
the main tool used in academic finance is linear 
regression to this day linear regression is used  
to build forecasting models but the problem is the 
movement of asset prices is non-linear so rather  
than use linear regression Ren Tech decided to 
build non-linear models to predict price movements  
Simons' at the time was proposing building 
an early machine learning system this model  
would generate predictions for various commodity 
prices based on complex patterns clusters and  
correlations that'd be very hard for the naked eye 
to see once again they were so ahead of their time  
this kernel was like a black box that suggested 
trades that people couldn't even understand when  
the team started testing the model they quickly 
see great returns the firm began incorporating  
hard dimensional kernel regression approaches 
higher dimensional kernels work best for trending  
models they're great at predicting how long a 
trend will last at this point Simons have put  
up millions to this automated trading system 
they call it the medallion fund the Simons saw  
more potential improvement he started investing 
heavily in bringing more mathematical talents with  
the gen x model renaissance technology started 
to combine trend following with main reversion
the model has generated about 20 annual returns 
which is a great performance considering most of  
the hedge funds made less than 12 percent the 
Simons' wanted better he brought out another  
brilliant mathematician Ellyn Berlekamp 
Ellyn Berlekamp’s specialty was game and  
information theory he immediately suggested 
to focus on shorter term traits to reduce risk  
by going in and out quickly Simons took his advice 
and started focusing on shorter term approach  
they do a very different approach it's 
all patterns it's all short term it's not  
high frequency but it's something very distinct 
from what everybody else is doing now Berlekamp  
became fully in charge of the medallion fund he 
started fully implementing his ideas he argued  
they should learn to handle trades like casinos 
a casino doesn't care about any particular bet  
even if you win like 10 times a casino is happy 
because it knows that in the long run the casino  
has the statistical advantage this is what's 
called the law of large numbers I think what  
Ren Tech adopted was the kelly criterion this 
is what we call the scientific gambling method  
to put it simply it's your bet should be 
proportional to how confidence you are in your bet  
the formula is your expected net winnings divided 
by your net winnings if you win I think this  
is actually the secret sauce for Renaissance 
Technologies they utilize massive compute power  
combined with the scientific approach 
and to discover trading patterns and  
validate them and trade based on them they 
keep collecting uh the patterns and anomalies  
and that's how they stay ahead of the game well 
any one anomaly might be a random thing however  
if you have enough data you can tell that it's not 
so you can see an anomaly that's persisted for a  
sufficiently long time so that the probability 
of it being uh random is is not high but these  
things fade after a while anomalies can get washed 
out so you have to keep on top of the business  
the firm implemented its new approach in late 1989 
where the 27 million dollars Simons have put up  
the results were almost immediate and startling 
they did more trading than ever cutting medallions  
average holding time to just a day and a half 
and from a week and a half scoring profits almost  
every day the medallion scored a gain of 55.9 
percent in 1990 the incredible streak has begun
Simons' personal wealth sword he's never 
hesitant to pay his employee a lot of money  
so Jim Simons has bought a yacht every year 
he would bring his employees on his yacht to  
all the luxurious places in 
the world you can imagine
Simons' wanted to have more money to make real 
changes to the world he needed to expand his  
hedge fund business even more the only way to 
do that was getting into the equity business  
so far the medallion fund has been very 
successful at trading commodities but it  
was capped at 10 billion dollars till this day so 
when a hedge fund gets big every trade it makes  
gets bigger so we have a big trade like 
that it takes a long time for it to  
execute in the marketplace suppose you're 
trying to buy 10 million shares of apple  
it's going to take a while for the market to 
fill that order and by the time the orders are  
filled you might not actually get the price 
you originally planned and warren buffet is  
having the same problem that's why he's saying 
that he's looking for elephants now because  
the amount of stocks that he can have are so 
few nowadays they created a similar model to  
trade equities but it fails to deliver great 
returns Simons again knew exactly what to do  
he hired two top scientists from IBM and 
started tasking them with creating equity models  
peter brown and Robert mercer were experts 
in natural language processing it took them  
more than two years to solve this problem 
while their equity models kept losing money  
they discovered the reason why the mean 
reversion models don't perform as well  
is due to the execution of the trade their equity 
models were great at picking out best correctly  
but they were too unrealistic with the execution 
of those trades such as market impact and slippage  
so if you treat any stocks you immediately 
realize that you do not get the market price  
all the time this is the problem with the academia 
so whatever paper you read they always assume that  
you can get the market price but the market 
is a group of buyers and sellers constantly  
negotiating prices and if you participate 
in that market you do not always get the uh  
the market price brown and mercer realized that 
their strategy needs to model this aspect as well  
and minimize their trading cost once they solve 
the problem Ren Tech has entered into a new age  
Jim Simons went on a capital raised roadshow and 
expected its asset under management to the next  
level by 2000 the firm was managing 6 billion 
with 140 employees and the rest is history  
by 2020 Simons' retired from Ren Tech that year he 
made over 1 billion dollars what really separates  
Jim Simons apart is his ability to hire talents 
and to create an environment that the smartest  
people in the world utilize the maximum potential 
and more importantly James Simons insisted on  
using the scientific method to discover patterns 
and anomalies instead of using the gut intuition  
it's an open atmosphere everybody 
knows what everybody else is doing  
and every every week there's a research 
meeting if you've had a good idea that you  
you think it's going to go somewhere you 
present it if it looks good it goes to a  
small meeting people vet it more carefully but 
there aren't little groups working in the dark  
oh this is my little system and I want you to 
use it so and that's the best way to do science  
I think since Simons' left the firm Ren Tech 
has still been beating the market consistently  
the fun is so successful almost to a mythical 
level but as we now see there is no mystery  
behind the firm's success is Jim Simons' ability 
to gather talents and also his will to succeed  
don't give up I mean now  
sometimes is discretion is the better part of 
valor and you can just say the hell with it but uh  
and go on to something else and that's a decision 
that we've all made at one time or another but uh  
persistence has a lot of value and something 
that's really worthwhile can take a lot of time to  
come to fruition and you ought to have patience uh 
if you believe in something to uh to stick with it
