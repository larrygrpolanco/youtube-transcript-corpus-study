ah
old show that was very much focused on
his branding of the the circular LED
shape that was the cover of his first
album so initially we thought well let's
develop on that Nick wanted to move on
to a bigger scale of things but maintain
that kind of uh idea so originally the
the challenge was how do we maintain the
circle but try to put Sub Focus in a
more prominent position rather than
being hidden behind the installation as
he was because what Sub Focus has been
trying to do is develop the show so that
it's more of a live
performance there are quite a few
challenges when performing music
electronically often it's people
interacting with computers or laptops
that doesn't look very interesting to
the crowd I wanted to make my show
completely electronic performance but
make it much more interesting
[Music]
visually so because again we wanted to
put emphasis on this live performance I
thought well one way of course is to
have him in the center and people seeing
that he's playing with stuff and not
just pressing play but the other way was
to make the whole show and installation
react to his live performances so people
get that connection even
more something that we developed for the
show that I'm pretty sure is unique to
USS is that the Lights of the
installation are reactive to the
instruments that I'm playing in real
time so for example the drums that I
play during the intro also create these
flashes of white light across the
[Music]
circles we're using this reactivity
across several of the different
instruments that I play during the show
as far as I know uh we're the only
people doing this kind of reactivity at
the moment and it effectively means that
I'm controlling the sound and the lights
at the same time with Nick music is very
varied he has a lot of different sort of
elements that he wants to try and do so
we have a lot of scope with the content
to be able to try different things so
there are some tracks that are very
graphical based and other tracks that
are more sort of cinematic and his music
gives us the opportunity to look into
lots of different ways of making all
this stuff happen we have a system where
all of the content
will be in
place but he has control over each one
of these little clusters they're midi
controlled and uh link to his Ableton
project so anywhere that he wants to go
in his Ableton project this computer
will follow him so like this is a module
that controls one of these led
batter and this will tell it where to be
in space and how it functions everything
that's in this show was custom
built so everything that we built had no
rules that we had to follow we had to
make them up as we went along so we've
been refining the process as we go and
uh every every show we find something
new that we can do to improve
it now generally LED screens come in
just typical uh squared panels where
also all the LEDs are put into a grid uh
to do them in circles uh you can't
really find Parise that way one of the
new things that we did that hadn't
really been done before was to put the
LEDs in uh perfect circles within the
panel so that you avoid the steps that
you would get when trying to make
circles out of you know squared arrays
of LEDs the whole lighting installation
wasn't the only thing that we had custom
made for the show we also had a bunch of
stuff on the audio side as well uh for
example the software that I use on the
iPads um but also these motion sensors
which I use to control sounds during the
show by moving my hands around in air
above
them
these are the type of things that I've
wanted to do with live electronic
performance for a long time so it's
amazing to finally make them a
[Music]
reality
[Music]
it's R it bullets out my
window see a shells are on the
ground it maybe fatal when the wind
blows but you and I are safe and
S
[Applause]
it's when it bur it out my
window see it shares around the
ground in maybe fade a little
love but you and I are safe
[Music]
and
[Music]
oh
[Music]
[Music]
so here's a bit of a breakdown about my
live
setup I've got the trackpad here here
the two iPads I use this one on the left
for sample chopping so I can take a a
piece of sound and chop it and rearrange
it into little
bits on this side um I've got a step
sequencer which is basically one bar
split up into lots of sections and I use
this for programming new drum beats
things like that here I've got one of
the motion sensors here I've got the
other
one and uh over here's the keyboard and
here is various controllers to control
more in-depth controls on the step
sequencer uh but yeah and this is is the
main brain of the operation this is the
APC which I use for navigating around
the projects and playing different
sections of my songs so I'll give you a
little demo
here just run a
[Music]
beat then I'm going to add some
[Applause]
snares add a high
hat or choose a different high
[Applause]
hat
[Music]
maybe Loop a section of
[Music]
vocal start bing up the beat a little
[Music]
bit
make a build
up and then start to bring in the rest
of the original
[Applause]
track
feel like feel like
feel that's pretty
cool
