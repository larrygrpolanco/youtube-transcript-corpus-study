7 a.m kirill petrov the man of the house the 
first thing that he does every morning is to  
heat the house with a wood burning stove to keep 
his family warm on the ice cold morning in yakutia
because of the severe climate 
he really needs a lot of wood  
to hit the house for nine months non-stop
just like a dessert drinking water in yakut 
village is precious there are no water treatment  
facilities because the pipes freeze during the 
long winter so ice is the main source of water  
kirill and the villagers harvested the ice 
from the river in the middle of november  
when the temperature was favorable to harvest eyes
meanwhile kirill's wife liubov is making delicious 
untraditional breakfast kercheh whipped cream with  
a strawberry germ which was harvested during the 
summer in yakutia during the harsh climate it's  
almost impossible to grow fruits and vegetables so 
most of the yogurt desserts consist of dairy food
it's 7 40 am and it's time for 
arian the youngest son to wake up
arian is nine years old and 
attends the local primary school  
the children in yakutia will go to school 
when it's warmer than minus 54 degrees  
but when the temperature drops below minus 
55 degrees it's too dangerous to go to school  
today is relatively warm in yakutia only minus 
40 degrees which means aryan must go to school
like most people around the world he wash his face  
and brush his teeth arian uses the ice 
cold water that his dad prepared earlier
breakfast fatty pancakes and whipped cream are 
high energy food that warms you up during cold  
winters aryan's older sisters are living and 
studying in university far away from the village  
his parents wish for him to study well 
so he can live his life as he wants
um
locals understand the importance 
of learning the right clothing  
to survive in such extreme winters it's an 
absolute must to wear several layers of clothing  
and wear insulated pumps because the 
knees are particularly prone to freezing
aryan's mom always makes sure that everyone 
wears enough clothes because without proper  
dressing the cold will reach deep inside 
your bones threatening your life she also  
makes sure that his face is fully covered 
otherwise the exposed part can get frostbite
the temperature outside is so cold so the moisture 
immediately forms little icicles on his eyelashes  
10 minutes in the fresh air can be enough 
to cause fatigue stinging pain in the face  
and long-lasting eggs in the fingers and toes but 
little harder yogurts knows how to find the cold
but after a few minutes the icy weather 
begins to assert itself forcefully  
aryan has been on his way for 10 minutes already 
and now the nine years old aryan is freezing
luckily the last few meters are 
left and arian is finally at school
aryan arrives in time and there are already 
many children who have also arrived by food  
arian is studying in the third grade 
of primary school the primary school  
last four years and in yakuza education 
last 11 years before going to university
there are about eight students in the class 
today and five hours of daily studying begins
today they have math literature 
art geography history and languages  
yakut people study three languages at school 
russian english and sakha sakha is the mother  
tongue which belonged to the turkey group and 
is totally different from the russian language  
for daily life studying and working 
knowing the russian language is essentially
after the first two lessons it's time for 
a second breakfast today menu is apple and  
x eating regularly is essential to increase 
energy in the cold winters for little yakuts
after breakfast the play indoors the 
temperature is too cold to play outside  
and after all it takes too long to dress up again
usually the classes end at 2 pm but today arian 
finished a little earlier now he's on his way  
back home with his friend and like kids all around 
the world they can't ignore the local snack shop  
everyone likes ice cream and aryan 
and his friends are no exception  
they love sweet and creamy frozen 
ice cream despite the extreme cold
aryan and his friends on their way home 
are playing little games and having fun  
parents are not worried about their 
children it's a close-knit community  
all the locals know each other and there 
are about 800 people in the whole village
almost all the houses are made 
of wood each resident burns  
more than 60 cubic meters on average every winter  
for the house to keep warm and to protect 
the house from the freezing air they make  
sure to fill every gap with oakum or snow but 
still the cold finds a way to come through
wild yogurt and horses are also neighbors 
in this icy land they have thick skin and  
heavy hair coat and are able to effectively 
forage in the snow for vegetation to eat  
the yakutian horses can cope with 
temperatures down to minus 70 degrees
thank you
aryan is back home and ready to help 
his father most men in the village are  
engaged in the cattle breeding hunting 
or crafts same as aryan's father i mean
is well known craftsman in yakutia 
kirill makes traditional yakut knives  
for many centuries knives have played an important 
role in the lives and the culture of yakut people  
yakut knives are well known around the 
world for their strengths and beauty
aryan's father is teaching him these traditional 
crafts that has been passed through the  
generations the plate is traditionally 
forged from the locally sourced iron ore  
the knife handle is made from birch 
wood which is extremely strong
my
another of aryan's daily 
duties is to chop the firewood  
aryan knows from early age that daily work 
is necessary to survive in such extreme cold
so
now it's time for lunch and arian 
is always here to help his mom  
they are preparing a christian carp 
fish which his stats caught in the river  
people love eating fish and meat 
in a frozen boiled or fried state
after the work is done aryan 
rushes to the toilets outside  
in yakutia there are no indoors toilets because 
the pipes freeze easily everything happens  
outside the stand very efficiently and no one 
spends more time than necessary out in the cold
this fish is aryan's favorite it's 
so tasty and the most delicious  
fat and nutritious part is the fish real eggs
uh
hmm
foreign
fishing and hunting are important sources of 
food in yakutia from early spring until the  
autumn cold the yakuts are eating fish aryan loves 
fishing with his father at the beginning of march  
it's the perfect time for kuiuur 
which is traditional ice fishing
using their rods and nuts they start fishing
arian loves spending time with his 
father in nature they are fishing  
hunting and working hard to survive in this 
extremely cold but beautiful land yakuta
after a few hours finally 
aryan has caught the fish
you don't need to worry about bonking the fish 
because in just a few seconds it's shock frozen
life in yakutia can be difficult unpleasant 
and dangerous but we have learned how to live  
in harmony is mother nature and we appreciate 
the nature treasures and gifts that surround  
us we can always find a beauty even in this 
extremely cold climate after all there is  
no such thing as the bad weather there is 
just weather and your attitude towards it
