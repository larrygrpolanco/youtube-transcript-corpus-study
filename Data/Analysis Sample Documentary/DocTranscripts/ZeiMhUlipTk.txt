(somber music)
- I was 24, I had a
good job, I'd moved out.
I was quite happy.
Um.
And then what? (laughs)
(upbeat music)
- It is a strange thing,
the memory.
You try to gain experiences in life
and your memories is how you recall them,
and to me, that's everything,
but obviously you can
survive without remembering,
because Clair does.

- I have a page a day.
I have to tick off when I've eaten.
I tick off when I've showered,
'cause I don't remember.
I somehow still learned piano,
so when I've practiced, I'll tick it off
'cause I don't remember if I've done that.
- Clair lives in a three
minute period, that's her life.
And it continues along
the next three minutes.
If you ever seen the
film "50 First Dates",
when I watched that,
well, it was quite emotional.
It's very much like Clair.
- To me, it's random.
Just goes.
(music ends)
- [Interviewer] What happened?
- I thankfully don't remember.
(eerie music)
- I get a phone call, he said
"You need to get here quick."
Well I've never driven to fast
for here Woolwich in my life.
(moving music)
Saw Clair and she's in an isolated room,
but she was conscious and
talking and sitting up in bed
and she kept looking at
this calendar on the wall
and saying "Is it January?"
And we said, "Yes."
She said, "Well, what
happened to Christmas?"
- I've been told,
I think my flatmate couldn't
wake me or something,
and I end up in hospital and told
I didn't know who my parents
were, when I was in hospital.
- That was the worst time of my life.
I just couldn't believe
she didn't know who I was.
- Well, and I don't understand
how I could forget them,
but I didn't really know
anything in hospital, apparently.
Took time.
- Do your count again,
your count down from 20.
And see how well you can remember.
- 20, 19
and 18
and 17
15
11
11
Oh yeah, 15, 11 she kept saying.
11,
5.
What was I on?
- Five.
- What I was saying.
I went 15, 11.
Wait, what am I saying.
- It was the only thing
I could think asking her,
I dunno, it's a test,
designed in Scotland.
After we've left hospital where
the occupational therapist said
that you actually need
your short-term memory
to get information into
your long-term memory,
because Clair's is so small.
She hasn't got enough to process anything,
even just lifting your arm and eating,
you need that memory for that.
So she can't get the information
into a long-term memory
because she hasn't gotten enough of it.
(uplifting music)
- So it's four years worth.
It's been about that long.
I write down what I've done,
because if I don't write that down,
I won't remember a bit
later on what I've done.
(pencil scribbling)
Then if I need to do something,
I've got column because I won't remember
if I need to do something,
so I'll write it in there.
I do remember thinking,
what this is just silly.
Why do I want a diary?
I think I used to be a
bit embarrassed by it,
but I don't want to be without
it now, it is my memory.
(music builds)
- There needs to be repetitive.
That's the only way she can learn.
Harry, our dog, she just called
it the dog for two months.
It took her that long to
remember the name, Harry.
- Yes, stopping med, I've got that in big
at the top to remind me.
After spending a long time
trying to remember them,
I then had to remember I didn't
need to take them. (laughs)
I think when it was my birthday,
probably took a few weeks
for me to remember I was 29.
I say I've stopped aging though. (laughs)
So I'm happy that, don't want to get old.
So I've stopped aging. (laughs)
I've got diary and I
have a white board out.
This tells me what I'm doing
so I can just think, oh.
- It took her a long
time to learn a routine.
But now it's in her brain that's it,
it's got into the hard drive,
and it doesn't flick off when
she goes to sleep. (laughs)
Why you taking two?
- [Clair] One's got
the photos and lengths.
- [Mark] Ah.
- Right, I'm ready.
I've forgot, what have I forgotten?
We'll find out.
(inspirational music)
When I meet new people, if
I'm gonna meet them again,
I'll definitely warn them,
I might not remember much.
When I began to help
out in the charity shop,
I asked them for a photo.
I've got a page in the diary,
photos and names underneath that I check.
- She's been working here
over three years now.
I had keep telling her over and
over again in the beginning,
but most of the time
she gets it right now.
Do you remember when you first came in,
you couldn't find where to
put your bag or your coat?
- I don't remember that.
- Yeah, it took about six months,
but you managed it.
(Clair laughs)
Do you remember what my name is now?
- [Clair] Sue?
- No, It begins with an R.
- [Clair] Rachel!
- Correct!
- [Clair] Why did I say Sue?
(Rachel laughs)
- Wicked
- I can recognize people,
but I can't do names.
(moving music)
- Always your father's dreams,
always thinking about taking
your daughter down the aisle
and up until 2014, that was
always what was gonna happen.
- I was seeing someone,
but I don't remember them,
but I think they were nice
and tried, but I don't.
- Well, I'd love to think
that Clair's gonna meet someone again,
but she wouldn't remember
if she did meet somebody.
It takes something very special
because it is hard work,
without a doubt.
- Someone I remember
would be nice. (laughs)
- You feel sometimes,
is it worth talking to her because
she's not gonna know that
you've said something,
but it's silly, 'cause
in that three minutes,
she's a normal person
understanding what you're saying.
Good thing is if I get a new joke,
I do try it out on or
every day, different ways.
And I find out which one's
the best way of saying it.
(Mark laughs)
I often wondered if we took her somewhere
and she went to the toilet,
if a completely separate
lot of people that she knows
was to sit somewhere in the room,
would you go and sit
there and not realize it.
- It's different.
- Yeah.
- Dunno.
- Might try it on you. (laughs)
- Do it.
Try it.
- You'll just go sit
down with them instead.
Would you go with them.
- Good parts about bad memory,
I have a bad day, I can forget.
Don't write it down, I've forgotten.
And it helps. (laughs)
- Clair's always happy,
that's something that I find very strange.
I've never, ever seen her
upset since the injury at all.
- I feel quite lucky now,
I can't really complain.
- She knows she's not right,
there's something wrong,
but she doesn't worry about it because,
it's three minutes later,
she's forgotten about worrying about it.
- I think I'm getting along a lot better
and finding it a bit easier
and understand it a bit
more, which definitely helps.
- It's a strange thing, the memory,
and when it goes, it goes.
