oh
[Music]
my Lord
to everyone hope you are having an
amazing day this is Jim young and
welcome back to my channel this time I'm
here at Mount Everest and this video is
about the rural life here in winter
village just near to Mount Everest and I
hope that you will enjoy this video
let's begin this beautiful Rural Life
here at Mount Everest
This Is Tashi 24 years old who lives
near Mount Everest and her husband works
in lhasa all summer earning the main
income of the family so at the moment
she lives with her parents
and her morning always starts earlier
than everyone else in the family
that she's one years old son and this is
how he start his day changing rubber's
diaper is the very first thing Tasha's
does when the baby wakes up
there are trashy's parents Doma and
tension and their day begins with a
prayer for the happiness to all sentient
beings
[Music]
hahaha
they have two houses one day built
themselves 10 years ago and the other
one the government built for them last
year wow is that Tibetan Kung Fu Tashi
seems to be very good at carrying
children actually the state stipulates
that every child must go to school but
does she only went till to high school
and had to give up due to family reason
but now she has opened a tent Homestay
at Everest Base Camp and her life has
gradually improved
Natasha's first job in the morning is
cleaning the stove
normally in Tibet we will pour the burnt
coward and Ash in the toilet because one
is in order to clean up the garbage and
the other is to remove the smell even
though we have a gas cylinders but in
rural Tibet we prefer to use yak and cow
dung as the main fuel because everything
tastes much much better than cooking on
gas cylinder
[Music]
thank you
while her son is in the care of her
mother does she use of this time to
clean up all the house
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
and finally she has time to wash her
face and do makeup and now she's weaving
colorful braids with Tibetan
characteristic which also means that she
is married
[Music]
and she usually spends about five
minutes doing makeup but this 5 minutes
is a favorite time of the day
[Music]
55 years old and today his neighbor
asked him to help with farming
[Music]
and as I noticed that in this Village
they always help each other in every
work like farming building houses
Etc I also think that they never need
help from Outsider and looks like they
can do most of the work in this Village
by themselves or helping each other
yeah looks like they keep the tradition
of farming with horses and Yaks even
nowadays but actually most other
villages in Tibet use tractor for
farming so this kind of traditional
farming way is really rare nowadays and
here in this village with altitude of
4800 meter they mainly grow barley
[Music]
oh
and finally Tashi start with the family
morning breakfast preparation and Tashi
says that she's still not good at
cooking but her specialty is to make
pancake which she make for her son every
single day so growing up she was never
really interested in cooking but learned
a lot by using recipes so that she can
make her family happy and interestingly
in Tibet recent studies shows that these
days 70 of Mother's work which 30 years
ago was less than 10 percent which means
women power in Tibet is growing so fast
now she can finally have her morning
butter tea wait wait don't bite your mom
that's Tasha's mother Doma 46 years old
she has four children Tashi as the
eldest child of the family and the other
three son are still in school and as a
mother Doma always wants Tashi to spend
more time with her grandson so once they
are together Doma is so so happy to help
her with housework and now Doma is
frying cheese which is very high in
nutritional value and if you dry the
cheese you can store it for much longer
time
[Music]
um
and in rural Tibet once you are married
most of the responsibilities and
housework at the home are undertaken by
the housewife like Tashi and usually the
husband goes out to work for family
income
and after their breakfast she starts
feeding animals and I think Tashi is
actually quite Rich because she have
eight cows two horses and 60 sheeps
oh
after feeding cows Tashi puts her son to
sleep so she can walk more and in
addition to baby food that she must also
make time to regularly breastfeed her
baby
[Music]
Tashi usually can get two kilos of milk
every day and to thanks to animals and
nature Dash's mom burns incense every
single day as a Tibetan tradition and
they usually don't drink Yak or cow milk
directly but they like to make it into
butter by separating the fat from the
milk and then it keeps for longer and
after milking the animals she takes them
to drink water
oh
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
and then Tessie collects all the cow
dance and she dried on the roof when you
are traveling in Tibet especially
tracking in Tibet you will find stacks
of white laptop near houses and many
Tibetan Villages many Travelers may be
curious about why Tibetan people pie so
much young tongues at the living place
in fact it is not strange at all because
yet dung is a traditionally biofuel in
Tibet for centuries Dash's baby creates
lots of dirty clothes so sometimes Tashi
do laundry twice a day
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
and after washing clothes tashi's mom
asked Dashi to cook the lunch
foreign
[Music]
potato for lunch
[Music]
looks like they also want to eat
potatoes
thank you
and do you know Tibetan food is mainly
composed of meat like beef Martin or yak
and very few vegetables are available
beef modern and Yak meats are high
calorie foods which helps to burden
living at high altitudes to resist the
cold but now with convenient
transportations all kinds of vegetables
can be bought as they like
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
that looks so skillful
[Music]
mmm that smells so organic and so
delicious
and now she had to cook it in pressure
cooker for another 8 minutes and in this
eight minutes she will go to water her
fields
and they normally planted barley in
April and harvesting it in August and
you know the main crops grown in Tibet
are Bali wheat buckwheat and cotton oh
it looks like the Lunch is ready
foreign
[Music]
The Lunch is ready it looks so so
delicious I wonder how it tastes like
[Music]
[Music]
and after their beautiful lunch Tashi
usually checks on her ships as they
spend most of their time browsing
Outdoors
[Music]
after hatching the ship for one hour she
goes home but on the way to home Tashi
and her son always go to the hot spring
to wash their feet and relax which is
her favorite time of the day
[Music]
[Music]
in Tasha's spare time she likes knitting
sweater and chatting with her mother
these are her Hobbies
[Music]
Tasha's father usually returns home
around 6 PM after working in the fields
order to pass on what the older
Generations Left Behind Tasha's father
would teach her tibetan-gita and
traditional Tibetan dance for half an
hour every day
[Music]
and Tasha's mom goes to pray to Mantra
Chapel while they practice dancing is
the happiest thing she does
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
and when she got home her husband was
suing and preparing new prayerflex for
their family because tomorrow is the
most important day in Tibetan Buddhism
called sagada Festival
[Music]
so Tashi wants to make baliso for dinner
tonight this soup is so simple and
nutritious
[Music]
too loud
I think it was not
and do you know the three basic and most
stable food of tea bats are butter tea
barley and Yak meat barley being the
most important crops in teapot is used
extensively in the form of flour
[Music]
so this is all about today's video and I
hope you enjoyed watching this video
this is welcome to Tibet we are the one
who can show you the original t-bat bye
bye
[Music]
