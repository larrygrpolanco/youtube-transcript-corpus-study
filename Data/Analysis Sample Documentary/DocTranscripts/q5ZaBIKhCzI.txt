DEBETTE, I HAVE BEEN DYING TO

>> AND I HAVE BEEN SLOWLY DYING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IN MEMORIAM OSCARS 2017, OH BOY!
>> OKAY.
LET ME START WITH THE QUESTION
FOR ALL OF YOU.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS STILL
HOLDING WOMEN BACK?
>> THERE ARE ALL OF THESE TINY
LITTLE THINGS.
LIKE YOU'VE GOT TO CHANGE YOUR
HAIR TO FIT YOUR TYPE.
>> YEAH.
>> AND YOU HAVE TO ACT A CERTAIN
WAY SO THAT YOU DON'T GET
LABELED AS DIFFICULT.
>> YEP.
YOU'VE GOT TO EAT ARSENIC TO
MAKE YOUR SKIN PALE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> WHAT?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW.
SAMUEL GOLDWYN HAD A RULE, ALL
HIS STARLETS HAD TO TAKE ARSENIC
TABLETS TO MAKE THEIR SKIN GLOW.
THEN THEY DISCOVERED THAT IT
MADE US, WHAT IS THE WORD,
PSYCHOTIC.
[ LAUGHTER ]
TO CALM US DOWN THEY'D SEND IN
THE MONKEY WITH A TRAY OF OPIUM,
YOU KNOW HOW IT GOES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> I CAN'T SAY I KNOW HOW THAT
GOES.
I MEAN, WE DID HAVE A MONKEY ON
"FRIENDS" AND HE WAS --
QUITE A HANDFUL.
>> YEAH, A HANDFUL OF OPIUM, NOW
THAT IS A FRIEND.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> OKAY!
NOW DO ALL OF YOU FIND THAT
EQUAL PAY IS STILL A BATTLE THAT
NEEDS FIGHTING?
>> OH, YEAH.
EVEN IN STANDUP PEOPLE DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT WHEN
YOU FIND OUT HOW MUCH MORE MEN
IS GETTING PAID, IT'S CRAZY.
>> OF COURSE WE'RE GETTING PAID
LESS THAN MEN.
THEY'RE MEN, THEY'RE DOING ALL
THE WORK.
WE'RE JUST LYING ON A TRAIN
TRACK WAITING TO GET RUN OVER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> OH MY GOD.
SO YOU LITERALLY WERE TREATED
LIKE AN OBJECT?
>> WELL, I MEAN, IT MADE SENSE.
BACK IN THOSE DAYS, ACTRESSES
WERE PART OF THE PROPS BUDGET.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHEN I WAS IN FILMING, I HAD TO
SIT ON A LITTLE TABLE NEXT TO A
PIECE OF MASKING TAPE THAT SAID
"WOMAN."
THEN ONE OF THE UNION GUYS WOULD
COME PICK ME UP AND BRING ME
OVER, SHOW ME TO ALFRED
HITCHCOCK AND SAY, SORRY, THIS
IS ALL THEY HAVE.
>> OH MY GOD.
>> LET'S PIVOT.
WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE FOR WOMEN
NOT JUST IN HOLLYWOOD BUT IN THE
WORLD AT LARGE?
>> I THINK WE'RE IN A UNIQUE
POSITION TO DRAW ATTENTION TO
WORTHY CAUSES.
WHETHER IT'S RAISING AWARENESS
OR MEETING WITH POLICYMAKERS.
>> YOU KNOW, THE STUDIO ONCE
SENT ME TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO
SING "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" FOR FDR.
HE ASKED ME TO TICKLE HIS
PICKLE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> WHAT?
WHAT DID YOU DO?
>> WELL, I TICKLED HIS PICKLE.
HE KEPT A FAKE PICKLE IN HIS
WHEELCHAIR AS A JOKE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEN I BLEW HIM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> THAT'S THE END OF THAT.
LET'S TALK ABOUT WOMEN BEHIND
THE CAMERA.
>> OH, WELL, I'VE BEEN IN THE
DIRECTOR'S CHAIR --
>> A WOMAN DIRECTOR, WOW!
HOW COULD THAT POSSIBLY WORK?
OH, I SEE, YOUR HUSBAND COMES TO
SET DRESSED UP LIKE A PLANT?
WHISPERS THE IDEAS.
GOT IT.
>> WHAT?
NO, I DIRECT THE MOVIE.
>> OKAY, JENNIFER PANTY-STON.
CUCKOO!
NO MORE ARSENIC FOR HER, PLEASE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> JUST OVERALL I THINK THE
WHOLE VIBE IS SO MUCH BETTER
WHEN THERE ARE WOMEN IN THE
ROOM.
WHETHER IT'S ON SET OR IN THE
AUDITION.
>> YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.
THEY USED TO MAKE ME DO A WHOLE
SCREEN TEST JUST FOR MY TOOT.
>> WHAT PART OF YOUR BODY IS
YOUR TOOT?
>> I'LL GIVE YOU TWO GUESSES AND
THEY'RE BOTH RIGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> OH MY GOD.
GOOD LORD.
YOU SEE, WOMEN'S BODIES ARE
CONSTANTLY UNDER THE MICROSCOPE.
>> THERE'S A WHOLE INDUSTRY
BUILT AROUND SHAMING ACTRESSES
FOR HOW THEY LOOK.
>> BACK WHEN I STARTED WE DIDN'T
HAVE FANCY STUFF LIKE BOTOX.
THEY'D MAKE AN INCISION ON YOUR
FOREHEAD, POUR IN PANCAKE
BATTER.
ON A HOT DAY WE'D START TO SMELL
LIKE BREAKFAST.
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT
"BREAKFAST HEAD AT TIFFANY'S."
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> IT'S CALLED "BREAKFAST AT
TIFFANY'S."
>> OKAY, WHATEVER YOU SAY,
LITTLE MISS I PICK MY OWN
BOYFRIENDS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> OKAY, THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE
HAVE.
>> OH, BOY.
I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
I GOT MY TICKLERS.
WHERE'S THOSE PICKLES?
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
