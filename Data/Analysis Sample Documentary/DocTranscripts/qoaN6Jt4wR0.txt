[Music]
uh
[Music]
so when they said uh and the new so
throughout training camp that was the
saying like my trainer eggman and the
new the new world champion and he just
stuck in my head and i thought i got
this
i probably had about five percent chance
winning that fight like i said nobody
believed i was going to win that fight
but i studied him for a long long time
growing up i watched this guy
sammy
big respect to him mr legend
and uh
i was very confident i shouldn't have
been confident because i had 15 fights
and then yeah i took it at both hands
[Applause]
nice little stepping elbow there from
jonathan hagerty as he meets him on the
body now trying to [ __ ] tie this pop
multi-top world champion
[Music]
you know what was i like when you when
you raised it in the air i'm real
i had my family and my granddad my
friends
i came out to singapore
with my granddad to be there he's my
number one fan
and to win in front of him which run in
front of everyone really
the best thing was the gold confetti at
the end when it just came down i just
thought i had a broken nose as well
broke my nose in the second round i
couldn't breathe
and uh my trainer was laughing at me in
the corner my dad was laughing at me in
the corner get on my right come on i
can't breathe out my nose
so i just gotta get on with it now and
um
the best night of my life
so after that fight i broke my like i
said i broke my nose my foot was my feet
were mangled my elbows i couldn't
straighten them
um
[Music]
i was i was feeling a lot of pain after
the fire but when i had the belt wrapped
around me i took the pain away i got
rushed into hospital on a hospital bed
and um
i was i was hurt a lot hurt and uh
my trainer said i had my belt on me and
then checked my trainer took it off i
said no no i need that belt yeah i feel
pain-free when i've got that around me
on that bed with the belt at your feet
was it worth it um 100
and you know what what made it the
better they wheeled in my opponent on
the other hospital bed and we both he
doesn't speak english obviously from
thailand sami we both looked at each
other and went
and and it was just it was a it was a
war
it was a great fight it was uh
i felt like training was lying to me
because i remember before a message one
championship like a few years ago saying
great show i've still got the dm on my
phone
great show i would love to be a part of
it one day didn't get back to me
unfortunately
but then they realized and then um so
when i won the world title now
i went back onto the onto our chat and
one championship and i looked at that
message saying i'd love to be a part of
it
and that's when it comes to real life i
knew what i wanted and i achieved it
so i went in the belt and then um i
called out the best in the world because
i think if you're going to be the best
you've got to fight the best
people must have thought i was mad when
i called out uh rob tang chipmunk
the most feared tire boxer in the world
everyone would tell you
i called him out big mistake
he tipped my belt
i want to be the best so i got to beat
the best and to lose the belt against
him the first time
it was a bit controversial i thought i
won
he won obviously and um
it was devastating i was heartbroken i
was heartbroken but i didn't let it get
to me too much
they offered me the rematch
i turned it down so i'm not ready yet
turn it down i trained for an extra two
three months got my head right again
i said yeah i'm ready now
and then i had the rematch
and he defeated me by tko in the second
round
my mind wasn't really there you know it
wasn't really there i don't know why i
can't explain but um
i was devastated
but now on my way back
just got my first win back from off that
loss against tacky nato
two more wins i'd say and i'll
i'll get that belt back
so i'm jonathan hagerty former one fly
away world champion
three times muay thai world champion
uk born and raised i grew up in areas
kind of rough around here and uh
all of my friends sort of went the wrong
path but i sort of kept on the straight
and narrow
thanks to my parents
opened up a gym
yeah my dad was an mma fighter
originally and that's what got me into
it
he knows where he wants me to be and he
to guide he guided me the right path
and um
yeah he's a
he's a role model to me
without him i don't think anything could
have could have happened
i was about seven
seven six
as soon as soon as really
[Music]
never had a job
growing up as a kid it's always been
fighting i was just in the gym from a
young age so that was it really i had no
choice but to
succeed in the fighting mode
so um as a junior i didn't have much
fights in thai boxing juniors normally
have loads of fights like literally a
hundred fighters juniors i had about
four and then i got pushed into taking
my shin guards off
get pushed straight into the swing of
things then and um
i started fighting men at a young age
and my dad wasn't very keen on it but my
trainer was sort of he knew i could do
it so he pushed me and then from then
onwards i started knocking him out so it
started getting real started getting to
the rankings it was men when i was like
17 18.
i remember one time i had to lie about
my age to fight a man
nobody believed in me and thought i'm
just a silly kid i think i still had
braces on
and
i got in there he was number one for 10
years and i stopped him in round two
and i think that's when everyone started
to believe like this guy's the real deal
that was it i just knew from then that's
what i wanted to do
you just gotta believe in yourself you
know and uh i grew up with everyone but
around me my team around me kept by
pushing into my ears you're the one like
you're gonna be the best
and uh from then onwards i just thought
i'm gonna go to the top
i was five i was 14 i had 14 fights
and then there was um
all the promotions will get me to fight
the best tires in the world
and in my head when he was offering me
these fights i was thinking no i don't
want to fight
i had 14 fights i'm still basically a
beginner
but i took them
and uh i took risks and i prospered
the night before you can't you can't
sleep at all you know i woke up the next
morning one of these fights against one
of the best tires in the world
i woke up that morning to fight i had no
speech i was so nervous i couldn't speak
i had no speech and then um
as soon as you get into the arena
you're in the back room and you can
smell the thai oil as soon as you smell
that you see other people warming up you
think yeah it's going on now there's no
going back
you want to run out you can't you just
gotta get on with
it so now you're stepping up to the
stage to walk out to the fight the crowd
of that thousand fifteen hundred people
and it's very nerve-wracking is it's uh
it's very nerve-wracking as soon as you
step over them ropes
and you touch gloves
you've got no feeling in your body you
hit they hit you you can't feel it you
hit them you can't feel it one thing
you can just about he'll hear anything
apart from the my coach christian knows
he got the biggest mouth in the room
and that's all i hear and it's just go
time from there killer instinct just
kicking
[Music]
when i think of fear i think of uh my
body shaking adrenaline and just block
it out
just block it out like i said getting in
that ring is
it's very fear it's a lot of fear
[Music]
getting past that
i need fear to fight i fight better with
fear i deal with it after the fight in
the fight if you feel in pain
you can't show that you're right
otherwise you're they'll capitalize on
that
you need to just
get on with it after the fact you can
crawl you want
[Music]
a lot of things that you could be doing
fun ways
but you need to have your priorities
straight
and be where you want to be
[Music]
more excited we call it the art of eight
limbs you've got your feet your knees
your elbows your punches everything
[Music]
because one elbow just slip through
it's a game changer every time you step
in that ring there's not a possibility
you could step back out
and um put your life on the line i'm
fighting the best in the world and
fighting people with 300 fights it's no
joke so you need to be fully prepared
[Laughter]
[Music]
i've had three losses
i've learned more than them on them
three losses and i have any of the wins
you know so i lost one
came back stronger i won i lost another
one got signed to one championship so
open up doors for me made me realize as
well like i am beatable and um i'm
coming up against the best in the world
now
yeah you know sometimes there's setbacks
minor setbacks major comebacks that's my
one of my sayings
so if anything's going wrong
it's hard to say don't worry about it
but things will get right fit into place
just uh just keep going strong
i'm hitting to hurt
um
i want to take you out every shot i will
take i want to take you out i want to
hurt you severely
it's as evil as it sounds but that's
that's the reality of it
but after the fight we can uh we can be
friends
when we're in that ring
it doesn't matter who it is
this is game time
i turned everything down i missed out
once we were partying like
uh sacrifices i stopped everything
to get to where i wanted to be and it
paid off
i know you do need to sacrifice
you can't do
partying or whatever
you need to be level headed on one goal
this is basically my life man this is
basically my life
[Music]
what like what does it mean to get that
belt back it means uh
it means the world mate to be fair but i
need to get that belt back before i move
on type of stuff one championship is the
pioneer of martial arts so it's it's the
belt everyone wants to have
uh he's the only uk
um thai boxer to get that title and have
that title you're not gonna rest easy
until it's done no no way i think two
more two more knockouts
and then uh
hopefully we'll be back on track again
the one championship belt
would you say that's an obsession
obsession obsessed
i think that's the belt that is
obviously the belt that everybody wants
and i've had and i've lost
so i want it more than anything now
again
i'm a i'm a fighter and um
that is the pinnacle of my tire so why
not be obsessed to get in that belt i
don't think there's nothing wrong with
it
i think once the whole company won
championship everybody wants to be on
that you know everybody's screaming i
want to be on one championship
and for at the such young age that i got
on it on that big stage
that motivated me the most you know
people look up to me young kids now i
train a group of young kids i've got a
few world champions
14 year olds
they look up to me i'm their role model
so that that pushes me on more you know
for them to see what i can do and uh
so they can achieve that as well
just keep going just keep aiming for you
know keep digging away you foul you go
get back do what you do best and if you
want it as much as you you say you want
it you'll get
you know i want this belt as much as i
want it and uh
i'll do everything i can to get that
belt back
if it means getting up at five in the
morning twelve k runs
you go up it's gotta be done
i don't believe in failure
it's lessons learned in it really
you foul it's a learning curve
it's another opportunity to get back and
win i just think tomorrow will be better
tomorrow will be better and i don't have
that one championship belt in no time
got a few few steps to climb
i'm on my way
i'm on my way there
and i'll get there
i'll sign an mma contract with one
2022
i would also do muay thai
and i'll be the white tower champion and
mma one championship world champion
within five years
before that really yeah
two years now i'm gonna be walking in
places and everyone's like just that
that's that guy that's jonathan
that's what i want to start working for
you know to be the best
next fight is um 20th of november in
ireland

ko round two
