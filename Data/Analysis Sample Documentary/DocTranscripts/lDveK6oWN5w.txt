when you collect bottles it always looks
like you're out begging or like you're
poorer than
poor it's hard work but Herbert couldn't
get by without the deposit bottles he
collects he scour hamburg's Reaper bar
entertainment strip at night Herbert
worked hard all his life but hasn't
enough to live on many German retirees
take low-paying part-time jobs or like
care but collect
bottles 25 cents I wouldn't have seen it
I
would
you get knife for them 2:30 a.m. on
hamburg's Reaper bar people are out till
the wee hours in The Nightlife
[Music]
district nothing in there her's looking
for deposit bottles he can get a few
cents back at the store what'll that one
get you8 cents
it's not much but still it adds up at
first it was hard to collect bottles
other people had
used but I'm all right with it
now I've pretty much got used to
it now it's no big
deal for other people it's just trash
right yeah that's right but 10 bottles
is 80 cents get a coffee for
that he's 65 years old and Herbert isn't
his real name he'd rather we didn't say
it collecting bottles is no fun for him
it means picking through garbage and
poking around corners he'd rather not
poke around but he can make a lot of
money when the weather's nice or after
festivals in 4 days over
€200
going out every
night you can do it for 4 days and
before you know it you've got quite a
bit and you have to transport them
somehow it's a bit easier with a
car
Herber can barely afford it but he can't
do without his old car he uses it to
store the bottles at night when the
super markets are
closed how much so
far not
spectacular it's
limited Herber has to watch every scent
but he doesn't fret over it anymore he
does get annoyed when millions are spent
on Prestige
buildings that's just not right and for
just the little glass with a few holes
in the
side oh well hamburg's got the
cash he means the El filon hamburg's new
and rather expensive concert hall now
one of the city's Prime landmarks and a
symbol of German
Prosperity yeah oh oh 220 your money for
this
month that's the rest for this month I
get my next payment on Friday and I'll
spread it out so I can make ends
meat nothing in the
bank
no maybe 65 cents
left not worth thinking
about but I'll get some more on
Friday and I can get by till
Friday he used to go out to sea on big
trips to America Asia and Australia he
trained as a welder at hamburg's Famous
Blom and F
Shipyard it was a good job and well paid
as a trainee you didn't get very much
but you were working and learning and
that was worth
something what did you imagine your old
age would be
like I didn't I wasn't even thinking
about old age at that time now Herbert
lives in a small flat in Hamburg Styles
hope quarter a social Hotpot poverty has
become a serious problem for Germany's
elderly about 1 million more senior
citizens are close to Poverty now than
10 years a go her has to wait
outside strict
rules a weekly trip to the food bank
helped Herbert get
by that's a vegan dish no
vegan then I've got a nice soup here no
no
thanks thank
you no no thanks I don't eat
vegan people in need can take as many
groceries as they require for just €2
it's mostly donated by
supermarkets more and more older people
are turning up
here often they're reluctant they've
learned not to sponge off the state we
hear that again and again as the reason
older people don't take advantage of the
food
bank your first visit
like I was quite
shy I was scared to be honest
why I felt like I was
begging but now I've got used to it it's
about
dignity yes you get used to it now I've
got used to
it could you give me one of those
what what is
that yeah that's yeah that's
fine Herber worked all his life he has a
cheap apartment at the edge of town but
still can't make ends meet on his
pension come here just
look he won't do anything W you come out
couch I know you're lying under the
couch you're sorry come on out here his
pension comes to around €900 a month
nearly half of it goes on
rent do you ever think you won't make
it
sometimes you can start to Despair and
think oh to hell with it all but then I
always tell myself no there are always
those who are worse off than I
am and there really are
Herbert is separated from his wife his
daughter can't help him out she's
struggling with poverty
herself what I'd like to do is travel to
Sydney
Australia I think the city is so
fascinating just that oddl looking opera
house
there it's been there for many many
decades
already that would be the city and the
country I'd like to see one more
time but I couldn't afford
that it's way beyond my financial means
in every
way but that's my
wish Herber was born in this building in
central
Hamburg you went in
here this was the
entrance his father died young but his
mother always had enough to get by even
in her later years Herbert sees the
current situation is
unfair what kind of pension can the
young people expect who are in their 20s
and finishing their studying today just
think about it hardly anything at
all Saturday morning just before 5:
Herbert is on the
streets I think it's gorgeous here by
the harbor I really like
it his pension is in his account but
Herbert has to keep collecting bottles
the cost of living in Hamburg his
beloved Hometown is
high without Hamburg I could hardly live
I was born here and then to move
elsewhere no not a
chance if it's cheaper
not even then I need this
city bottle collectors work alone they
rarely encounter one another and rarely
as peacefully as on this
occasion this one this one this one one
South African Sailors are still out from
the night
before isn't hambur beautiful it's very
beautiful very beautiful yeah yeah yeah
yeah I like hurg h work is very
beautiful we've been out for a night
it's really beautiful and uh like
uhg is Riv R yeah Riv yeah yeah we came
from
R but when two bottle collectors meet
they often prefer not to exchange
words does make you tired yeah yes
it does really wear you out the dragging
and
walking but there's another up there I
want to grab
it he's on his feet all night for just a
few
Euros I'd say I make seven or eight
Euros at
most and that's how I
live actually I get by fairly well I
can't complain though collecting bottles
is pretty hard work but we have to do it
I can't change
that
and
