 
Thirty minutes north of Auckland
lies an area known as Riverhead forest
 
Here, three females have traveled to a mating
ground known as a "night club"
These females have engaged in an act
found only in the humankind
Clubbing
They've caught the attention of three males, whom,
are ready to mate
The males approach
in the most seductive way they know how
 
and with that the mating ritual begins
it's truly a wonderous sight
 
 
their first objective is to search for an opening
However, this proves difficult as the females keep
a tight proximity
they retreat to a safe distance to re-asses
The situation
 
egged on by the others
the youngest of the three males makes the first move
 
young and hopeful he moves in to strike
 
however, youth and inexperience play against
the youngling
he attempts to connect with them from afar
relying on making eye contact
he gets nothing back
for his efforts
the youngling is frightened and out of his element
he retreats back to the other males
the second youngest preps to make his approach
 
 
he has selected a mate
 
according to the alphamale
if a male can make physical contact
with a female, intercourse is assured
 
he's gone for it
however, in not way has she reciprocated
the gesture causing the male much concern
 
He has to act
 
 
the male retreats, defeated
any hope the males now have lies
with the alphamale
and who could possible turn this stud down?
his confidence is palpable
the females not being aroused my this, is simply
unimaginable
they do however, tighten their circle, a clear test
one the males must overcome
 
 
 
 
 
disaster
Even the alphamale has been denied by the females
 
 
The males desperately attempt to cover up their defeat.
Embarrassed, ashamed, still ridiculously horny,
the males retreat to another club.
Because, you know ...
this one was shit anyways...
