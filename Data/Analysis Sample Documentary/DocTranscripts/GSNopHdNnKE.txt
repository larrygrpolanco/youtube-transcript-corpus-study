criminal cyber gang has stolen as much
as a billion dollars from
over 100 financial institutions over the
past two years
the gang which has been dubbed carbonac
carbonac
the authors of the report call it the
great bank robbery of the modern era
their ultimate goal was to steal as much
money as possible
and they largely accomplished that 2014
russia in the middle of the night
one of the kaspersky labs employees is
called by quote
the most stressed out guy he ever talked
to
unquote it was a bank employee of one of
the largest russian banks
and he was so paranoid that he didn't
even want to reveal what was going on
he feared that his phone might have been
bugged and his emails hacked
and insisted on a personal meeting as
soon as possible
it turned out that the bank's domain
controller
was sending sensitive data to unknown
servers in
china the domain controller is the most
important server of any business
and if you can access the domain
controller you have control
over everything else in that network
this means that whoever gets their hands
on this server
can do everything from looking at
insignificant customer data
to adding and removing funds from
accounts and
even sending millions of dollars through
the swift banking system so
if this server is doing things that
nobody knows about
the bank probably has a very big problem
astonished by the fact that someone
hacked into the domain controller of a
bank worth
billions of dollars the kaspersky
employees went to work
they analyzed every single network phone
and computer connected to the internal
banking network
at first they didn't find anything
suspicious
however some of the computers had the
screen sharing software vnc
installed on them and upon questioning
the bank about it
they found out that nobody ever
installed it
one of kaspersky's experts then thought
that someone must be spying on the bank
employees for some reason
to test his theory he opened a blank
word document on one of the computers
and wrote
hello he then waited and
waited and waited until the computer
suddenly began to type on its own
hello you won't catch us was the reply
the experts were now dead set on
catching the mysterious hackers
and went on to try and find out just how
on earth they managed to gain control
over something as important as the
domain controller
they discovered that a bank employee had
received an email from someone who was
claiming to be a legitimate customer
however
in reality this email was completely
fake
to make things even worse this email had
a malicious word document attached to it
the hackers had infected the file with
their malware
and once the bank's employee opened this
document
the malware activated itself and
installed a vnc
back door on the computer this is what
is known
as a phishing attack or to be more
specific
a spear phishing attack in these types
of attacks
hackers try to look as credible as
possible by creating emails that mimic
real people or businesses these emails
usually have an
infected file attached to them which can
be anything from a word
excel or powerpoint document and in some
cases even images or video files
once they successfully infected a
computer the hackers could now remotely
watch
and control the machine the attackers
then used this infected pc to infect
the rest of the machines connected to
the network and to search for the
administrator's computer
this is where the next phase of the
attack begins
they would slow down the admin computer
by running as many background programs
as possible
and hoping that one of the bank
employees would eventually contact
it support to fix the pc and this
is exactly what happened once the it
support arrived
they entered the admin passwords and
tried to fix the problems on the
computer
however unbeknownst to them they didn't
fix anything
instead they had just compromised the
security
of the entire bank thanks to a key
logger
a program that records every keystroke
made on the keyboard
the hackers obtained the admin passwords
and were now
able to log into the admin account and
infect the remaining network of the bank
the hackers now had access to absolutely
everything and this is where phase
3 started they would spy on the
employees for months until they knew how
they operated and what protocols they
followed
they were basically a shadow employee
silently watching and recording
everything the bank was doing once they
knew about all of the protocols the bank
employees
followed the robbery started
first of all they would impersonate
high-ranking banking employees and
manually send
massive amounts of money to their
accounts via the international banking
system known as
swift secondly they used the bank's
e-payment system to send money to their
accounts
which then again sent the money to other
accounts located mostly in china
and the us these accounts were then
emptied by the henchmen of the group
which are known as money mules
the next method was akin to the stuff of
hollywood movies
because the hackers had access to the
entire internal network of the bank
they were able to remotely control atms
and make them spit out cash whenever
they wanted
these atms were usually in remote places
and the money was once again
collected by money mules these methods
were pretty amazing
but it was the last procedure that was
the most interesting one
they would take accounts that had small
amounts of money in them
inflate them and then pocket the
difference
however this is where they messed up for
the first time
they accidentally inflated the account
of an elderly russian man who
only had 34 rubles in his account when
he went to bed
the next morning he had over 10 million
rubles in the same account
luckily for the hackers the bank thought
they had made a mistake and no
investigation was started
even though the experts knew exactly how
the hackers infected the bank
they were not able to find any traces
that would lead them to the stolen
9 million us dollars and the case was
eventually put on hold
a few weeks later eugene kaspersky the
ceo of kaspersky labs
traveled to a cyber security conference
in singapore
there he wanted to talk about his
experience with the carbonic hackers
and to his surprise it turned out that
this was not
an isolated case europol
the european union's law enforcement
agency
had also registered a few of these
attacks on european banks
the two then decided to team up with the
banks that had been hit by carbonic
different cyber security specialists and
a few experts from other intelligence
agencies
the group then formed the joint cyber
crime
action task force also known as jcat
and started to pour resources into
hunting the mysterious carbonic group
at first they didn't find any clues
about the hackers
until one of the kaspersky labs
employees found a tiny mistake
in the carbonic code this mistake
enabled the experts to send a request to
the carbonic command and control server
in basic terms if they sent a very
specific message to this server
they would receive a very specific
answer however
there was one problem they had to send
this request to the carbonic command and
control server and not any other server
but nobody knew the physical nor the
digital address of this carbonic server
this meant that the kaspersky team had
to literally
scan the entire internet and send this
request
to every single server connected to the
web
hoping that one of the servers would
eventually answer them with the message
they were looking for
after two days they got exactly what
they wanted
the carbonic command and control server
answered their request
and as a result of this the experts were
able to find it
the server was located in the country
with the best it infrastructure in
europe
and the second best connected country in
the world
the netherlands the dutch police quickly
managed to get their hands on the server
and invited the experts to investigate
it the analysis of this command and
control server then revealed the
terrifying true
scope of the carbonic attacks they
weren't just targeting banks in europe
and russia
but in almost every country in the world
from china bangladesh india and other
asian countries
to africa and even the usa tonight the
u.s
is under cyber attack as federal
officials warned that a likely
russian-based hack
has penetrated deep into u.s national
security infrastructure
the breach is widespread and there are
growing concerns tonight
about what may come next without anyone
noticing
the carbonic group had been infiltrating
hundreds of financial institutions and
stolen
over 700 million us
dollars after this incident the
investigation got a lot more serious
the jcat task force began to cooperate
with other intelligence agencies that
were also searching for the same
criminals
these included organizations such as the
fbi
cia romanian russian and moldovan
intelligence agencies
and many more as the experts got closer
to the carbonic group
they suddenly disappeared the hackers
went
silent for a few months only to return
and commit
the biggest mistake of their hacking
careers
taiwan 2016.
the cybercrime group was back to
business as usual
but two of the money mules were
inexperienced and would cause a massive
problem for the carbonic group
while they were retrieving money from
some hacked atms
an unsuspecting local taiwanese resident
approached the bank to also get some
money
as the resident approached the two money
mules got so nervous that they left as
quickly as possible
and forgot a stack of 60 000 nt
dollars in the atm surprised about the
strange behavior of the two men combined
with the fact that they left a decent
amount of money behind
the resident decided to alert the police
the taiwanese police then watched the
cctv footage of the atms
and immediately realized that something
was off
they acted incredibly quickly and before
the criminals knew it
the incident was all over the news the
first bank
reported that over 70 million nt dollars
was withdrawn illegally the withdrawals
were made
in both taipei and tai zhong across 34
atms and 20.
to make matters even worse the police
had over
500 officers going through all of the
cctv footage they could
and they eventually tracked down the
address of the two men
the competence and unbelievably quick
actions of the taiwanese police
then led to the identification of 22
suspects
most of them were russians and the rest
were from eastern
europe the carbonic group was now
in big trouble and even though 19 of the
22 suspects had already escaped taiwan
three were still there alone in a
country that was hunting them
and with millions of dollars in cash
one of the remaining suspects was a
latvian man known as andreas pergodovs
he was the alleged leader of the
operation and after he saw his face on
national tv
he quickly decided to cut his ties with
the money
he went to a mountainous area near
donghu park in taipei
hid two bags full of cash and proceeded
to travel to the yilan province
the other two remaining members of the
gang were still in taipei
and decided to store their part of the
stolen money in the luggage lockers at
the taipei train station
only a few hours later two men arrived
from eastern europe picked up the
luggage
and calmly went back to their hotel what
they didn't know is that hundreds of
police officers were watching them
through the taiwanese cctv
camera network once they arrived at the
hotel
and left their luggage in their room
they went to have brunch in the hotel's
restaurant
this is where the police finally took
action and arrested the two men
in a perfectly coordinated operation the
police also captured andreas paragudovs
on the same day
the taiwanese police had done what
nobody else could
and even though the arrested men were
only henchmen that didn't know much
about the carbonic group's leaders
the taiwanese authorities managed to
make the first arrest in the carbonic
case
this is where the manhunt for the
leaders of the group begins
spain 2018
spanish authorities were investigating a
criminal organization that was
laundering money
in spain with the help of interpol an
international law enforcement agency
the spanish police were able to find out
who was delivering the money that was
being laundered
and who their clients were through sheer
coincidence
they discovered that one of the clients
of the money laundering criminals was a
ukrainian computer specialist
known as dennis k after thoroughly
investigating this man
it was revealed that he had links to the
russian and moldovan mafia
and that he had coordinated several
cyber attacks for them
they had been cooperating since 2013
and while the mafia provided dennis k
with the money mules
he would pay a hefty 40 percent of all
of his profits to these eastern european
criminal organizations
dennis k and three other members of the
group were finally arrested in the port
city of alicante in 2018
and upon raiding their property police
found boxes full of jewelry
two bmws and 15 000
bitcoins which at the time were worth
about 150 million
us dollars the rest of the 1 billion us
dollars was never found
and even though dennis k was supposedly
the leader of the group
kaspersky labs believe that there are
many more people involved in this
either way the group is still active
today
and still stealing millions every year
operating under different names
such as fin 7 joker stash
cobalt spider and many more
