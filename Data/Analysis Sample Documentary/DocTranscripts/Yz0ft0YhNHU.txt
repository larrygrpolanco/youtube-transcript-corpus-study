And he's in the house.
- [Dispatcher] Okay, you
said that he told you
he killed his baby?
- [Woman] (crying) Oh my goodness.
- [Dispatcher] Okay, ma'am,
listen to me, what's your name?
- [Narrator] When an adopted
daughter decided to reconnect
with her biological
parents, she had no idea
that it would be the worst
decision of her life.
Although she may have been looking
for a rekindled relationship
with her family,
that relationship would
take a disturbing turn
for the worse.
What is up, EWU Crew?
Today we will be following the
destructive series of events
that turned a man into
a cold-blooded killer.
They say blood is thicker than water,
but when it comes to this
case, it will be proven
that father doesn't always know best.
Let's get into it.
As a young man in his early 20s,
Steven Pladl groomed an underage girl
from San Antonio he had
met over the internet.
He decided to make the trek
from his home in New York
all the way down to Texas
to meet the young girl.
The year was 1995, and the
girl was 15-year-old Alyssa.
The pair's parents didn't stand
in the way of their union,
even though Alyssa was
still a child at the time.
The two continued their relationship,
and Alyssa soon became pregnant
just two years after meeting Steven.
On a January day in 1998,
the young 17-year-old Alyssa
went into labor, and together with her
soon-to-be-husband Steven
welcomed a little girl
into the world.
Alyssa allegedly witnessed
Steven physically abusing
their infant daughter,
who they named Denise.
According to Alyssa, he
would pinch Denise so hard
that he would leave bruises
all over the defenseless baby's body.
If that wasn't enough,
she claimed that Steven
would even trap the baby in a cooler
and diabolically wait
until almost all the oxygen
had run out before releasing her.
But these were sadly only just
a few of the alleged abuses
his daughter would experience
at her father's hands.
Fed up, Alyssa stepped in and did one
of the hardest things a
mother could arguably do.
She decided to give her
baby up for adoption
so that her eight month old
could live and be happy.
Steven and Alyssa's
daughter Denise was adopted
by Anthony and Kelly
Fusco, who were described
as very kind and open-hearted people.
They renamed the baby Katie,
and she was sent to live
with them in their happy
home in Dover, New York.
There, Katie would grow up to
become an artistic young lady,
on her way to college.
All the while her birth parents,
Steven and Alyssa Pladl,
remained together and had another daughter
nearly 10 years after giving
up Katie for adoption.
Alyssa felt that they were
older now and more mature
and therefore more capable
of raising children.
They had a total of two
children, both daughters.
While the couple raised their two girls,
tension between the pair increased.
Alyssa said her ill-tempered
husband's behavior continued
throughout their marriage saying,
"He would destroy things in
the home when he was upset,
punching holes in the walls."
Making matters worse was the claim
that Steven could not hold a steady job
for nearly eight years,
leaving the burden of providing
for him and their two children
on Alyssa's shoulders.
Steven's unpredictability caused
great concern for his wife.
Alyssa would later describe
Steven's true character
by saying, "I was always on eggshells.
Whatever his mood was, everybody knew.
And that mood was often not happy.
A lot of yelling, a lot of
things smashed in the house,
in front of our kids."
Joy returned to Stephen and Alyssa
when they received a notification
on their social media accounts.
It was from their firstborn, Katie,
who was now 18 years old.
She had turned to the internet
to help her track down
her biological parents,
and was successful in locating them.
After trading messages,
Katie changed her plans
of studying art in college.
Instead, she moved down
to Henrico, Virginia
to live with her newly-found
biological parents
and younger sisters.
Katie's adoptive parents
were wary of the arrangement,
but decided that she was old enough
to make her own decisions.
Familial bonds were
formed, but Katie's arrival
would only push Steven and
Alyssa's marriage further apart.
Steven's behavior changed
whenever he was around his daughter Katie.
Alyssa even pointed out
that Steven attempted
to make himself look
younger by shaving his beard
and changing up his wardrobe.
Noticing the growing kinship
between Katie and Steven,
Alyssa felt the need to
disclose to Katie the abuse
she had suffered at
the hands of her father
when she was an infant.
But the news didn't faze Katie.
Instead, the father and
daughter grew even closer.
Things between Steven and
Katie took an awkward turn
when the 40 year old started sleeping
on the floor of Katie's bedroom.
Growing concerned by the
situation, Alyssa asked Steven
why he felt the need to sleep in her room.
He became confrontational
and stormed out of the house.
Steven's affection for his daughter
had transcended normalcy.
They had fallen in love.
In November of 2016, still on unaware
of her husband's and daughter's
intimate relationship,
Alyssa moved out and filed
for a divorce from Steven.
They split the custody of
their two younger daughters,
and Katie stayed in the home with Steven.
Now with nothing in their way,
Steven and Katie continued
their incestuous relationship.
It wouldn't be until the following May
when Alyssa would finally
realize the extent
of the affection between
her now ex-husband
and their oldest daughter.
It was a bombshell journal entry
that detailed the unnatural relationship.
The entry was written by Steven
and Alyssa's 11-year-old daughter.
The young girl wrote, "Katie is pregnant.
Dad says they feel like couples.
Did they get a little
too drunk that night?
My dad is a (muted)."
Adding, "He's Satan, he's (muted) Satan.
He'll go to hell, but he won't
be the one getting tortured.
He'll be the one torturing people."
In the journal, the young
girl drew pictures of
both her dad and sister,
portraying them as demons.
The entry concluded
with, "Wait one second.
If he's Satan and Katie is a human,
then the baby will be half demon."
Horrified about learning
of the twisted love affair
and the pregnancy, Alyssa later recounted,
"I lost it, I started screaming.
I felt like I was going to throw up."
She then said that she immediately called
and confronted her deranged ex about it.
He responded, "I thought
you knew, we're in love."
Alyssa replied, "How could you?
You're sick, she's a child."
Alyssa tried to save
her daughter once again
by calling the police to
report the now known incest.
Although police interviewed
the two younger daughters,
neither Steven nor Katie
were placed under arrest
and they continued living
together under the same roof.
On the warm summer day of July 20th,
Steven and Katie decided
to take their relationship
to the next level.
They traveled to Maryland to get married.
Father and daughter
marriages are not legal
in the State of Maryland,
so the couple lied
about being related on
their marriage application,
and as a result, were able
to legally tie the knot.
As if the wedding wasn't
already disturbing enough,
in attendance were Steven's mother, Grace,
alongside Katie's adoptive
parents, Anthony and Kelly Fusco.
They can be seen in many
disturbing photos smiling
and appearing to enjoy the wedding
alongside Steven and
a very pregnant Katie.
Apparently, Anthony and
Kelly Fusco only attended
because they felt that all they could do
at that point was support
their adopted daughter
in her decision once again.
A few short months later,
on September 1, 2017,
Katie gave birth to a baby
boy, whom they named Bennett.
However, the happiness
of their new marriage
and young son didn't last long.
Steven and Katie were arrested
four months later in January
and extradited back to Virginia.
Police administered DNA
tests on Steven, Katie,
and their son Bennett to
confirm their familial genetics.
The two were officially
charged with incest,
adultery, and contributing to delinquency.
In court, Steven Pladl's attorney tried
to justify the unlawful
marriage by explaining,
"This case is an 18-year-old
girl who shows up
at the doorstep of a 40-year-old man
who's going through difficult
times with his wife.
They have a bond because
they're biologically related,
but they never knew each other
before they had a sexual relationship.
He was head over heels in love with her,
so much so that that outweighed the issue
of them being biologically related."
Steven was able to post
bail and was released first.
The judge ordered him
not to leave the State
of Virginia and to not have
any contact with Katie.
However, the court did
not deny Steven access
to his son, Bennett, who
was placed in the care
of Steven's own mother, Grace.
To leave the boy with
Steven's mother, who was 72,
was described by Alyssa
as a "shocking failure."
She continued, "Steven
shouldn't ever have been allowed
back to North Carolina where
he had access to his house,
his weapons, the baby.
I can understand they like to put children
in the hands of relatives, but not Grace.
She wouldn't have been able
to stop him seeing the baby
even if she wanted to."
Katie was later released on bail
and was also ordered not to
have any contact with Steven.
She decided to move back in
with her adoptive parents in New York.
However, Katie broke the no
contact order and called Steven
and told him that she wanted
to end their relationship.
Heartbroken, Steven did
not take the news well.
All he had left in the world
was Katie and the baby.
Things then took a devastating turn.
On April 11, 2018, Steven
went to his mother's house
to pick up his infant son Bennett,
telling her that he was
going to take the baby
up to New York to see Katie.
His mother didn't try to stop him.
She couldn't have imagined that
handing over the little boy
would be a death sentence
for the helpless child.
Steven took the boy to
his home in Knightdale,
North Carolina, where he strangled him
and left his tiny, lifeless
body shuttered away in a closet.
This was only the beginning
of Steven's murderous rampage.
He left the house and
proceeded to drive 600 miles
through the night up to New York,
where he had planned to confront Katie.
In the early hours the following morning,
Steven arrived at the home
of Anthony and Kelly Fusco.
He sat and patiently stalked the family
from inside his blue minivan.
He was familiar with the
Fusco's family routine,
and he knew they would eventually leave
to visit Katie's adoptive
grandmother in Connecticut.
As expected, Katie and Anthony
emerged from their house
and pulled out of the driveway
in their Toyota pickup truck.
Steven followed closely
behind in his minivan.
Steven couldn't hold
back his rage any longer,
and when the Fusco's truck came to a stop,
he pulled up beside them
and began firing upon them.
With every shot fired,
he unloaded his fury
onto Katie and Anthony Fusco,
killing them both in cold blood.
An off-duty firefighter was
there to witness the massacre
and was the one to make the 911 call
to first report the double killings.
The firefighter described the
horrific scene to dispatchers.
- [Dispatcher] 911, what's the
location of your emergency?
- [Caller] Hello, this is a Connecticut.
It's on Route 7 and Route 55.
Someone just went by and
shot this guy in a truck.
- [Dispatcher] Somebody just
shot somebody in a truck?
On Route 55, sir?
- [Caller] Yes, the beginning
of Route 55 and Lewis Avenue.
Just happened.
I'm a fireman out in New York.
The car pulled up, went
around him, shot him.
A whole clip full into his head.
- [Dispatcher] Okay, sir,
are you still with him?
- [Caller] We're here at the road.
- [Dispatcher] Right at the intersection?
- [Caller] Yes, sir,
right at the intersection.
- [Dispatcher] Okay, sir.
- [Caller] He's deceased.
The truck's in the middle of the road.
- [Dispatcher] He's dead?
- [Caller] Yes, sir, his
brains are on the road.
- [Dispatch] And he was shot.
Did you see the person who shot him?
- [Caller] Yeah, we pulled
up, there's a whole, yes.
- [Dispatcher] Okay, which
way did the vehicle go?
- [Caller] Headed toward
New Milford, down Route 7.
- [Dispatcher] Down Route 7.
Can you describe the vehicle to me?
- [Caller] It's a blue minivan with,
I believe, a South Carolina plate.
- [Dispatcher] Blue minivan,
South Carolina plate?
- [Caller] Yes, sir.
A light blue minivan.
- [Dispatcher] Okay, sir,
just stay on the line with me.
- [Narrator] 911 dispatchers soon received
another phone call.
This time it was Steven's mother, Grace.
In the call Grace described
what Steven had just confessed
to her, telling dispatchers
about the dead baby boy
and how Steven had
killed Katie and her dad.
- [Grace] He killed his
wife, he killed her father.
And I can't even believe
this is happening.
- [Dispatcher] Okay.
- [Grace] He left the
baby dead when he left.
- [Narrator] Steven's mother
cried out to the dispatcher.
Five miles from the scene of Katie
and Anthony Fusco's slaying,
police found Steven's vehicle,
but Steven was in no
condition to be arrested.
He had shot himself, and his
motionless body sat slouched
in the driver's seat
of the running vehicle.
Steven's ex-wife Alyssa
eventually looked back
on the events and said,
"It's been a difficult
roller coaster of emotions,
because I'm so devastated
by the loss of Katie and
her adoptive dad and baby.
But it's such a relief
that I don't have to look
over my shoulder anymore
to see if Steve is there."
