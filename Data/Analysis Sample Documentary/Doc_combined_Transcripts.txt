[Music]
scenarios in my head played out over and
over again of me snapping someone's neck
punching them I was really convinced I
was a pretty bad person I had no
understanding of what was going on in my
mind every 10 seconds
I had an intrusive thought popping into
my head and it went on for months i
forgo ways just a thing didn't go away
[Music]
I'm Alison and I've had puro and OCD for
16 years a lot of the things that I
think about our violence so I'll think
about doubting things out hitting
someone and pushing her downstairs I'll
be sitting in the passenger side of my
mom's driving and I can see my hand on
the steering wheel and I can see myself
steering the car into oncoming traffic
and it's like it's almost already done I
have a funny kind of experience with
unwanted thoughts because at first when
I didn't know what intrusive thoughts
were I thought they were terrible I
thought they were absolutely terrible I
don't really want to push my mom down
the stairs like a part of me is so sure
that that's what needs to happen and
that I'm going to do it a lot of people
would be shocked to be the way that I
sometimes talk to my mum I was SATA I
really want to push you downstairs I
really want to hit you I really want to
snap your neck I just like oh that's
interesting
oh that's good oh that's okay cool nice
anyway
what's for dinner what are you cooking
to the death I know she's really tired
of it sometimes she'll play along
[Music]
these thoughts are or we call
inconsistent with their values and
therefore they are ridiculous and absurd
to the individual and therefore they do
not get any gratification from or
pleasure
they're extremely distressing to the
individual and they're spending their
life trying to get rid of them or
control them everyone has intrusive
thoughts
most people when waiting for a train
might have thought what happens if I
stepped out in front of it someone might
be cutting something up with their
kitchen knife and they might suddenly
realize it would actually be incredibly
easy to just stab someone with this a
person with pure Oh might dwell on that
thought more than average they might be
concerned that says something about them
you'll have a thought you'll go over it
and over it and over and over it it
could be absolutely anything and it is
just thinking but thinking constantly
and at that pace
it makes your exhausted pure oh is a
term used by sufferers to describe
symptoms of obsessive compulsive
disorder where people experience
intrusive thoughts images urges doubts
inside their mind which restrain me
distressing or common obsessional
thoughts and worries might be around sex
and violence or religious themes so for
example in our sexual obsessions it
might be the fear that you're a
pedophile when you're not old you're
gonna push people in front of the train
my name is Kirk Stasi I am a
self-employed illustrator Oh she'd be
like different themes to torture its
hosts with with the religious stuff you
get a lot of guilt don't say this don't
go there don't do that if I thought of a
joke and laughed ah
that's rude you can't say that you have
to say sorry to God otherwise he will
punish you so I was a religious person
even though I wasn't religious I think
the images were just a flicker of a
force it was like a person in a white
gown it was another one was the crucifix
there was enough of one image of the
Pope or Christ a flash bang it's there
and it's like it's like nice Gaussian it
comes out you've got this overwhelming
anxiety and also
so guilt you feel guilty for having
these faults that you cannot control I
felt that that was the torture I deserve
for having a fault in the first place so
you're trapped in this cycle the point
being it's not your fault and there are
lots of things that then shape you
during childhood and adolescence but
there is really always various triggers
or things that are associated with the
onset not always but quite often my name
is Nathan I'm 24 and I'm from Hartford
shear I think what happened when I was
about 11 my nan died I became so worried
that I would lose my mum I had these
obsessive thoughts about her dying and I
remember I just constantly asked her if
she was okay if she got really irritated
because I was just asking her too much
but you didn't even if nobody wants to
be asked the same question again and
again and again the thought of my mom
died and terrified me so I had no
understanding of what was going on in my
mind
I eventually began to realize that there
was something a bit weird about the way
I was thinking obviously at the time
that I'd never knew what he was I didn't
associate that with OCD that's only
something I've recently realized it was
there at my young age been there a lot
longer than I thought it was my history
goes back 25 years the trigger for me
secondary school my myself and a few
friends who quit and local newsagent get
some snacks and I saw one of my friends
as he walked in grab some pick-and-mix
and shoved it in his pocket and I
thought that's how easy it is well out
of a crack and I could show off to my
friends as I came out hey guys look look
what I've got the store detective was
walking in the shop and she heard it did
you steal those I was mussed in the shop
and I think said well this is really bad
the police gonna go to your house have a
word with your parents they may have to
go to your school and just raid on me
with all these threats and I fought
there my mates of polyed used to spread
it like wildfire as a result I became
kind of school phobic more they tried to
push you against that fear the more
effective really really a sad time that
one incident could create such a
traumatic
affect the area I live in super quiet
nothing happens but I just feel like
someone's gonna jump out everyone is a
danger everyone is violent everyone
could kill me I might hurt somebody else
if they attack me it's kind of my big
thing at the moment is that every second
I'm calculating what's a weapon but I
can use to protect myself with I last
left house Christmas Eve
so from Christmas Eve until 12th of
January but it's not felt strange it's
just felt safe I really ate at the
beginning of the year so I think well
it's another year that I've not changed
or I've not progressed other people are
doing it so why am I still here
struggling yeah the first time seeing my
GP I said you know I the thoughts get
implied and then for some reason I
convinced myself I it was developing
schizophrenia which my uncle has
schizophrenia so I kind of genuine
worried if you if you will like that
didn't pluck yourself out of nowhere
like I had a reason there was kind of
some substance I guess to to that
obsession I literally would just stay in
the bed for the whole with the laptop
for two weeks there's no use trying my
parents would try and get me up and
things I just kind of have to be left
alone like I there's no I'm not gonna
I'm not gonna be able to function you
just kind of have to leave me but they
were just worried they but kind of
realized there was something something
wrong what healthy people without OCD
experience are exactly the same content
as the intrusive thoughts that occur in
OT the content is the same but the
problem in pure he is the meaning that
you're attached to them perhaps thinking
these things beans that I might act upon
them or that I'm immoral for having
these thoughts or the way that you
respond to them control them avoid them
or suppress them all these things feed
the obsession 2003 had a really bad ear
infection it just felt like someone was
sticking a red-hot needle in there I was
diagnosed with a close chesty oma which
is like a tumor inside it destroys the
inside of the ear
left untreated it can invade the brain
and cause meningitis that kind of stuff
and they arranged an operation but we
have to be careful not to hit the facial
nerve otherwise aside your Facebook drop
I thought well I'll put the operation on
hold because I didn't like the idea of
going into hospital and I've been
knocked out and that became a city let
fear and it grew you're dead you're a
dead man the HSE a Murnau has spread to
the other ear it's taken my hearing down
I've got white noise in both ears when
it gets near the point of you know your
operations next week I knew it would be
the death of me because I would not be
able to surpass it or overcome it cause
maybe therapy includes exposure and
ritual prevention in other words it's
about trying to test out your fears
developing a different relationship your
thoughts that these are just your own in
a world and you cannot control them you
allow the thoughts to be there but you
can't you don't necessarily have the
exact same reaction so you end up
pulling it apart and figuring out a way
of discerning water authentic concerns
versus what's them by OCD combined with
the medication that's how I you get
through the day gets through life my
first encounter with CBT was on the NHS
it was in a basement of a four-story
building I used to look up the building
regulations of any building that I went
into I would check out their fire stuff
like when the last on there to fire a
check was like when last time that the
gas person was there it was in the
basement this room was tiny it had no
windows I couldn't help but feel like
there wasn't enough air in there for the
both of us he had a shirt that didn't
fit that bothered me
his hair was a knock home but that
bothered me he was like really red-faced
there are far too many things to me to
think about to actually credit that
person that was front of me I had no
respect for him whatsoever there's a
possibility that I wasn't really ready
to listen to anything that I felt was
wrong that how I was living wasn't great
for me and so I feel like I deflect
adalah my anger and the way that I was
really feeling about my situation on
that person erp which stands for
exposure response prevention it's about
exposing yourself to that which you fear
so so you're completely avoiding knives
you didn't even want to see one he might
go towards starting to use the knife for
its intended purpose perhaps using the
knife around other people by exposing
themselves to their very uncomfortable
anxiety you don't stay in that state of
high anxiety forever it will eventually
stop to go down so the last time I had
gone to any by myself that was when I
was convinced I was both a psychopath
and I think a narcissism and it's just
the process of having to going up to
that desk and then tell the person
what's going on with you and then you go
and see somebody and there's nothing
they can do they are any concern is to
work out with her and what you're either
a danger to yourself or to the public
and if you're not and they then then
they send you off on your own as well
which is a really quite horrible
experience I kind of feel like they
should have specific sections in in in a
any departments for mental health issues
which I'm sure they probably do at some
hospitals but never one that I've been
to many people that can be cured for
some people that can only be merged and
for some people it's a struggle when I
had pure Oh mine was incredibly severe I
couldn't do anything else and it was
incredibly scary it still does
occasionally pop up but it doesn't make
me afraid in fact it really has no
effect whatsoever so it will pop up and
then maybe I won't have it anymore for
the next couple of days there's always
been this big debate whether you cure or
you manage it depends what you consider
to be cured
I'm a complete night yeah I don't know
if I'm hopeful I just get the get on
with life how will these up things I
want to get done with my life I think
hope is a waste kind of wasted energy
you know I just think things as they
can't it's not gonna go anywhere I think
I think is too embedded in my
personality no I started to but my brain
whatever but I think it's gonna go away
when I look back at the old me I feel
sorry for that person who was in the
bubble you have to convince part of your
brain that you can beat this thing it's
about exposure I have to expose myself
to the spikes in anxiety expose myself
to the intrusive thoughts and live
anyway live through them not around them
which I'm really good at doing you can
create a structure where you could
survive it I'm happy that I'm actually
creating artwork and selling it and I am
taking commissions I'm happy now if you
want to change something you have to
actually actively make changes to be too
afraid to make the changes it's just
accepting that where you are now is
perfectly fine for you which is not so I
have to do stuff like walk around the
block understanding that someone isn't
going to jump out from the bushes and
try and attack me if you do something
enough and you sort like retrain your
brain then you should really like
rewrite like your neural pathways
basically I should be able to rewrite
the story in my head

7 a.m kirill petrov the man of the house the 
first thing that he does every morning is to  
heat the house with a wood burning stove to keep 
his family warm on the ice cold morning in yakutia
because of the severe climate 
he really needs a lot of wood  
to hit the house for nine months non-stop
just like a dessert drinking water in yakut 
village is precious there are no water treatment  
facilities because the pipes freeze during the 
long winter so ice is the main source of water  
kirill and the villagers harvested the ice 
from the river in the middle of november  
when the temperature was favorable to harvest eyes
meanwhile kirill's wife liubov is making delicious 
untraditional breakfast kercheh whipped cream with  
a strawberry germ which was harvested during the 
summer in yakutia during the harsh climate it's  
almost impossible to grow fruits and vegetables so 
most of the yogurt desserts consist of dairy food
it's 7 40 am and it's time for 
arian the youngest son to wake up
arian is nine years old and 
attends the local primary school  
the children in yakutia will go to school 
when it's warmer than minus 54 degrees  
but when the temperature drops below minus 
55 degrees it's too dangerous to go to school  
today is relatively warm in yakutia only minus 
40 degrees which means aryan must go to school
like most people around the world he wash his face  
and brush his teeth arian uses the ice 
cold water that his dad prepared earlier
breakfast fatty pancakes and whipped cream are 
high energy food that warms you up during cold  
winters aryan's older sisters are living and 
studying in university far away from the village  
his parents wish for him to study well 
so he can live his life as he wants
um
locals understand the importance 
of learning the right clothing  
to survive in such extreme winters it's an 
absolute must to wear several layers of clothing  
and wear insulated pumps because the 
knees are particularly prone to freezing
aryan's mom always makes sure that everyone 
wears enough clothes because without proper  
dressing the cold will reach deep inside 
your bones threatening your life she also  
makes sure that his face is fully covered 
otherwise the exposed part can get frostbite
the temperature outside is so cold so the moisture 
immediately forms little icicles on his eyelashes  
10 minutes in the fresh air can be enough 
to cause fatigue stinging pain in the face  
and long-lasting eggs in the fingers and toes but 
little harder yogurts knows how to find the cold
but after a few minutes the icy weather 
begins to assert itself forcefully  
aryan has been on his way for 10 minutes already 
and now the nine years old aryan is freezing
luckily the last few meters are 
left and arian is finally at school
aryan arrives in time and there are already 
many children who have also arrived by food  
arian is studying in the third grade 
of primary school the primary school  
last four years and in yakuza education 
last 11 years before going to university
there are about eight students in the class 
today and five hours of daily studying begins
today they have math literature 
art geography history and languages  
yakut people study three languages at school 
russian english and sakha sakha is the mother  
tongue which belonged to the turkey group and 
is totally different from the russian language  
for daily life studying and working 
knowing the russian language is essentially
after the first two lessons it's time for 
a second breakfast today menu is apple and  
x eating regularly is essential to increase 
energy in the cold winters for little yakuts
after breakfast the play indoors the 
temperature is too cold to play outside  
and after all it takes too long to dress up again
usually the classes end at 2 pm but today arian 
finished a little earlier now he's on his way  
back home with his friend and like kids all around 
the world they can't ignore the local snack shop  
everyone likes ice cream and aryan 
and his friends are no exception  
they love sweet and creamy frozen 
ice cream despite the extreme cold
aryan and his friends on their way home 
are playing little games and having fun  
parents are not worried about their 
children it's a close-knit community  
all the locals know each other and there 
are about 800 people in the whole village
almost all the houses are made 
of wood each resident burns  
more than 60 cubic meters on average every winter  
for the house to keep warm and to protect 
the house from the freezing air they make  
sure to fill every gap with oakum or snow but 
still the cold finds a way to come through
wild yogurt and horses are also neighbors 
in this icy land they have thick skin and  
heavy hair coat and are able to effectively 
forage in the snow for vegetation to eat  
the yakutian horses can cope with 
temperatures down to minus 70 degrees
thank you
aryan is back home and ready to help 
his father most men in the village are  
engaged in the cattle breeding hunting 
or crafts same as aryan's father i mean
is well known craftsman in yakutia 
kirill makes traditional yakut knives  
for many centuries knives have played an important 
role in the lives and the culture of yakut people  
yakut knives are well known around the 
world for their strengths and beauty
aryan's father is teaching him these traditional 
crafts that has been passed through the  
generations the plate is traditionally 
forged from the locally sourced iron ore  
the knife handle is made from birch 
wood which is extremely strong
my
another of aryan's daily 
duties is to chop the firewood  
aryan knows from early age that daily work 
is necessary to survive in such extreme cold
so
now it's time for lunch and arian 
is always here to help his mom  
they are preparing a christian carp 
fish which his stats caught in the river  
people love eating fish and meat 
in a frozen boiled or fried state
after the work is done aryan 
rushes to the toilets outside  
in yakutia there are no indoors toilets because 
the pipes freeze easily everything happens  
outside the stand very efficiently and no one 
spends more time than necessary out in the cold
this fish is aryan's favorite it's 
so tasty and the most delicious  
fat and nutritious part is the fish real eggs
uh
hmm
foreign
fishing and hunting are important sources of 
food in yakutia from early spring until the  
autumn cold the yakuts are eating fish aryan loves 
fishing with his father at the beginning of march  
it's the perfect time for kuiuur 
which is traditional ice fishing
using their rods and nuts they start fishing
arian loves spending time with his 
father in nature they are fishing  
hunting and working hard to survive in this 
extremely cold but beautiful land yakuta
after a few hours finally 
aryan has caught the fish
you don't need to worry about bonking the fish 
because in just a few seconds it's shock frozen
life in yakutia can be difficult unpleasant 
and dangerous but we have learned how to live  
in harmony is mother nature and we appreciate 
the nature treasures and gifts that surround  
us we can always find a beauty even in this 
extremely cold climate after all there is  
no such thing as the bad weather there is 
just weather and your attitude towards it

we've all watched those war movies where
we see soldiers create bonds with their
comrades by planning and achieving
objectives using heroic moves and
courageous sacrifices the team worked
they exhibit to achieve those
spectacular objectives leaves us in all
and wishing we could be those guys in
real life many of us want to experience
the same thrills and adventures without
the dangers of being hurt we found a
group of people that achieve and capture
this we aim to find out how we traveled
to an airsoft field in Vacaville where
we saw milsim in action no slow
operations are definitely a step above
regular airsoft games it's more
high-stress a lot of teamwork a lot of
things you see in the movies actually do
happen there have been events that you
go to where they have pyrotechnics going
off and it's just a whole different
environment compared to a regular
airsoft game building pull the clock
building pull the clock
when you're out there a lot of the guys
who do milsim have some kind of military
experience or even law enforcement
experience and they give you kind of
your insight they're usually the guys
who are in charge of the squad's and the
platoons that are out there doing a
milsim operation they teach you stuff
like really how to communicate with each
other how to stay focused stay on target
and just follow orders and how to really
stay in the game as long as you can
some people want to get a taste of what
it feels like I have a military
background I you know I've been deployed
twice there's nothing like it because
there's just not that level of danger
but people you know people really just
are drawn to like first-person shooter
games and some of them just want to take
it to the next level in a controlled
environment it became noticeable to us
that teamwork was a big part of the
milsim experience why is teamwork
important really if you do not have any
trust in your teammates and teamwork
will never be a factor of your squad
that you're in if you don't have any
teamwork going on you're going to fall
behind you're not going to get the
objective done you're going to get
pinned down all the time by the opposing
force and you're really just not going
to have a good time
roughly 12 down here there's guys but
there's a far way to do much yeah like
90% teamwork and Trust is the biggest
part of the game if you got some guy
who's around there being a lone wolf
he's going to go down it's really a big
part of teamwork I think the one thing
people should really invest in aside
from safety gear and you know an
operational gun is walkie-talkies a form
of communication teamwork address is
probably the best thing you can have for
Milson operations probably what wins it
if you're out there for the competitive
nature there's one person that needs to
leave one person that can make split
decisions if something comes up he makes
the right decision right away and he
doesn't take any hesitation first I talk
to people who have done milsim events
before so then you kind of get a feel of
what's going to go on understand that
there is a chain of command and also
when you're looking into what you'll
need make sure that you're not bringing
anything you won't need what are some of
the benefits of milsim most people who
take this serious sometimes feel that
you know like one person will look look
at them and think they're taking it too
serious but they take it serious because
they treat it as if it is a dangerous
situation and you know if a dangerous
situation should ever arise that's the
person I'd want backing me up well I
probably tell them like hey it's gonna
hurt a lot you're gonna be working your
muscles you be sore it's a good workout
like you have you have fun while you're
doing it and you're good workout you're
humping around like 20 pounds of gear
plus you're done great exercise it's
really just you know you're running
you're climbing you're getting dirty and
you know just the excitement alone it
has your adrenaline running which you
know it's just all-around healthy after
a full day of running around in the
field experiencing some of the
action-filled thrilling moments we found
out that military simulation definitely
delivered on its promise of giving us
some perspective of the military based
action the people we got to know and
Milson go all out
the air anyway yeah

tenerife airport disaster
a holiday from hell
the canary islands an all-year refuge
for all those yearning for the sun
for a long time the archipelago in the
atlantic ocean has been attracting
tourists from all over the world
it is the place to be now as it was back
in the 70s
however back then the islands became
known worldwide for the worst disaster
in aviation history
curiously the deadliest aircraft crash
occurred while aircraft were on the
ground
the location of the disaster was the los
rodeos airport on the island of tenerife
aircraft engaged were two boeing 747
airliners belonging to the dutch klm
company and the pan am of the united
states
they crashed into each other on the
airport runway on march 27 1977.
the scale of the disaster was enormous
only 61 out of 644 people on both planes
survived
the disaster shocked the world
it was not only the number of casualties
that was disturbing but also the fact
that two aircraft collided on the runway
such incidents were unthinkable even for
low-level airports such as at tenerife
when the dust settled a question arose
how on earth could two planes collide on
the runway without plane crews or the
air traffic controller being aware of
what was going on
two airliners weren't even supposed to
be at the tenerife airport that day
so it was another incident that actually
led to the tenerife disaster
even though they belong to the african
continent the canary islands have been
part of the spanish kingdom since the
spaniards conquered the archipelago in
the early 15th century
the collapse of the spanish colonial
empire didn't affect the status of these
small islands
in the late 1960s a pro-independence
armed movement disputed the spanish
authority over the islands
the maiac
movement for the independence and
self-determination of the canary's
archipelago based in algeria led an
aggressive campaign to win independence
for the canaries
on sunday march 27 1977
mai ac fighters set up an explosive
device on the grand canaria airport at
las palmas
the bomb exploded at 1315 injuring eight
people
the local police immediately raised the
alarm
a couple of minutes later a person
representing himself as a maiac fighter
reported they planted another bomb
the airport had to be closed
what followed was a complete breakdown
of the air traffic above the canaries
grand canary airport was the main
airport for all the airliners
transporting tourists from all over the
world to the archipelago
however
there was no way an aircraft would be
allowed to land with a bomb on site
so instead
they were all diverted to los rodeos
airport on the nearby island of tenerife
los rodeos airport was a much smaller
airport than gran canaria but was the
nearest one and therefore the best
solution to divert all airliners
arriving to the canaries
on march 27 1977 dozens of planes landed
on those rodeos including five large
airliners
among them were two boeing
planes
klm flight 4805 arriving from amsterdam
and pan am flight 1736 coming from los
angeles via new york
los rodeos was by far an inadequate
airport for these planes but there were
no better options in given circumstances
the tenerife airport had a small apron
area inadequate to park all the diverted
aircraft so almost all of them had to
park on the taxiway instead
they therefore used the runway for both
taxiing and takeoff
needless to say how important was the
coordination of the air traffic control
at the airport in given circumstances
everyone at the airport was quite edgy
controllers in the tower cockpit crews
and above all passengers who were eager
to get to their destinations
the fog that descended on the airport
only aggravated the situation
the pan am
captain didn't even want to land at los
rodeos
he wanted to stay in the air in a
holding pattern and wait for gran
canaria to reopen
ultimately he was forced to land his
boeing 747-121
at the tenerife airport
with his crew on duty for 13 hours
captain victor grubbs was anxious to get
out of los rodeos as soon as possible
most of his passengers were seniors and
spending such a long time in their seats
was too big of a burden for them
as soon as he received a message the
grand canary airport was reopened
captain grubbs prepared his plane for
the takeoff
the problem was that between his
aircraft and the runway was the klm's
boeing 747 flight 4805
with no way to bypass it grubbs had no
options but to wait for the dutch plane
to take off first
at 1656 klm 4805 captain jacob felthus
and van zantin asked the control tower
for permission to taxi
the controller cleared the klm captain
to backtrack down to the end of the
runway and take his position for the
takeoff
in the meantime pan am 1736 also asked
permission to taxi down the runway
they were too clear to backtrack on the
main runway but to leave it on the third
taxiway exit to make room for the klm to
take off
it was an awkward decision because pan
am's captain had to make a 148 degrees
turn to get through the third exit
a complex maneuver for a large aircraft
on such a small runway
once on the takeoff position klm 4805
first officer claus muirs radioed the
tower that they were ready for takeoff
and were waiting for the clearance
the tower responded with the takeoff
route instructions
viewers replaced the instructions and
ended his statement with words
we're now at takeoff
captain vanzanten added we're going
the controller responded with okay but
only to confirm that he received a
message
captain vanzanten however misinterpreted
the word thinking he had got a take-off
clearance he failed to receive the other
part of the message the controller sent
them standby for takeoff i will call you
the main reason the klm 4805 crew failed
to receive this message was that all the
planes at the airport used the same
radio frequency to communicate with the
control tower which led to signal
interference
one of them was pan am 1736 transmitting
a message
we're still taxiing down the runway the
clipper
1736 dutch crew failed to record this
message as well
captain van zantin believed he had an
open runway in front of him pushed the
throttles and began his takeoff while
the pan am 1736 was still on the runway
because of thick fog captain grubbs
missed the third taxiway exit and
continued to taxi down the runway the
controller urged him to report as soon
as he had left the runway as klm 4805
was waiting to take off the crew in the
control tower was utterly unaware that
the dutch boeing was already taking off
they had no ground radars to locate the
planes on the runway and the fog was so
dense that they had no clear sight of
the taxiway let alone the runway
after all they were assured klm 4805 was
in place as they gave captain vanzanten
no clearance
captain grubbs did not know klm's plane
was taking off
he noticed klm's landing lights only
when the dutch plane was rushing at full
speed toward them
captain grubbs just exclaimed god damn
that sfb is coming as he applied full
throttle and turned a sharp left trying
to escape from the runway van zantin was
probably surprised as well when he saw
pan am on the runway he was running too
fast to stop so he tried to lift his
plane and clear over the aircraft in
front of him
but
unfortunately planes were too close for
this maneuver to succeed
klm hit the pan am and ripped apart its
fuselage above the wing and behind the
cockpit
fire immediately caught the pan in
because of the spilled fuel that ignited
remained airborne for a few seconds and
then crashed into the ground 500 feet
past the spot where it hit the pan am
and slid for a further 1000 feet
just before the takeoff the klm was
fully refueled
with tanks full the plane burst into a
massive fire upon impact
back at the control tower controllers
heard a series of loud explosions but
were unaware of what was happening
because the dense fog covered the entire
airport
still firefighters and ambulance crews
were given an emergency alarm
a couple of minutes after the collision
an airport worker came running to report
a plane on the runway was on fire
although unaware of the plane's position
the fire crew jumped into action
as they moved along the runway they
bumped into the klm's aircraft engulfed
by fire
at that moment the fog began to clear
and the firefighters noticed another
bright light coming from down the runway
it didn't last long before they realized
another plane was on fire
the entire fire crew then moved to this
location and concentrated their effort
on putting out the fire on the pan am
the klm was firing so vigorously it was
apparent it was gone beyond saving
in the end both planes burned down to
conditions beyond repair
a devastating fire killed all 234
passengers and 14 crew members of the
klm
the number killed inside the pan am was
even larger
317 passengers and nine cabin crew
members
however 70 people from pan am's boeing
survived the crash including the entire
cockpit crew
of this number nine passengers
unfortunately succumbed to their
injuries later
the total number of 583 killed in the
collision made the tenerife airport
disaster the worst in aviation history
the scale of the disaster asked for
thorough research
a commission of 70 investigators from
spain the united states and the
netherlands including kla and pan am was
gathered
after reviewing the recordings the
commission set up three key questions to
determine the reasons for the disaster
first
why did captain van zantin begin to take
off without the control tower's
clearance
second
why did the control tower instruct
captain grubbs to exit the runway via
the third exit instead of the fourth
exit which was more suitable and why did
grubbs fail to comply with these
instructions
finally why did the klm crew neglect pan
am's message that it still didn't clear
the runway
captain van zantin was the face of the
klm brand their most experienced pilot
and chief flight instructor with 11 700
flight hours of which
1545 hours on boeing
747 investigators found it hard to
believe how an experienced pilot like
him could have made such a mistake
instead they concluded that the
miscommunication with the control tower
led the captain to make a wrong decision
he misunderstood the airway clearance he
was given as a take-off clearance
when the klm crew received the
controller's partial response okay to
their message were now out take off van
zantin opened the throttles and started
to take off
in effect the tower never gave him a
loud and clear takeoff clearance
however if captain grubbs had vacated
the runway through the third exit as
instructed he would have surely avoided
the collision
there are two opinions about why he
failed to do so
either he found the third exit
unsuitable considering he had to make a
sharp turn twice to reach the takeoff
position or he simply failed to notice
the exiting conditions of dense fog
even so captain grubbs messaged the
tower he was still taxiing on the runway
and the klm crew failed to take that
into account when they began to take off
klm's flight engineer however asked van
zantin is he not clear that pan-american
captain simply replied oh yes it seemed
that vanzantin's reputation and
experience in the company were simply
too big to be questioned
after all they probably never even heard
pan am's messages due to signal
interference
in the light of these answers they
blamed captain vanzanten for neglecting
a number of factors that eventually led
to a disaster
the dutch company tried to play down the
spanish report by claiming there were
other factors that caused the collision
they said unfavorable weather conditions
the use of non-standard terminology the
controller's decision to allow two
planes on the runway at the same time
captain grubbs's failure to exit the
runway on time and others too led to
disaster
still
klm had to accept the responsibility for
the collision and pay large
compensations to victims families
the news of the tenerife airport
disaster shocked the world
however it wasn't only the number of
casualties that was terrifying but also
the fact that the disaster could have
been avoided if there had been slightly
better communication between the control
tower and the cockpit crew
the disaster had also disturbed the
entire international airline community
tragedies such as the one at the
tenerife airport had to be avoided at
all costs
the first step the authorities made was
the introduction of standardized phrases
in air traffic communication
for example expression takeoff was to be
used only when the actual takeoff
clearance was given or cancelled that is
cleared for takeoff or cancel takeoff
clearance
they also established english as a
common language and air traffic
communication
changes were brought to cockpit
procedures diminishing the pilot's
authority
first officers and flight engineers were
given the right and were encouraged to
question pilots decisions if they found
them questionable
from then on all the decisions pilots
had to make were in agreement with other
crew members
mistakes caused by a human factor were
something that everyone had to pay
attention to
one word overheard was enough to cause
the loss of hundreds of innocent lives
i hope you found this video interesting
if you did please like and subscribe see
you next time

you ever see that documentary it's old
it's on hbo it's called there's
something wrong with aunt diane

she and her husband
and
their their kid their two kids
and their three nieces yeah were at a
they were like at a campground
the next morning they wake up
he they have breakfast him and his wife
have breakfast coffee together he leaves
drive separate she's taking a van with
the kids home
and then on the way home she freaks out
and drives into oncoming she gets on the
wrong lane of the highway and goes 70
straight down the highway straight into
another car
kills everyone
it makes no sense and then they're like
trying to do this for no reason then
they found a bottle of vodka in the van
and like her blood alcohol was like 0.19
she was [ __ ] hammered and had weed in
her system okay and he they were like
she wasn't a drinker

her that you you don't have the
recording of it but it's like
she was like incoherent not drunk okay
just like saying different words she was
losing her mind she had like delirium
and like
it's terrifying and there's footage
there's like uh
there's footage of her at like a gas
station just walking in totally normal
not [ __ ] up she's like do you have any
tylenol because she was trying to get a
headache and then walked back to her car
then she was at a mcdonald's and the the
guy that talked to me was like yeah i do
remember talking to her she was
definitely not drunk
and then she chugged a bottle of vodka
and drove
not erratically either she wasn't like
driving a rack she just drove straight
down the [ __ ] highway going 70 into
oncoming oh
rude
it was like one of those and then the
yeah man
then they're talking like the the people

they were saying she was like rubbing
her jaw for a while she did have an
abscess tooth she did have okay

caused her to like her brain did they
examine her brain
they well the coroners were just like
the autopsy was like all right 0.19
blood alcohol and that's with a belly
full of vodka that didn't
metabolize yet so it would have been
even higher like she just chugged a
bottle of vodka
and had wheat in her system
and like she didn't smoke or drink like
that
whoa it was weird where'd she get her
hands on weed that quickly i mean i
think she smoked like occasionally this

lingering in our system yeah yeah it
happened in the spud man he had an
abscess he didn't drive his van into
oncoming traffic but he had he had he
had an abscessed tooth and he got like
horrible pain he went down there like
dude if you waited this would have
[ __ ] killed you
because it'll go and infect your brain

actually you'll definitely like it it's
on hbo it's about the girl who texted
that dude into killing himself oh i
heard about that so [ __ ] funny bro i
heard about that the the the prosecutors
like the way they tried to frame it was
like
they brought in all of her high school
friends to be like she was an attention
[ __ ]
everybody hated her her [ __ ] friends
hated her they brought her her friends
from high school onto the stand and they
were like did you have any intention of
hanging out with her this summer
and they're like
no
no your honor i did not like her like
she had all
that's how the state tried to prosecute
her they brought in her friends she
sucks no she was a loser
it's like they're like she sucks enough
to have done this i mean she was a
complete she was a [ __ ] weirdo but it
was interesting because the kid
also was texting her forever that he was
going to kill himself yeah
so one day finally she was like yeah you
should kill yourself
but
there's no law against that you can text
people whatever the [ __ ] there's no
there's no murder for texting someone
what do they give this lady she got
[ __ ] manslaughter what yeah bro but
wasn't she like kill yourself for me
no she was like
he got out of the car while it was
running and she was like stop being a
[ __ ] get back in there and he did it
what but he had told her for like
two years he was going to [ __ ] kill
him but they did all the time
it was long they were like texting
all day every day that's it that's sick
and twisted dude it's wild man
she becomes a cute bae too she was a
little chunky in high school
pro posts like all this clear like
depression anxiety she's pretty hot i
like it she's got a very when she gets
out you would hate her look why
very she looks like a classic wasp [ __ ]
you would hate that i like that's my ant
she looks like a real [ __ ] dude if
she feels like that's who tells people
to kill themselves she would text me and
be like you should kill yourself we
should have connor dated and i know
connor jack her up on the yacht dude
her versus o'connor
he would be dead in a [ __ ] i think he
would kill himself pretty quickly bro
he's close already he thinks so i gotta
i gotta i push him i i push him i might
get charged with the same thing you call
him everybody i call him every day just
kill yourself dude you should think
about killing yourself and they'll
interview you and like [ __ ] happy
like he was really mean to me
yeah if things weren't going well for
him he really took it out on his closest
whoever's the closest to him
in proximity he'll swing it damn dude
yeah this lady is dude you got us you
gotta watch it it's actually really fun
that sounds [ __ ] awesome but they did
that i mean the defense and they all
have this like boston accent that took
place up there so they're all like your
honor there's no law against this you're
honest she's just texting him he's just
telling him
tell me if you pick up on it if you
watch it her attorney
he's trying to [ __ ]
really probably did he loves this girl
prove it bro [ __ ] kill exactly he
should kill himself that she didn't say
for me she just said kill yourself
but she did set herself up to be like
she was like the the the prosecution did
a really good job of being like she did
this for attention
and she did it was weird she did a lot
of stuff she did she had like a did she
go on facebook charity baseball game for
him in her hometown in her hometown not
his
which
it just was all about her what do you do
with that
that's just this is i mean dude this
i mean that [ __ ] back in the day you
would be able to just kill someone for
you're like look we don't mean loss for
this yeah this sucks so bad the [ __ ]
documentary did that dude they were like
they had this one psychiatrist
psychologist on there was like
he had like the exact accent you would
think for this he's like men are afraid
of women
they have been forever like he's like
taught he's like men are afra men fear
women yeah like there used to be witch
trials for this type of thing he's like
men deep down are horrified of women
this is a this is a witch hunt it's
basically what he like
they tried to claim like sexism yeah
it's like no because if this was a dude
we'd be coming down way harder obviously
i'd be crushed there's like a cute girl
that's getting prosecuted i'm just
sitting there like no free her for here
let her go dude she's mine well that was
uh then this is i think i said it wrong
before but i was saying that was spuds
that's what i thought his theory was if
like tulsi gabbard had to debate trump
old dudes wouldn't want to see trump
being mean like a hot young chick they'd
all kind of intrinsically want to kind
of defend her
dog yeah exactly right
looked like everybody's wife and they
were like yo [ __ ] her finish her dude
god finally someone tells this [ __ ]
just shut up
but yeah that was i think i
misrepresented it at the one time and
he's not exactly right his theory was
that
america is like dudes aren't going to
want to watch
like a hot young woman
get like chastised and derided they're
going to happen they're instinctually
like how about you [ __ ] take it easy
with jerseys
kind of [ __ ] happens with jerry's a
lot too like oh
crying on the stand or something the
jury's like oh we believe her
put a bunch of 45 year old fat chicks up
there dude
right it should be the she'll be tarred
and feathered she immediately yeah
they'd bring that back
put her in the stockade
for sure they uh
they went no jury
the judge
no the the girl wanted no they wanted to
know jerry because they were like it was
smart too because the guy the lawyer was
like there's no crime yeah you can't
make up a crime retroactively what she
did wasn't illegal couldn't they do like
a like a landmark case kind of thing
yeah but you can't do that you can't
just decide something's illegal during a
case like that i feel like that could be
negligence on some way because it's like
you could you could argue this is a
mentally ill person and you're
she's mentally ill
true yeah both mentally both and also
minors
oh god yeah she's a minor what was it
would they interview her parents at all
no they were there though you see them i
really think they're
but yeah it's like so she was throwing
like
he the full [ __ ] did she say like my
boyfriend killed himself and i want to
like yeah she was doing facebook
facebook posts of like i'm so [ __ ]
sad oh my god i miss you so much like
all that stuff about him she was getting
the likes dude
what the [ __ ] she's doing exactly how
many likes you get
not many i think she was kind of a loser
people didn't like her
that sucks imagine that i like her i'm
gonna dude if things go well if things
go well career-wise i am gonna try to
date her hey dude that is bae that's the
new kardashian
me i'm gonna find a [ __ ] i forget her
name i gotta find her name
me and this bae are gonna be together
that's a new kardashian dude i'm gonna
start writing her now do it i can just
force like
this link she's in jail now i might send
this link to her be like peep the cast
just get a new test get into it put some
money on her books and get her a cell
phone
well how long have you she's in jail for
not long yeah she'll be honest two years
three years it should be out just in
time for me to be like come on babe
happy birthday i got a place for i got
places to go with you and me oh
i think i'd be a pretty easy target to
talk into suicide so
it took me a second to think about it
all it would take would be like one
conversation i'd be like yeah i guess so
you would call her i'm like i don't know
i'm just kind of stressed she's like
yeah what uh what floor are you on right
now yeah what
it's like i heard falling doesn't hurt
that bad
yeah it would be easy too for like
michelle carter dude me and michelle
carter are gonna be in love especially
as a dude hit like their 40s and 50s the
chick could pretty easily talk you into
killing yourself
yeah
that'd be tough
conrad roy dude i forgot she went
short-haired on this
what do you mean
michelle cut her hair i don't like it
oh man i forgot how crazy her face was
who cut her hair
look at my bed dude
damn what do you think of bae she has
like wasp [ __ ] face just like draco
malfoy she does she absolutely is
slytherin
he is slytherin dude
you don't like her i don't know i mean
what she did is kind of hot talking to
dude into killing himself then taking
all the
oh my god dude yes
i mean i like what she's about
for suicide and then reaping all the
benefits
for suicide then getting online and
being like i'm so sad life's so hard
i'm so hard it's hot
that's hot dude i can get into that
i can get into the deprivation of it all
she's so sad now is she
do you think me and michelle carter are
gonna date for a while for sure
that dude you could really brighten her
day
like everyone makes mistakes we all make
mistakes you sent a bunch of bad texts
i mean how was the thing the guy was
constantly gonna [ __ ] kill myself for
a while for like a yeah and she would be
like no definitely don't definitely
don't like all the time so what was the
switch
uh
i don't know
the [ __ ] psychologist who is clearly
[ __ ] defending sure came up with some
good answers
yeah
she was in a delusional state also and
thought she was helping
could be
slightly and then she was like i might
as well reap all the benefits yeah then
it's like she sure snapped out of it
right away
dude i uh this is becoming this is about
my favorite time of year man it's cold
the base dude i was laughing the other
day like the cold days i'm thinking
about having babies bundled up
that and how like watching my favorite
thing i i think around the same time
this year i was talking about this dude
baez walking to work early in the
morning and how do just like feminism
does not exist before noon dude oh man
you catch a bae in like 42 degrees

it's a new experience peterson got
crushed when they were like well you're
saying men and women can't work together

it hasn't been demonstrated we don't
know yet it's okay to find out it's very
new people are like how dare you uh
native american uh men farmed
and women hunted yes like
you saw that dude what was the point of
that dude it's it's

that lady remember the lady who killed
her kids or was like accused of killing
her kids a while back
everyone hated her and like she kept
being found out like partying and stuff
casey anthony casey and he killed her
daughter yeah she's she's
she's a she's a bad girl she's a looker
i i do like her i like the way she
handled what's good with her they let

she clearly was unburdened and free yeah
that's the sickest of the sick
did you hear another uh
another duck boat accident hit
in missouri yeah yeah 17 dead dudes yeah
philly had we had our own little duck
boat problem
people are still going out on them
i love dog boats i've never been on one
i mean i don't know if i trust them
anymore
there's been a lot of duck but it's like
definitely not the leading cause of
death in america but it's like it's up
there it's about thirty four dollars
as far as modes of transportation go
you're very likely to die on a duck boat
well i'd say you should just
keep cars out of water in general
there's a good chance if you drive a car
in the water whether it's duck whether
it's an amphibious vehicle or not your
kids are in the back seat and you just
roll it into a lake that too you're a
mom i wonder if they thought they just
their vehicle was amphibious
those those moms those distraught
mothers
man that's so [ __ ] up that's the
gamble you take with the chick man
she might kill your kids
true there's a lot of talk like every a
lot of stand-up comedians like have
jokes like we trust men not to kill us
because that's the leading cause of
death it's like yeah well we also trust
you guys to we leave you alone with our
kids and you might drown them and you
might toss them in the microwave you
don't have dads doing that dude
well they beat them
dads will [ __ ] the kids dad's got a
whole other that don't make love to the
kids dad's got a whole other agenda but
the [ __ ] [ __ ] fight i'm not saying
dads are perfect
they might play a secret game they might
play the secret game women for some
reason just i don't i don't know what
that is they might play tickle monster
they might play ticket monster dude but
mom mom's playing
you know hold your breath hold your
breath yeah baptisms were originally
what you hold someone underwater and to
the point where they're about to pass
out and then you bring them up you'd
give them a near-death experience and
pop them out of the water really who
told you that
uh just an audiobook i was listening to
about lsd therapy no big deal

[Music]
on the 11th of July 1929 crowds gathered
in Gillingham Park in Gillingham England
they were there to witness a
demonstration of modern firefighting and
fire rescue techniques laid on by the
town's fire brigade it was to be a
fitting climax for the town's summer
fate
or so they thought nobody watching from
the crowd imagined that the
demonstration they would see that night
would end up being far more real and far
more deadly than they
anticipated Gillingham is an English
town situated to the east of London in a
county called
Kent like many towns and cities in this
County Gillingham has a long and Rich
history which stretches back almost a
thousand years it is named after an
ancient warlord named gillus which means
one who shouts in Old English he was
known for leading his men into battle
with a great deal of screaming and
swearing Gillingham is situated on the
banks of the river Medway close to where
it flows out into the Tempest and the
Sea throughout its long history this has
made it of great importance as a
maritime settlement for many hundreds of
years Gillingham shared an important
dockyard with its neighboring town of
chattam by the 1900s this had become a
naval base where submarines and other
military vessels were built and launched
during World War
I the town in 1929 was thriving it had
been growing steadily for many years
merging with and absorbing neighboring
towns and
Buras it had a lively social calendar
one highlight of which was the summer
fate held each year in Gillingham
Park the Fate proceeds of which would
support a local hospital would last for
two days with a range of entertainment
including music performances food and
drink on the final day a climactic
performance would take place courtesy of
the local fire brigade this annual
tradition had grown up over several
years during the 1920s and generally
followed a similar pattern each year two
prominent local firefighters would dress
up as a pantomim bride and groom then
spend the day mingling with the crowd
and collecting
donations
at the end of the day the crowd would
gather for a mock wedding reception
which would take place in a
purpose-built structure made from wooden
scaffolding and canvas this rudimentary
house was supposed to be the marital
home of the newly wedded firefighters
but of course it had another purpose it
would also allow their colleagues to
demonstrate their firefighting and
rescue
skills with the happy couple inside
smoke bombs would be set off and torches
would be lit to create a flickering
light lights behind the canvas and give
the impression that the building was on
fire the couple would cry out for help
and their colleagues would come running
to carry out a spectacular pantomim
rescue
operation once they were safely removed
the whole structure would be set on fire
for real and the crowd would watch as
the mock house turned into a bonfire
which would of course be kept safely
under control by those same local
firefighters over the years as this
tradition became more and more
embellished local youth organizations
like the naval Cadets and sea Scouts had
gotten involved and would allow some
young members to stand in as wedding
guests they would join the fake bride
and groom in the house and would each be
rescued in turn during the
demonstration by the evening of the 11th
of July 1929 the last day of the 1929
fate everything was in place the house
that year was a three-story 12 M or 40
foot tall wooden scaffold covered with
canvas and stocked with barrels of
paraffin and wood chips on the ground
floor to ensure that it would burned
quickly and well at around 10: p.m. six
men mostly firefighters in fancy dress
and nine boys mostly Naval Cadets and
sea Scouts took their places inside the
children were between 10 and 14 years
old at around 10:15 p.m. Flames shot up
from the bottom of the building quickly
engulfing it the men and boys within
waved theatrically and cried out for
help entreating the audience to summon
the fire brigade many people watching
laughed and clapped enjoying what they
believed was an unusually Grand and
realistic firefighting
demonstration in fact however the Flames
that now engulfed the fake house were
very very
real different people in the crowd
realized that something was wrong at
different times the members MERS of the
fire brigade outside the house poised
for a mock rescue were among the first
to realize that the flames and the cries
for help were real They seized hoses and
ladders and rushed to try and deliver
people from the now blazing wooden
structure others in the crowd only
understood the reality of the situation
when they saw some of those inside the
scaffold jump from the upper
floors exf firefighter Royal Mitchell
who had been dressed as a clown for the
event leapt from the house with his
clothing on fire landed in a heap found
his feet and ran to a nearby trough of
water plunging bodily into it to
extinguish the Flames that burned him he
did all of this with his wife and
daughter watching in horror from the
crowd he was taken to hospital where he
survived for 30 hours before passing
away the next day with his wife at his
side he died in the same hospital that
the Fate had been intended to raise
money
for sea Scout Leonard win just 13 years
old had little time to react when the
building caught fire he ran to the edge
of the roof and jumped but despite this
quick reaction was unable to escape
severe
burns he was found by his own father who
had raced to Gillingham Park in his car
as soon as he heard what had happened
despite being transported to hospital
Leonard would not
survive in his final hours he complained
little despite his injuries and asked
repeatedly about the fate of his fellow
sea
Scouts fireman John Tabet ran into the
burning structure to try and rescue some
of the children but was unsuccessful and
perished in the fire fireman Francis
Caine was inside the house when it
caught fire and stayed long enough to
pick up two children one under each arm
before jumping to safety neither fireman
cocaine nor the the two boys he carried
when he jumped
survived because the fire brigade was on
the scene already with firefighting
equipment prepared the Flames were
extinguished in just 5 minutes but the
damage was already done 13 people had
passed away in those 5 minutes and two
more would die of their injuries in the
days which
followed the dead were 13-year-old Scout
Reginald Barrett 12-year-old Cadet David
brunning
12-year-old Cadet Eric
Cheeseman 10-year-old Cadet Leonard
SS 11-year-old Scout Iva
cinden 13-year-old Scout William
Spinx 14-year-old Robert
Usher 13-year-old Scout Leonard win
13-year-old Leslie Neil 52-year-old
fireman Francis cocaine 37-year-old
fireman Royal
Mitchell 56-year-old fireman Albert
Nichols 37-year-old officer John
nutton 40-year-old fireman Arthur Tabet
and 30-year-old Frederick
warl an inquest was held to determine
what had gone wrong and to devise ways
to prevent a similar disaster in the
future despite extensive investigation
though it could not be determined why
the fire had started early it was
concluded that the whole basis of the
demonstration had been hazardous and
that lives should not have been put at
risk for this purpose in the first
place at the time demonstrations of a
similar nature were popular around the
country no such demonstration was ever
held in Gillingham again and many other
similar demonstrations around the
country were also cancelled as news of
the disaster
spread the victims of the fire were
buried in a mass ceremony on the 17th of
July before the the burial they were
carried through the streets of
Gillingham in a solemn procession those
who had some connection to the Navy were
carried on gun carriages While others
were carried by fire engines adorned
with the helmets of Fallen
firefighters thousands of people
attended filling the streets of
Gillingham 400 firefighters from around
the country 500 Sea Scouts and 200
Sailors took part in the
procession the disaster had a
significant impact on the small
community of Gillingham the loss of so
many young lives all at once was one of
the greatest losses felt by the
community during the inter War period
the loss would be commemorated forever
in 2011 when a relative of someone lost
in the fire raised funds for the
restoration of the graves and the
installation of a
memorial the fireman's wedding at the
1929 Gillingham fate had been intended
as a fun and spectacular demonstration
of the local fire brigades
abilities ultimately it cost 15 people
their lives and forever changed the
trajectory of dozens of families living
in
Gillingham though its impact was
terrible it remains a part of the town's
long history ensuring that those who
died will not be
[Music]
forgotten
[Music]
a

have I ever told you the story of The
Old Man and the young boy
well you see the young boy walks up to
the old man and says I want to see the
world
the old man laughs
no you don't
the young boy was surprised by his
answer he said yes yes I do you've seen
the world why wouldn't I
the old man calmly replied because you
don't travel the world to see it
go to Iceland to see it
you go to Iceland to know what it means
to breathe fresh air
even when it takes your breath away
altogether
go to understand how the Earth was made
and feel that power for yourself
[Music]
you don't go to the Faroe Islands to see
them
you go to know what it's like to stand
at the edge of the world
go to meet the locals
foreign
[Music]
you go to grow closer to the wind
you don't go to the deserts of Utah just
to see them
you go to be one with time itself
and listen closely to the sound of
nothing
[Music]
you go to get a little dirty
and taste the freedom of a road so open
it never existed in the first place
don't go to Patagonia
[Music]
to go to experience one of the last true
wildernesses
and exist with nature in its purest form
[Music]
you see we don't travel simply to see
the world
but to feel it
[Music]
to know it
to live it
we travel to understand what it means to
be a part of it
and that
is why you should go
because I promise you
[Music]
you want so much more
than to see the world
hi I appreciate you making it all the
way to the end of the video if you made
it to the end you must have liked it a
little bit this was something I put
together mostly because I was just in my
head and wanted to edit something and
feel creative again so I came up with
this concept and put this together and
it felt good not gonna lie uh this video
is sponsored by myself so if you didn't
know I just released my brand new
immersion Lut collection in partnership
with gamut which is my first ever
digital product that I've ever released
I've only ever uh sold turtlenecks on
this channel so I was very nervous about
putting together a digital product and I
wanted to do it right and so I partnered
with the team over at gamut who has
years of experience putting together
professional high quality level Luts and
this pack in particular focuses on
Travel and Adventure footage and making
it as simple and easy as possible to
take your footage from point A to a very
powerful and intense captivating look as
easy as possible whether you're brand
new to coloring or you're just someone
who wants to speed up your workflow
that's exactly what these are made for a
lot of times these Luts in the travel
World make your skin tones really orange
the classic teal and orange look and
your footage just kind of falls apart
because it's just overly saturated
we really wanted to make these look very
natural very powerful at the same time
and so skin tones hold together
extremely well that was an absolute must
for the collection and people seem
to be liking them a lot so far here are
just some of the reviews that people
have sent over uh about the luck
collection and it's something we spent a
very long time on it is 95 which I know
some of you might think is very
expensive but I personally think it is
extremely worth it one not only because
of the quality of the Luts but you
actually get an entire color grading
workshop on how to implement the Luts to
best suit your needs and I think that in
and of itself is worth the money so if
you want to support me this is the best
possible way you could do it and um yeah
hopefully these just kind of allow me to
make less sponsored videos and allow me
to just make more fun cinematic travel
films like this so grab the immersion
collection it helps a ton and I promise
you it will look good on your footage I
would love to see what you guys make
with it so um that's it
I love you I'm tired
but I'm glad I got another video out
stick around me guys

[Music]
the countryside of the northeastern
congo
is beautiful and the soil is rich and
fertile
and yet the people here live in poverty
and constant fear of attack by armed
militias
over 120 such groups have been operating
for more than two decades
on the territory of the democratic
republic of the congo
along its northern borders to south
sudan uganda
and rwanda neither the government nor
tens of thousands of u.n peacekeepers
have been able to stop them and the
people suffering
inevitably leads to more suffering as
victims join one rebel group or the
other
they killed my father they killed
everyone in my family
that's the only reason i became a
fighter
a woman grieves for her murdered child
an all-too-common sight in the
northeastern congo
the militias killed around 2000 people
here in 2020 alone
the worst of them called themselves the
allied democratic forces or adf
they're islamist rebels who've been
terrorizing the local population for
some
30 years
they kill people with bullets they kill
people with machetes
they killed my brother with machetes
the islamists attack every few days
often under cover of darkness
they leave devastation behind burned out
houses and beheaded corpses
the local people feel like the congolese
army and the u.n peacekeepers have
abandoned them
we joined up with a u.n patrol in benny
one of the trouble spots
attacks by the adf on the civilian
population here
have been on the increase in recent
months
the u.n patrol checks up on a clinic in
maemoa
it's been a frequent target of adf
attacks
imbusaki wuhua is the clinic's director
the militia comes here and massacres
people if you saw the sheer hatred that
drives the killing
they chop heads off and you find the
brains all around
and chopped off feet that leaves you
terrified
and traumatized
once the islamists tried to abduct four
of his nurses
they took them hostage in the waiting
area when the people there realized it
was the adf
they were scared but then the militia
said nobody would die
it wasn't a day for killing
many in the area live in fear u.n
soldier bosisiwa isaacs knows the clinic
and the people who work there very well
as you can see other nurses cannot
really wear their nursing uniform
because when they are attached and
identified they are the ones that are
targeted to be killed first
hence when they come to work they have
to dress like everybody else
the constant threat level keeps the
clinic closed all but a few hours a day
many patients are left without treatment
they struggle with food they cannot go
and plow they cannot go and farm
they have to stay at home they cannot
move the children cannot go to school
so far the u.n force has failed to
establish and maintain security
often enough the more than 18 000 troops
from nearly 50 nations
can hardly even get themselves
coordinated many of them are
inadequately trained or at least
not trained with the relevant skills the
local villagers aggravate the problems
with often
unjust accusations that the u.n troops
are a pack of thieves
only concerned with their own safety
many of the congolese no longer put
any hopes in the u.n troops at all
and the local people too often find
themselves caught between fronts when
their daughters and sons
actually join the adf so the parents end
up cooperating with the rebels
supplying them food for example in
return they're left in peace
but if they refuse they may be killed
sometimes we're content sometimes we're
afraid
the militias can show up anytime they've
become part of our daily lives
most of the local people are afraid to
appear before the camera
one man who didn't want to say his name
gives vent to his frustration
the government should help or the
international community should help our
government with this situation
so many people have suffered the adf's
got to be finished
in the meantime the adf keeps on
murdering
as soon as the camera's off many people
here say the soldiers come too late
only once the attack's over and people
are already dead
we meet jaribu muliwavio a local
representative who's been studying the
adf for years
in his view the u.n mission has not
achieved its goals
the communities here really ought to be
secured according to my research as many
as 4
500 people have been killed right under
the un forces noses
and what's their job again to protect
the civilian population
but more are getting killed every day
the adf was founded as an islamist group
in uganda in the early 1990s
experts have estimated their current
strength at a few hundred fighters
they're seen as exceptionally cruel and
intent on establishing
islamic sharia law in the territory they
control
they want to create a space a grey area
where the state has no authority
they intend to control this area and
exploit it
it's what they call the islamic state of
central africa
the caliphate of central africa they've
already set it up
to them this state is already up and
running
in march 2021 the united states
designated the adf
a terrorist organization with ties to
the islamic state
but some observers doubt the two groups
maintain any direct contact
besides the adf over 120 other militias
are active in the eastern congo
after the 1994 genocide in neighboring
rwanda
some hutu militias fled to the congo and
kept on killing
that prompted the formation of armed
groups originally
for purposes of self-defense they do not
make it easy to contact them
to do so we had to leave the area under
central government control
halfway there militia fighters meet up
to lead us to one of their bases
among them is mama faida she joined the
militia about 20 years ago
after an armed group massacred her
family she was forced to watch as the
men killed her parents with machetes
then six of the men raped her she was
only 15 years old at the time
i felt defeated
[Music]
so i decided to become a fighter and
drive them out
when a former teacher came to her
village to recruit young people for a
new militia
she joined him many of its members have
experienced
similar horrors it is in essence a
militia of traumatized and emotionally
scarred people
they killed my father they killed
everyone in my family
that's the only reason i became a
fighter
her own community cast her out because
she'd been raped
too great was the stigma the militia
offered her a chance to take revenge
and to survive they control around 20
villages in the region
protecting the inhabitants who in return
keep them supplied with food
it's a simple trade security for food
but we got the impression it wasn't
always a voluntary arrangement
mama faida didn't speak openly until we
moved some distance from the others
heard that others are fleeing the group
but how could i run away i have nobody
to help me
i don't own any land i don't have anyone
who could help me build a new life
now she places all her hopes on her
children her hope that one day
they'll have a choice
with the blessings of god i might at
least arrange for them to get an
education
if they are blessed at least that
i myself will never be able to do any
other job
i can't help them by myself
[Music]
hardly any other region has suffered
atrocities by the militias
as badly as the congo's ituri province
we go on the road with the norwegian aid
organization
over a distance of just 60 kilometers we
pass through about 20 checkpoints of
various rebel groups
as well as the congolese military
by the side of the road a few are
carrying guns though concealing them
often they ask for money as they are
doing here
but a few words convince them to wait
for another day
is a camp for internally displaced
people
it's one of many in the congo about five
and a half million
of the country's 105 million people are
displaced
more than anywhere else in africa logo
gioro barely escaped her village when a
militia attacked it
she was on the run with her children
when she realized her daughter was
missing
i decided to go back to find and save
her i was convinced she was still
alive but unfortunately she was already
dead
i was so sad just devastated
when i walked past them they shot at me
i had no idea if i'd survive
i gradually lost all my strength i
heaved and was breathing harder and
harder
then i slipped into some bush i didn't
really have any hope anymore
i was sure i was going to die
she survived but her four-year-old
daughter was murdered
as soon as the hospital released her she
gathered her other five children
and fled to this camp
even if food water and medical care are
in short supply
at least they are safe here
many people here have stories like logo
joros to tell
they live in desperation and resignation
the trauma runs deep
and like logo joro although they don't
have the money to send them to school
they still put their hope in their
children and so another generation
is growing up without education as easy
potential recruits
for the militias
[Music]
bye

[Music]
uh
[Music]
so when they said uh and the new so
throughout training camp that was the
saying like my trainer eggman and the
new the new world champion and he just
stuck in my head and i thought i got
this
i probably had about five percent chance
winning that fight like i said nobody
believed i was going to win that fight
but i studied him for a long long time
growing up i watched this guy
sammy
big respect to him mr legend
and uh
i was very confident i shouldn't have
been confident because i had 15 fights
and then yeah i took it at both hands
[Applause]
nice little stepping elbow there from
jonathan hagerty as he meets him on the
body now trying to [ __ ] tie this pop
multi-top world champion
[Music]
you know what was i like when you when
you raised it in the air i'm real
i had my family and my granddad my
friends
i came out to singapore
with my granddad to be there he's my
number one fan
and to win in front of him which run in
front of everyone really
the best thing was the gold confetti at
the end when it just came down i just
thought i had a broken nose as well
broke my nose in the second round i
couldn't breathe
and uh my trainer was laughing at me in
the corner my dad was laughing at me in
the corner get on my right come on i
can't breathe out my nose
so i just gotta get on with it now and
um
the best night of my life
so after that fight i broke my like i
said i broke my nose my foot was my feet
were mangled my elbows i couldn't
straighten them
um
[Music]
i was i was feeling a lot of pain after
the fire but when i had the belt wrapped
around me i took the pain away i got
rushed into hospital on a hospital bed
and um
i was i was hurt a lot hurt and uh
my trainer said i had my belt on me and
then checked my trainer took it off i
said no no i need that belt yeah i feel
pain-free when i've got that around me
on that bed with the belt at your feet
was it worth it um 100
and you know what what made it the
better they wheeled in my opponent on
the other hospital bed and we both he
doesn't speak english obviously from
thailand sami we both looked at each
other and went
and and it was just it was a it was a
war
it was a great fight it was uh
i felt like training was lying to me
because i remember before a message one
championship like a few years ago saying
great show i've still got the dm on my
phone
great show i would love to be a part of
it one day didn't get back to me
unfortunately
but then they realized and then um so
when i won the world title now
i went back onto the onto our chat and
one championship and i looked at that
message saying i'd love to be a part of
it
and that's when it comes to real life i
knew what i wanted and i achieved it
so i went in the belt and then um i
called out the best in the world because
i think if you're going to be the best
you've got to fight the best
people must have thought i was mad when
i called out uh rob tang chipmunk
the most feared tire boxer in the world
everyone would tell you
i called him out big mistake
he tipped my belt
i want to be the best so i got to beat
the best and to lose the belt against
him the first time
it was a bit controversial i thought i
won
he won obviously and um
it was devastating i was heartbroken i
was heartbroken but i didn't let it get
to me too much
they offered me the rematch
i turned it down so i'm not ready yet
turn it down i trained for an extra two
three months got my head right again
i said yeah i'm ready now
and then i had the rematch
and he defeated me by tko in the second
round
my mind wasn't really there you know it
wasn't really there i don't know why i
can't explain but um
i was devastated
but now on my way back
just got my first win back from off that
loss against tacky nato
two more wins i'd say and i'll
i'll get that belt back
so i'm jonathan hagerty former one fly
away world champion
three times muay thai world champion
uk born and raised i grew up in areas
kind of rough around here and uh
all of my friends sort of went the wrong
path but i sort of kept on the straight
and narrow
thanks to my parents
opened up a gym
yeah my dad was an mma fighter
originally and that's what got me into
it
he knows where he wants me to be and he
to guide he guided me the right path
and um
yeah he's a
he's a role model to me
without him i don't think anything could
have could have happened
i was about seven
seven six
as soon as soon as really
[Music]
never had a job
growing up as a kid it's always been
fighting i was just in the gym from a
young age so that was it really i had no
choice but to
succeed in the fighting mode
so um as a junior i didn't have much
fights in thai boxing juniors normally
have loads of fights like literally a
hundred fighters juniors i had about
four and then i got pushed into taking
my shin guards off
get pushed straight into the swing of
things then and um
i started fighting men at a young age
and my dad wasn't very keen on it but my
trainer was sort of he knew i could do
it so he pushed me and then from then
onwards i started knocking him out so it
started getting real started getting to
the rankings it was men when i was like
17 18.
i remember one time i had to lie about
my age to fight a man
nobody believed in me and thought i'm
just a silly kid i think i still had
braces on
and
i got in there he was number one for 10
years and i stopped him in round two
and i think that's when everyone started
to believe like this guy's the real deal
that was it i just knew from then that's
what i wanted to do
you just gotta believe in yourself you
know and uh i grew up with everyone but
around me my team around me kept by
pushing into my ears you're the one like
you're gonna be the best
and uh from then onwards i just thought
i'm gonna go to the top
i was five i was 14 i had 14 fights
and then there was um
all the promotions will get me to fight
the best tires in the world
and in my head when he was offering me
these fights i was thinking no i don't
want to fight
i had 14 fights i'm still basically a
beginner
but i took them
and uh i took risks and i prospered
the night before you can't you can't
sleep at all you know i woke up the next
morning one of these fights against one
of the best tires in the world
i woke up that morning to fight i had no
speech i was so nervous i couldn't speak
i had no speech and then um
as soon as you get into the arena
you're in the back room and you can
smell the thai oil as soon as you smell
that you see other people warming up you
think yeah it's going on now there's no
going back
you want to run out you can't you just
gotta get on with
it so now you're stepping up to the
stage to walk out to the fight the crowd
of that thousand fifteen hundred people
and it's very nerve-wracking is it's uh
it's very nerve-wracking as soon as you
step over them ropes
and you touch gloves
you've got no feeling in your body you
hit they hit you you can't feel it you
hit them you can't feel it one thing
you can just about he'll hear anything
apart from the my coach christian knows
he got the biggest mouth in the room
and that's all i hear and it's just go
time from there killer instinct just
kicking
[Music]
when i think of fear i think of uh my
body shaking adrenaline and just block
it out
just block it out like i said getting in
that ring is
it's very fear it's a lot of fear
[Music]
getting past that
i need fear to fight i fight better with
fear i deal with it after the fight in
the fight if you feel in pain
you can't show that you're right
otherwise you're they'll capitalize on
that
you need to just
get on with it after the fact you can
crawl you want
[Music]
a lot of things that you could be doing
fun ways
but you need to have your priorities
straight
and be where you want to be
[Music]
more excited we call it the art of eight
limbs you've got your feet your knees
your elbows your punches everything
[Music]
because one elbow just slip through
it's a game changer every time you step
in that ring there's not a possibility
you could step back out
and um put your life on the line i'm
fighting the best in the world and
fighting people with 300 fights it's no
joke so you need to be fully prepared
[Laughter]
[Music]
i've had three losses
i've learned more than them on them
three losses and i have any of the wins
you know so i lost one
came back stronger i won i lost another
one got signed to one championship so
open up doors for me made me realize as
well like i am beatable and um i'm
coming up against the best in the world
now
yeah you know sometimes there's setbacks
minor setbacks major comebacks that's my
one of my sayings
so if anything's going wrong
it's hard to say don't worry about it
but things will get right fit into place
just uh just keep going strong
i'm hitting to hurt
um
i want to take you out every shot i will
take i want to take you out i want to
hurt you severely
it's as evil as it sounds but that's
that's the reality of it
but after the fight we can uh we can be
friends
when we're in that ring
it doesn't matter who it is
this is game time
i turned everything down i missed out
once we were partying like
uh sacrifices i stopped everything
to get to where i wanted to be and it
paid off
i know you do need to sacrifice
you can't do
partying or whatever
you need to be level headed on one goal
this is basically my life man this is
basically my life
[Music]
what like what does it mean to get that
belt back it means uh
it means the world mate to be fair but i
need to get that belt back before i move
on type of stuff one championship is the
pioneer of martial arts so it's it's the
belt everyone wants to have
uh he's the only uk
um thai boxer to get that title and have
that title you're not gonna rest easy
until it's done no no way i think two
more two more knockouts
and then uh
hopefully we'll be back on track again
the one championship belt
would you say that's an obsession
obsession obsessed
i think that's the belt that is
obviously the belt that everybody wants
and i've had and i've lost
so i want it more than anything now
again
i'm a i'm a fighter and um
that is the pinnacle of my tire so why
not be obsessed to get in that belt i
don't think there's nothing wrong with
it
i think once the whole company won
championship everybody wants to be on
that you know everybody's screaming i
want to be on one championship
and for at the such young age that i got
on it on that big stage
that motivated me the most you know
people look up to me young kids now i
train a group of young kids i've got a
few world champions
14 year olds
they look up to me i'm their role model
so that that pushes me on more you know
for them to see what i can do and uh
so they can achieve that as well
just keep going just keep aiming for you
know keep digging away you foul you go
get back do what you do best and if you
want it as much as you you say you want
it you'll get
you know i want this belt as much as i
want it and uh
i'll do everything i can to get that
belt back
if it means getting up at five in the
morning twelve k runs
you go up it's gotta be done
i don't believe in failure
it's lessons learned in it really
you foul it's a learning curve
it's another opportunity to get back and
win i just think tomorrow will be better
tomorrow will be better and i don't have
that one championship belt in no time
got a few few steps to climb
i'm on my way
i'm on my way there
and i'll get there
i'll sign an mma contract with one
2022
i would also do muay thai
and i'll be the white tower champion and
mma one championship world champion
within five years
before that really yeah
two years now i'm gonna be walking in
places and everyone's like just that
that's that guy that's jonathan
that's what i want to start working for
you know to be the best
next fight is um 20th of november in
ireland
isk world title
against alpha mile
i see that
ko round two
you
you

today i want to give you a step-by-step
guide for 35 millimeter film photography
i'm going to cover everything from
choosing the right camera loading the
film and shooting
if you've already got a camera and are
just looking for a specific piece of
information feel free to skip through
the different chapters of this video
let's begin
[Music]
before even getting into cameras and
films i think it's a good idea for you
to get a basic understanding of what
film photography is and how it works
put very simply this here is film and
it's basically just plastic with a
magical mix of chemicals on it that is
sensitive to light when the roll of film
is inside the camera it is in complete
darkness every time you shoot a photo
you are essentially letting in light
through your lens and that then hits the
film that light sort of burns the
chemicals that are on the film in a way
that shapes and colours are reflected on
the material so after developing you can
then look at your photos on the film and
see how the material was burnt by the
light that is more or less how film
photography works
so next it's time to get a camera maybe
you've already got a camera passed down
to you from your parents or grandparents
this here is my dad's old pentax k1000
which he bought back in the 80s and then
carried around the world with him on his
trips if you don't have a film camera
yet you should know about the three main
types of film cameras so that you can
choose the one that best suits you
basically you have a choice between an
slr a rangefinder and a point shoot
let's briefly go over each one
an slr camera gives you the option to
change lenses and shoot manually what
you see when looking through the
viewfinder is very close to the actual
image thanks to the internal mirror
mechanism a rangefinder camera on the
other hand has a different type of
viewfinder which in my opinion is the
most significant difference what you see
in the viewfinder of a rangefinder is
not exactly what you get instead you
have frame lines which can assist you
when composing this can be especially
tricky when you decide to shoot with
longer focal lengths seeing as the image
through the viewfinder will not change
whereas the slr camera will show you the
view through the lens something worth
mentioning when it comes to rangefinders
is that not all of them allow you to
change your lens and when it is possible
that usually means the camera is more
expensive however if you like compact
small size rangefinders can usually
offer you a smaller setup than slrs
lastly point shoot cameras are as the
name suggests automatic cameras that
only require you to point the camera and
shoot the photo you don't need to set
the exposure yourself and often you
don't need to focus but this depends on
the camera this minolta is fully
automatic
the exposure the focusing even the film
advancing everything
[Music]
this olympus xa3 however only exposes
automatically the focus you have three
different settings here that you can
choose from and the film advancing is
with this wheel here
so these are the three types of cameras
that you'll mostly come across and it
fully depends on you and your situation
which type of camera you should choose
here are two examples you're interested
in photography and even practice it
digitally already but now you want to
get into film photography you value
precision when composing and you want to
be able to freely change lenses anytime
in that case an slr is probably the best
fit for you but let's say you're more
interested in easily capturing moments
in your everyday life or while traveling
and the moment and the emotions are more
important to you then maybe a
point-and-shoot is better for you
because with an slr you're going to want
to take your time when shooting
one more thing to consider is the
following slrs and many range finders
are fully mechanical cameras whereas i
believe most point-and-shoot cameras are
electronic this means that the
mechanical cameras do not require a
battery to shoot whereas for
point-and-shoot cameras you're going to
have to find the right battery for the
camera
alright so with this basic understanding
of the cameras it is now time to get one
i personally always do this in private
second-hand markets so here in austria i
go to a website where people sell their
stuff they don't need anymore and i've
often come across great deals on there
however one drawback with this method is
that you can never be sure that the
camera actually works some people just
found the camera in their grandad's
attic and don't know themselves whether
it works or not so this camera for
example i got from that kind of a person
and unfortunately there seems to be some
problem with the shuttle so and it is
not working at least i haven't been able
to use it so far
an alternative and safer way to buy your
film camera is at a professional camera
shop where they sell old second-hand
film cameras the experts in the shop
have tested the camera and know that it
works so that's a bit of certainty for
you however what is also certain is that
this is going to be more expensive
obviously seeing as it has been checked
by professionals
anyway whichever way you get your camera
it's then time to understand it
[Music]
if you've never held a film camera
before it might seem a bit overwhelming
at first sight in this video i can't
really explain the workings of a camera
very well because there are just so many
different types of cameras each with
variations in the way they work here's a
very broad breakdown of the basic things
that'll apply to almost all cameras for
further information you can usually find
something on your specific camera on
youtube but that of course depends on
its popularity
so for the broad example i'm going to
show you my pentax k1000 this button is
the shutter to shoot your photo but
before you can shoot a photo you need to
advance the film to do that you pull
this lever so when i pull this the film
is pulled over sideways to allow a new
empty frame to be exposed once it's in
position the lever will no longer go
further and the camera will now allow
you to press the shutter
this knob is like on digital cameras
simply the shutter speed on the pentax
you can pull up this outside ring and
turn it to change the iso rating i'll
explain what you need this for later
this here is the counter which tells you
how many shots you've shot so that you
know how many you have left on the roll
this thing over here is a foldable lever
and a knob to wind the film back into
its canister after shooting the whole
roll many slrs also use this to open the
back of the camera so you simply pull
this up and the back will pop open
these were all things that you'll
probably find on all slrs but for
further detail you have to look on
youtube or elsewhere online
now that you understand the basics of
your camera it's time to get a roll of
film
[Music]
here again you have a wonderful choice
of all sorts of films which differ in
characteristics such as colour and
contrast one thing you must be careful
of is that you buy the right format this
video is specifically for 35 millimeter
film so the cameras i've shown you are
also all 35 millimeter cameras which is
the most common however many
photographers also like to shoot medium
format which is simply a bigger size of
film so when buying film you just want
to make sure that you're buying 35
millimeter film not 120 or something
because that won't fit into your 35
millimeter camera to check the format
you just need to read the packaging and
it'll be written on there somewhere
when choosing your film there are
basically two variables that you need to
consider firstly what style do you want
and secondly what price are you willing
to pay
yeah film photography nowadays has
become very expensive i recently just
bought my first roll of portrait and
this here cost me 24 euros
for a beginner i would recommend going
with kodak gold 200 which is a cheapish
color film so that you don't spend too
much money on film that might suffer
from the many mistakes that happen when
starting out for black and white i can
recommend akfa apx400 which is also
quite affordable in fact i think it's
the cheapest film i've found so far
[Music]
so now that you've got a camera and a
roll of film it is time to load the film
and prepare your camera to shoot this is
again a unique process depending on each
camera so the best is to search for your
exact model on youtube and you'll
probably find someone who's done a
tutorial on it but most cameras are
quite similar so maybe after watching
the way i load my pentax you'll be able
to figure it out yourself for your
camera without a tutorial
point-and-shoot cameras can be quite
different to slr's rangefinders so this
minolta for example you simply open the
back lay the film in and close it again
and it'll do the rest itself but slrs
aren't as simple here's how it works on
the pentax
so to begin with you of course need to
open the back of your camera and with
slrs it's usually like this that you
insert your film here and then push this
down again to hold the film in place
then you take the leader and pull it out
a little more to bring it over to this
side just as a reminder film is light
sensitive so every bit you pull out is
going to be unusable so try to avoid
pulling out more than necessary
then this part over here is what is
usually different depending on each
camera the pentax has a small slot where
you stick your leader into and then you
use the lever to advance it
[Music]
make sure that the sprocket holes align
with the sprocket so that the film is
advanced properly then by pulling the
lever and pressing the shutter you can
advance the film until you're certain
that it's working once you're sure that
the film is in you can close the back to
make sure that the advancing is working
you can keep an eye on this knob here if
you loaded your film correctly then this
knob should turn every time you advance
the film if it doesn't turn that could
mean that the film isn't being advanced
properly and you should probably try
inserting it again sometimes however it
only doesn't turn at first because of
the way the canisters work so before
advancing you can turn the knob back
until it doesn't let you go further then
when advancing it should turn and if it
doesn't something is not right
now that you've closed the back it is
important to remember that you must not
open this back until you've rolled your
phone back into its canister after
shooting because of course when you open
it light comes in and exposes the film
and ruins it
anyway once you've closed the back you
can advance once more because the film
that is currently behind the shutter has
already been exposed to light so of
course you won't be able to photograph
anything with that once you've moved
once or twice you might get that typical
first shot that is half burnt but after
that all your photographs should be in
full frame
[Music]
so next is of course shooting the film
[Music]
depending on your camera this process is
more or less complicated with an
automatic point shoot there's not much
to think about i mentioned earlier that
you need to set your iso rating which is
what happens now the minolta of course
does this automatically this sylvan
black pattern is called a dx code and
the minolta will read this and
understand that this is an iso 200 film
my olympus on the other hand has this
little setting at the front here where
you tell the camera what iso you've got
in there this is important because the
olympus meters the light automatically
so to meet it correctly it needs to know
which iso the film is the pentax on the
other hand doesn't set your settings
automatically it's fully manual
nevertheless it also has a way to set
the iso this is because the pentax has
an internal light meter which will tell
you if you're currently over or
underexposing or just right and that
light meter of course needs to know what
iso your film is
so when shooting your film manually with
for example an slr you need to get your
settings right just like with the
digital camera when shooting digital
it's often advantageous to slightly
under expose the photograph to retain
the details in the highlights which are
much harder to recover than the details
in the shadows with film it's exactly
the other way around details are hard to
recover from the shadows and easier to
recover from the highlights therefore
when shooting film it's best to expose
correctly or slightly overexpose to know
what settings you need you can use a
light meter the pentax for example has a
built-in light meter however i don't use
it for two reasons
firstly it needs a battery and i don't
really want to go on the search for the
right battery if there's another easy
way to do it
secondly i don't really trust these old
light meters because it's been said that
many of these cameras used their age
have inaccuracies in their light meters
and so i don't really know if the light
meter of my pentax is accurate and so i
just feel safer to use an external light
meter on my phone
there are many different light meter
apps in the app store i use one called
light meter free i tell the light meter
which iso my film is the app i'm
intending to shoot with and then it'll
tell me which shutter speed to use
additionally it gives you a preview of
the exposure so when it says shutter
speed 200 which the pentax doesn't offer
i'll set the camera to 125 to slightly
overexpose instead of underexposed and
so with the light meter working you can
now shoot your first roll of film
[Music]
when you finish the roll of film you'll
notice that you've finished because the
lever will no longer turn so now it's
time to wind the film back into its
canister before getting it out of the
camera to do this each camera usually
has a button to release the film except
the minor it does it automatically of
course but my pentax for example has
this button down here once i press it i
can then use this knob to wind the film
some cameras require that you keep this
button pressed on others you'll only
need to press it once if you're unsure
you can just press it anyway
while turning you'll feel the tension of
the film that you're pulling back at
some point that tension will suddenly
loosen and the turning will be much
easier that means the film is now fully
rolled back into the canister and you
can now open the back of the camera
with your first roll of film now exposed
you can choose to either develop and
scan it yourself or bring it to a lab
and let them do it for you for beginners
i would definitely recommend to just
take it easy and hand it to a lab i
personally don't develop my own film i
just scan it myself however i'm not
going to cover that process in this
video that'll be a separate video one
day when you hand it to a lab they're
going to develop the film for you scan
it edit it and finally send the digital
files to you in my case i hand the film
to the lab and they just develop it and
then call me so that i can come pick up
my negatives which i then scan at home
so that is all i think everything i
would explain to a beginner who wants to
start shooting film i hope this was
helpful if so i'd appreciate a like on
the video consider subscribing if you
haven't yet and i'll see you again next
week in the next video until then
goodbye
[Music]
you

There it is. Can't beat the classics.
Can we just start it already?
He said he'd be right back.
Yeah, but that was like 20 minutes ago. You know he always does this.
We could've played one by now, just kick him!
Alright, we'll do a quick one. Tilted Towers.
No, no, no, wait guys, I'm back. I'm back.
Finally.
What took you so long?
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry about that.
It's okay. Just ready up.
I- I totally will. J- just give me like one more minute.
What?
Are you kidding me?
You know what, just start it.
No no no guys. I swear. I just need one more minute.
I just got to finish something real quick. -Oh my god.
What do you need to do?
Just one - one more second, I swear
Seriously, if we're gonna wait for him one more time I might as well just get off and call it a night and-
Wait wait; shh shh!
What's that sound?
(Clash of Clans sounds are audible in the background)
He's playing Clash.
Oh, my god!
Alright, we're just gonna start.
(From a mic) No guys I'm almost done, I swear!
Everything we've done.
All the sacrifices. The lives lost. The materials.
It all comes down to this.
I know that I may have let you all down in the past.
Well, not this time.
Feels like it's been years since the war began.
Uh, guys?
I can barely remember our days in Shifty Shafts, Greasy Grove, all that time we spent on-
Dude, it's been 7 minutes. We just started.
Yeah. What are you talking about?
We didn't even go to Greasy Grove!
Yeah. Why do you always get so weird when we play this?
That's what separates me from the average player.
What are you doing?
Get down!
This is the kind of mindset you need if you want to make it to the top of the Royale.
Seriously. There's a team out there .
Just crouch!
See, this might seem like some kind of game to you-
Whatever. If he gets knock down, I get his SCAR.
To me, my mind-
What? I have a pistol. You have a rifle.
The best players get the best guns!
Fortnite is a way of li-
Yeah, no, you can't catch bullets in this game.
I know!
Uh... Is someone gonna revive me or... What? We starting over?
Looks like you don't got a gun.
Neither do you.
I guess we both dropped in the wrong house.
I guess we did.
Ahh!
[GASP]
Can you guys see me?
Why would you put that on now?
I dunno. Camouflage?
But we're inside of a house!
Ugh!
See?
[GRUNTING]
Shoot!
Ryan! Boogie Bombs, I got Boogie Bombed!
You've done enough! Ryan, come from the north hole.
Oh! He's coming!
Can we get a shot over here?
Nice shot, nice shot! Come over here now. Revive me!
Damn, you got all of them? Yep. How're you so good at Fortnite, but so bad at PUB-
-Lic restroom cleaning? Yeah, I'm really bad at cleaning those, so...
What? No! I'm talking about why are you so bad at PUB-
-Lishing books? Yeah, I'm no- I'm not a good writer either. So it makes sense.
What? No! I'm talking about PUB-
Can you just stop?
What?
I'm trying to get a sponsorship, alright?
-Oh. So can you please stop shouting out the other one? The V-Bucks don't grow on trees.
Sorry. I just find it weird that you can't even say the name PUB-
Jesus, man!
Where he showed up? on the high ground over there.
(Angelic Choir)
Oh, shoot.
Yeah, we're gonna take some damage. -Yeah, say we keep going. -Well, obviously we have to keep going!
Yeah, I'm just trying to give you some tips, you know. -No, I don't need tips, I-
Well, you-you don't play this game that often so... -What? I've been playing the game more than you!
Almost there.
Yeah.
Oh! We made it!
Finally! I'm super low. You got any heals left?
Nah, you got any ammo you can drop?
No, I don't have anything. We were too busy outrunning the storm.
Damn it!
Alright, iIt looks like there's two left and they're fighting. We should go now.
No no, we got no materials, we're not gonna make it that far.
What? But we have just enough time. We should totally run-
We're wasting time, okay, we gotta do something.
All right. Well, I got one rocket left.
Um... maybe we just shoot the guy behind the tree in the blue field-
Wait wait wait! Unless...
Unless what?
Still got that rocket?
Of course I still got that rocket. What? You thought I shot it while proposing my master plan?
So you still got it then.
Yes!
Alright, you ready?
This is so stupid... we could've made it in by now and you just want to try this dumb thing?
Yeah, pretty much. Let's do it.
Just hurry up already!
Okay, yeah, just shoot it then.
That's what separates me from the average player.
-What are you doing? -Get down!
This is the kind of mindset you need if you wanna make it to the top of the Royale.
See, this might seem like some kind of game to you,
But to me, online,
Fortnite is a way of life.
I did it!
I did it!
Yes!!!
Hey! It's not over yet.
Come on. Look how far he is though. He's not gonna be able to shoot me from there!
And he's not gonna make it into the circle!
-Yeah, there's no way he's gonna make it. -Yeah, he's far!
Fine. But don't go out in the open.
Oh. Don't go out in the open. You mean like this?
Is this in the open or-?
Oh! And do a dance!
Ooh-ouhaha-oh!
Stop!
Nice!
Fine.
How is this guy still alive? You know what?
I'm just gonna grab some bullets and I'm gonna, I'm just gonna shoot him.
Ryan, enough!
You're still super low, remember?
Yeah, maybe uh, maybe hide just a little bit.
You know, for a bunch of dead guy,
You sure have a lot of opinions on how to stay alive.
In reality, I'm the only one who's still-
It's a trap! It's a trap!
I see it. Alright. Look, just because I'm not that good at the game that
you guys play does not mean that I am not good at this game because I-
I really can't believe my victory. I cannot believe you-
Really? Wait, there's only one door here. How'd he leave?
So thank you guys again so much for watching. If you want to see bloopers and behind the scenes click the window on the left.
If you want to see me actually try to play Fortnite for the first time on PC click the one on the right and once again
Thank you so much to Epic Games for allowing us to make this video if you want to download their game for free
I'll put the link in the description.
Wait. We already did that.

[Music]
at the end of the second world war
the cold war had begun the world lay
divided between two great superpowers
the united states and the soviet union
it would not be a conventional war with
the two sides never directly fighting
instead it would be an ideological
battle between communism
and capitalism the east first the west
and the resulting struggle for
ideological influence
and power both sides would stockpile
nuclear weapons
with questions over how to use control
and eliminate them
becoming central to the conflict from
stalin to reagan
from the arms race to the cuban missile
crisis
from the berlin wall to vietnam and
korea
this is the story of the cold war
[Music]
at the end of the second world war
europe lay divided between two camps the
soviet union
the world's leading communist power
would rule over what would become known
as the eastern bloc
after suffering almost 27 million
casualties during the war
soviet leader joseph stalin had been
keen to create a buffer zone against the
west
installing communist governments across
eastern europe
as former british prime minister winston
churchill would famously state
an iron curtain has descended across the
continent
the united states the world's leading
capitalist power
would also emerge as a post-war
superpower
their economy was thriving and they had
sole control of the most powerful weapon
in human history
the atomic bomb two of which president
harry truman had dropped on japan to end
the war
hostilities began when stalin delayed
the removal of soviet troops from iran
and pressured turkey into giving him
control over the turkish straits
wanting to stop soviet expansionism
president truman would announce the
truman doctrine
sending military aid to greece and
turkey
it was a policy aimed at containing the
soviet union
and would become the basis of american
cold war strategy for years to come
this policy was known as containment
fearing the spread of communism in
europe the united states would
also introduce the marshall plan in
april 1948.
it was thought that by improving
europe's economies communism would lose
its appeal
the plan provided almost 13 billion
dollars of financial aid
encouraging economic integration and the
promotion of free markets
germany was one of the most prominent
symbols of the newly divided world
having been split in half after the war
the soviets would occupy the east
with britain france and america
occupying the west
berlin despite laying 100 miles within
the soviet zone
was divided in the same way in june 1948
stalin would begin the berlin blockade
stopping all ground access to the city
in an attempt to drive out the americans
british and french
but truman quickly responded beginning
the berlin airlift
delivering supplies to the city for 15
months and forcing stalin to end at the
blockade
with tensions high the us and its allies
would establish an independent west
german state
the federal republic of germany the
soviets would respond
the following month by creating the
german democratic republic
in the east in response to soviet
expansion and influence
nato the north atlantic treaty
organization
was created in 1949 bringing together
the us
canada and most of western europe in a
defensive pact against the soviet union
to help stop the spread of communism the
cia would be established in september
1947
with the organization growing in size
and strength over the coming years
from 1949 to 1952
cia personnel would increase tenfold
with their overseas bases growing from 7
to 47
and their annual budget increasing from
4.7 million
to 82 million dollars they would go on
to interfere in developing countries
where independence movements were often
seen as potential paths to communism
in 1953 and 54 they would overthrow the
leaders of iran and guatemala
installing highly unpopular dictators in
their place
earning the organization an infamous
reputation
events in east asia would soon turn the
cold war into a global conflict
in china mao zedong had led communist
revolutionaries to victory in 1949
establishing the people's republic of
china
the u.s would respond by increasing
economic support to its new ally japan
in an attempt to stimulate economic
growth in the region
as well as sending aid to french
colonial forces in vietnam
who were fighting against a communist
independence movement
led by ho chi minh in 1950
communist north korea invaded south
korea
with domino theory at the height of
political thought the idea that if one
nation fell to communism
others would as well the united states
sent tens of thousands of american
troops to push the invaders back
north the korean war would drag on for
three years
with the armistice of july 1953 leaving
it so there was no clear victory for
either side
the border between the two careers had
hardly shifted at all
with the loss of life totaling over two
million
but crucially the korean war showed that
communism could be contained
the main thinking behind future
conflicts in particular
vietnam
after stalin's death in 1953 nikita
khrushchev had become leader
soon creating the warsaw pact to counter
the growing power of nato
but khrushchev would soon prove to be a
provocative and unpredictable leader
in november 1956 he would threaten
britain and france with rocket weapons
after they invaded egypt and he was
known for his emotional outbursts
allegedly banging his shoe on a table at
the 1960 united nations general assembly
when a new president john f kennedy came
to power in 1961
khrushchev made an attempt to secure
berlin
there had been around 2.7 million
defections from communist east germany
since 1949 most of which had escaped
through west berlin
securing the city was therefore vital to
the survival of the german democratic
republic
with defections usually of the highly
trained and educated
growing by the day at a 1961 meeting in
vienna
khrushchev gave kennedy six months to
vacate berlin
but kennedy refused now desperate
khrushchev authorized the construction
of the berlin wall
on august 12 1961 creating a physical
barrier between east and west berlin
starting as a barbed wire fence it soon
turned into a massive concrete block
wall
12 feet high and nearly 100 miles long
complete with armed guards and
minefields it was an embarrassment for
communists
everywhere
[Music]
[Music]
but kennedy was having difficulties of
his own cuba had been taken over by
communist revolutionaries in early 1959
led by fidel castro the revolutionaries
began freeing cuba of its economic and
political reliance on the us
eventually turning to the soviet union
for help
not wanting a communist nation so close
to home
kennedy attempted to topple castro from
power in the bay of pigs invasion
using a group of cia-trained cuban
exiles
but it would turn out to be a disaster
with the invaders surrendering
after just three days it was an
embarrassment to kennedy
and convinced khrushchev that he needed
to protect castro
with him sending nuclear missiles to the
island in 1962
american reconnaissance aircraft soon
spotted the missiles
causing kennedy to begin a naval
blockade of cuba to prevent any further
soviet shipments from arriving
a hundred and forty thousand u.s
invasion troops were then stationed in
florida
and the u.s alert system was raised to
defcon 2 for the first time in history
they were preparing for nuclear war
[Music]
as negotiations were underway a
confrontation in the atlantic
almost ended in disaster u.s ships had
used signaling depth
charges to alert a soviet submarine that
it had strayed too close to the blockade
thinking they were under attack the
submarine's captain ordered nuclear
torpedoes to be launched
but the decision required the approval
of all three onboard officers
one of the officers vasily arkipov
refused to go through with the launch
single-handedly preventing the outbreak
of a nuclear war
the very next day on october 28th
kennedy and khrushchev were able to come
to an agreement
kennedy promised not to invade cuba and
khrushchev removed the soviet missiles
it was the closest the world has ever
come to nuclear war
and it significantly impacted the
outlook of both powers
with a hotline being installed between
the white house and the kremlin
to provide better communication if
another crisis occurred
the next major crisis would occur in
vietnam where the u.s had been
supporting the south in their struggle
against the communist north for almost a
decade
after kennedy's assassination in 1963
his vice president
lyndon b johnson was left to deal with
vietnam
believing america would look weak on the
international stage if he allowed the
south to fall to communism
johnson chose to rapidly increase u.s
military involvement
but the war was deeply unpopular and in
1968 protests would break out across the
western world
the largest would be seen in america
where a politicized youth demonstrated
against a war they thought unjust and
unwinnable
the scale of discontent proved too much
for johnson
who decided not to seek re-election the
war would last for another five years
before the us decided to withdraw
with the communist north then taking
over the south
more than 58 000 americans had died as
well as 250 000
south vietnamese soldiers over a million
north vietnamese soldiers and vietcong
gorillas would also perish
as well as over 2 million civilians from
both the north and the south
and thousands more from laos and
cambodia while containment had worked in
korea
it had proven ineffective in vietnam
by 1964 the soviet union had been going
through several
internal difficulties khrushchev had
been deposed and replaced by leonid
brezhnev
whose reign was marked by nepotism
corruption and economic stagnation
standards of living within the soviet
sphere were deteriorating
and disillusionment was growing with the
brezhnev doctrine suppressing dissidents
throughout the region with military
force
this would lead brezhnev to seek a more
stable soviet american relationship
facing large protests over vietnam and
cambodia
president richard nixon was also looking
to stabilize relations
in late 1969 he began talks with
brezhnev about a strategic arms
limitation treaty
or salt which would freeze the existing
number of intercontinental ballistic
missiles on both sides
it was the beginning of a period of
detente a french term that refers to the
easing of tensions between nations
ditant would lead to a tense but
relatively stable decade
during which both sides would attempt to
control their nuclear arsenals and avoid
proxy conflicts
but it would ultimately prove
unsuccessful
when ronald reagan assumed the
presidency in 1981
the conventional wisdom of how to deal
with the soviet union
was falling apart dayton was not working
in 1977 the soviets had placed ss-20
ballistic missiles in eastern europe
and had invaded afghanistan in 1979
fiery speeches would become a trademark
of reagan with him describing the soviet
union as an evil
empire and declaring that democracy will
leave marxism leninism
on the ash heap of history but reagan's
view on nuclear weapons was clear
he wanted to see a world in which they
did not exist and where nations were
free from the threat of total
annihilation
the only way he saw to achieve this was
to force the soviets into a new arms
race they would lose
pressuring them to accept an arms
reduction agreement
as reagan stated their choice is to
break their backs to keep up
or to agree to reductions this policy
would be called peace
through strength the cornerstone of this
policy was the strategic defense
initiative
or sdi nicknamed star wars by the media
the project aimed at creating a radical
new missile defense system
using lasers and space-based missile
systems that could defend against a
nuclear attack
reagan knew that the soviet union was
lagging far behind in computer
technology
and could never hope to match the
programme leaving them dangerously
exposed
this policy worked as predicted with the
soviets soon forced to negotiate
meeting with the us in a 1985 summit to
discuss the ongoing nuclear arms race
[Music]
but this time reagan would meet with a
new soviet leader
mikhail gorbachev who would prove to be
one of the most important figures of the
entire cold war
facing years of economic stagnation and
growing discontent in eastern europe
gorbachev knew things had to change he
would introduce perestroika or
restructuring to reform the economy
and glasnost or transparency to address
corruption and political unrest
he knew that the arms race was crippling
the soviet economy
and that the only way forward was to
negotiate with the united states
gorbachev would meet with reagan on five
separate occasions between 1985
and 1988 with each meeting building
trust and respect between the two
reagan happily negotiated with such an
open and cooperative soviet leader
with the two signing the intermediate
nuclear forces treaty
on december 8 1987 banning all short and
intermediate range missiles
within three years the treaty had led to
the destruction of over two and a half
thousand
nuclear weapons with each side allowing
access to their nuclear sites to check
compliance it was a momentous agreement
being the first time both sides had
pledged to eliminate an entire class of
nuclear missile
but soon gorbachev's reforms would begin
to unravel the soviet union itself
in december 1988 he would make a speech
to the united nations
vowing to cut the soviet ground force
commitment in eastern europe by half a
million men
signaling that the brezhnev doctrine
would no longer be enforced
realizing that they would not be crushed
by the soviet military
reformers began to emerge across eastern
europe and in 1989
a string of democratic revolutions would
see nearly every communist
government ousted from power on november
9th
the most symbolic monument of the cold
war the berlin wall
would come down and germany itself would
be reunited the following year
the soviet union would collapse in 1991
dissolving into 15 independent states a
surprisingly quick
and bloodless conclusion to the cold war
a conflict which had dominated
international relations
for over 40 years
[Music]
you

don't you want this cute this video is
feeding all of my pets little one is
supply first is echo echo the Gecko this
is Cersei just means they buy snakes are
extremely therapeutic if you're feeling
stressed now the cool thing about ball
pythons is there's a lot of different
more why are you naked in one of your
video
I hit a million subscribers which I
never ever thought I'd have that many
the situation terrifies me I don't like
being unliked but it's something I got
to get used to if I'm in the public you
know I'm gonna mess up okay right off
the bat I think this is important
you
hey guys and welcome back to my
abandoned camp if you are a parent and
you're letting your child use the iPad
in the backseat of your car and you hear
me talking out of the iPad right now I
suggest that you change what they're
watching because this video is about
really bad relationships and drug abuse
I probably own around 20 to 25 animals
I'd agree home about 12 of them you
missed you missed you missed the
Crocodile Hunter was like one of my
favorite shows growing up and I just
really loved Steve Irwin and just the
idea of being able to talk about my love
for animals and entertain people at the
same time seemed really cool my name is
Taylor Nicole Dean and I run a YouTube
channel all about how to take care of
exotic animals mainly it's about showing
people that even the creepy crawling
ones that they think might be creepy and
gross or whatever that they're actually
lovable and cute really started to take
off when I had my Hedgehog Nala I
decided to try to make a video to link
to people that told me that they were
getting a hedgehog because of me he
hates everyone
good luck seeing his face after that
original video with Nala just kept going
and now I'm here what as long as hey I
got a peacock feather oh no it's on my
head nobody this was your first
Halloween tiger as a rabbit here's an
early animal picture of me with the
little chick mom always took her to
places where there were animals there's
a little bit older one I made it for a
school picture I was always homebound so
I really go for like pictures and tests
that I couldn't stay at home to do from
fifth grade on didn't really attend
school they didn't know what was wrong
with me and at first I had a lot of
chronic illness that was undiagnosed and
they figured out I had a ehlers-danlos
syndrome ehlers-danlos syndrome is a
connective tissue disorder which
basically means I can dislocate my body
very easily I can hurt my body I can
get myself hurt on one time I woke up
and thought I had it cold so I went to
the doctor and they found out I had
shattered my clavicle in my sleep it's
hard to socialize you make plans and
want to go and then not feel good we're
not going off and just miss a lot of
things I guess I got in this weird funk
for a while where I felt like talking
about my illnesses on here too much
would just get me viewed as like the
sick girl or something and that people
really wouldn't want to be friends with
me I'm really really really outgoing I
really really love meeting people but
I'm also overwhelmingly anxious about
the whole experience and kind of suck at
making friends sometimes I don't know
what kind of occupation or job you know
would lend itself to someone with you
know chronic fatigue and pain issues and
it's sort of the perfect the perfect fit
I never heard of pet - when I started
doing YouTube videos I just started
talking about my animals and discovered
that there's a whole entire niche on
YouTube that is just all about exotic
animals my little girl right here she's
still big enough or small enough to hold
her welcome back to my youtube channel
I'm joined here with Sasha
this is Janet our bull snake he was my
very first snake and he is just a
sweetheart I really thought YouTube was
gonna be a hobby always I thought maybe
would bring in an extra hundred bucks or
something at the most a few months into
starting I got a paycheck that was equal
to the amount I made at Petco and I was
just like what is the risk and quitting
and just trying YouTube and seeing what
happens I have quit my day job and
literally my full-time job what I make
up all my money off of is going to be
caring for my animal I signed with the
manager and when he started helping out
with like sponsorships and merch and
stuff like that I started to see like
how big of a thing this could actually
be I hit 100,000 subscribers my
back-to-school supplies are available
now there's a really good chance that by
the time I upload this I'll be at
500,000 subscribers which is crazy when
it comes to making your first purchase
you can use Taylor for 10% off I hit
million subscribers which I never ever
thought I'd have that many I have about
1.8 million subscribers on YouTube the
reach my boy Scott was definitely
something I wasn't used to so it was
really weird to suddenly have the
attention shift onto me like that
definitely one particular thing that the
people that dislike me talk about is my
animal care yeah the people that dislike
me are very very extreme sometimes
there's no reasoning with them whenever
you talk to them they always find a
worse reason and if they don't find a
reason to continue the argument they
completely flip it on a completely
unrelated subject just to keep digging
and there's literally no way for me to
prove that I handled my animals when I'm
not online because the only way these
people know me is online so they don't
they don't know what I'm doing when I'm
off-camera I think that just comes from
this crazy expectation that anyone that
goes online and gets this amount of
attention needs to be doing everything
perfectly normal things can't happen
that what happened to anyone
it was really crappy for me to do
because it showed children that they
could just go buy an animal and figure
it out and I don't want that to be my
message on here so again I really
apologize for that situation what's
important is I learned from it and I'm
not gonna do it again it's been weird
growing up online because then I've had
to make all the mistakes that I do make
publicly instead of it just being a
little slip-up in my personal life it's
a slip-up that two million people know
about so something I struggle every day
learning how to deal with this video is
going to be talking about addiction I
personally did not understand addiction
either up until about two months ago I
think I've always seen in my life that
I've had addictive tendencies growing up
and I always would say that kind of like
its personality trait alcohol and
drinking I wasn't really exposed to that
much growing up and I never went to
dances and in school or parties in high
school or anything
my very first party I ever attended was
because of YouTube when I started my
youtube channel it took off so fast and
I just wanted to be accepted always been
a problem with me is that I wanted to
always be accepted someone offered me a
tiny tiny tiny bump of cocaine and
everyone was doing it and acting
so I was like okay whatever I'll try it
and the next day I was just obsessing
about it and my brain just was like you
need it again you need it again and I
was extremely depressed for weeks being
completely isolated and wanting to be
accepted craving that codependent
relationship I was pretty much ready to
jump on to anyone who looked at me even
basically I meet this guy online
was a huge fan of his music he is 10
years older than me and someone who
deals with addiction and he had a lot
more access to all of these things he
was able to get me the connections I
never could have gotten back in Texas
his issue was opiates and he started
bringing them around and I just decided
oh well I'll try what he has it'll be a
different feeling but I'll try it and
after that I just never went back to
coke I just started dabbling with
opiates and I just kept telling myself
that it's not a problem it's a
prescription drug it can't be that
horrible it was just me trying to
rationalize what was happening this is
when my channel really really really
took a dive and I'm finally able to say
that it was my relationship that I got
into he was gone all day and I didn't
know why and he came home later that day
and told me he was gonna take a bath and
I noticed that he brought ice cream into
the bath and he was just being really
weird not making sense I decided I
wanted ice cream I go over to the sink
and I noticed he only put the bowl of
ice cream in there not the spoon
everything just sank in me I want to try
to confront him and the bathroom is
blocked he finally gets up and lets me
in and he's like I don't know what you
want and instead of staying in the
bathroom he walks out and goes and hides
in a corner and I started digging
through everything and I find the spoon
and the drawer and I'm like why is the
spoon in the drawer he goes I don't know
what you're talking about I don't want
you mean that's not you know not my
spoon I don't know
he's acting all weird and I turn it over
and it's burnt and I just start sobbing
and screaming I said you need to go to
rehab you need to get help
Lia's please please flush this needle
with me and let's end this once and for
all let's get you help
I'll stay with you I'll support you I'll
pay for the rehab let's just get you
better but instead he goes I really
think that we should finish what I have
left of the heroin together and then get
clean we'll have the best high that
you've ever had and we'll have it
together and it'll be beautiful and I'll
hold you and we'll watch a movie and
we'll be in complete peace and then
we'll never do this again and we will
get clean and sober and we put all the
drugs in our pasts and I'll go to rehab
and I will get help but let's just have
one more good night that was my first
time using heroin I started with like
the most baby dose ever and I worked all
the way up to this heroin that was cut
with fit and all it was the most
miserable experience of my life but I
just kept trying to think it's not as
bad as it could be like I'm still in a
really nice house I'm still have my job
I still have this and that when in
reality I like hadn't made a video in
like six months I was you know losing
all contacts to everyone and all I had
was this dude that just kept shooting me
up
[Music]
it all happened so fast I kept thinking
I was in control and then suddenly I
wasn't I don't know if you guys can hear
that but that's myself flushing toilet
so that's the video and I really hope
you guys enjoyed it and again thank you
so much for sticking around and waiting
to even watch this I couldn't imagine
staying interested in my channel after
it being dead for so long people kind of
knew what was going on it got to a point
where even as careful as I could be in
like little you Instagram stories and
stuff you could see sometimes needles
and people were zooming in on things and
finding things light of recent news
about Nicole Taylor Dean it's time to
talk about addictions farmers
allegations go neither my boyfriend or
myself are doing drugs it isn't possible
to fully care for that many animals
while you're abusing substances right
she needs to go to rehab I feel like
some of her pets you do need to be
rehomed so my plan was I was gonna take
a medicine that stopped all the way draw
symptoms and I was gonna be fine but I
was super sick I was sick for like 14
hours I couldn't answer the phone I
couldn't get out of bed I passed out a
few times on the floor it was my mom
found me and I could not lie and she
brought me to rehab that day and I got
sober I honestly expected to lose like a
hundred thousand subscribers so it's
like was my estimate my head I know when
I posted it I lost a thousand and that
was it and then I ended up gaining a lot
more and not that that is what matters
from it but I was just really amazed
that there was that many people so
supportive about it one of the comments
that really stood out to me was some
girl said that she watched the whole
video and it reminded her of her
situation with her fiance she said like
that she packed her bags and left him
that night
so that was cool
I was expecting such a bad response and
I was going to be okay with that and
just to seem like anyone say like hey
I've I think I've been being abused for
seven years now and just gave me the
strength delete you fridges I don't know
the fun stuff I do online and stuff us I
love it I love connecting with people
and entertaining people but when I have
these emotional connections with people
it's just crazy I don't know what my
channel is now like I know it's
definitely still gonna be my animals and
all of that but I have this whole new
part of it hopefully I will get there
I'm not still not the best at my hygiene
yet still in that phase of getting my
life back on track
deep down I kind of always thought you
know they're there for the cute animals
and that's it so it's just kind of weird
now to have this whole part that's
really just about my own experience and
my own life and actually me yeah you
know I'm living at home with my parents
right now and spend most of my time
doing therapy and remembering to shower
and eat and stuff and it's just normal
either way hopefully this whole series
can help some people that are either
struggling or know someone that's
struggling or just wants to learn about
addiction in general because another
really big part in sobriety is the idea
that if you give back to others it makes
you more capable to stay sober by
helping others so now I just really want
to help as much as I can that's that's
all I want to keep doing I don't know
where I'm uploading it if I just upload
it on you know like YouTube you could
ask in the comment section like hey why
is my Hedgehog do this I don't know in
these um thanks
[Music]
[Applause]

CREATIVELY.
WE DON'T HAVE TO BE A MUSICIAN 
WHO'S WINNING AWARDS OR A 
BEST-SELLING WRITER OR PAINTER 
TO BE CREATIVE AND MOVE THROUGH 
LIFE IN THIS WAY.
>> AND SULEIKA, YOU ADVOCATE FOR
BONE MARROW DONATION.
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

JOINTHESYMPHONY.ORG AND OUR 
MISSION IS TO MAKE THE BONE 
MARROW REGISTRY LOOK LIK

West Yorkshire has the highest burglary
rate in the country and there's a
particular type of break-in that started
here in Bradford that's on the increase
as I've been finding out there's a lock
that's fitted to millions of homes up
and down the country that can be broken
in seconds my one wish would be to get
rid of all these cylinders and the very
weak still sell them in DIY stars they
said the laptops have gone the mo bars
have gone everything's gone the Xbox has
gone everything that was down here that
was sellable believe it or not it will
only take two minutes 30 seconds to go
through a whole house this is what's
called a euro Profile lock and they're
fitted to millions of homes across the
country usually in uPVC doors now the
problem is that some burglars have
discovered how easy it is to break them
and then walk in through your front door
locks snapping first started in the
Bradford area and now more than a
quarter of all burglaries in West
Yorkshire use this method
Peter Findlay is a career burglar who's
recently been released from prison he
says he's now going straight but reckons
he's burgled literally thousands of
homes so what does he make of the Euro
cylinder locks if I add the best block
picks in England don't bother using them
just snap lock it's more simpler quicker
and it's a problem that's growing since
2009 the figures for this type of
burglary have risen steadily in West
Yorkshire so what can be done about it
if you're not sure about the standard
and quality of your locks contact your
local crime reduction officer who will
provide advice free of charge and think
about getting in touch with one of the
not-for-profit organisations of which
there are a number in West Yorkshire
alone the Association of Chief police
officers are working with the door and
lock industry to come up with a new
British standard for locks but at the
moment there are no locks on the market
which come up to the new standard
the locks are vulnerable to to this to
the specific type of attack but it can
take anything between 50 seconds and and
2 minutes to to force the lock what we'd
want to do is ensure that the new
british standard locks are a lot
stronger than that and can resist attack
I wouldn't want to put specific time
frame on it but certainly the testing is
extensive and the new locks are now in
the process of being tested
so between 50 seconds and 2 minutes
we've been told that many of these locks
can be broken a lot quicker than that
time to find out to demonstrate just how
easy it is to break into one of these
locks we've brought in a form of burglar
who's now a security expert and he's
going to show us how it's done and we're
going to time him the member of the
public has allowed us to test the theory
on their front door okay the doors
locked so Michael you're happy with what
you're doing yeah now we can't obviously
show exactly how you break in but ready
when you are
okay I'm really okay
you
Michael that was 42 seconds that was
slow was it very slow only a bit rusty
that but how easy is that to get in
really to be honest with you our very
very surprised that easy it was because
that broke off the cylinder so easy and
all out to do then is actually type of
mechanism out and I mean that really
shows just how easy it is is get in it's
amazing absolutely amazing when you look
at the security on the the actual
locking and yet you can get through that
cylinder so easy totally amazed 42
seconds and to be fair this isn't
something you're doing every day either
isn't so someone who knows what they're
doing I mean who knows how fast that
could have been I reckon you could cut
that down to 15 seconds really it's
quite worried on his Nettie's big worry
we've arranged for security company
kasich to fix the householders broken
lock the managing director Neil is not
at all surprised at how quickly Michael
was able to get in it's breezy to his
first time Michaels actually attempted
to do that and as I said it was very
very shocked we see it doing Dale so if
you took this kind of lock out of
circulation would that go a long way to
helping yes that my one wish would be to
get rid of all these delivers but that's
easier said than done although many
councils and housing associations have
locked replacement programs there are
still hundreds of thousands of these
euro cylinder locks on homes across
Yorkshire
Woodhouse in Leeds and this is an
increasingly familiar site for scenes of
crime officers across West Yorkshire
it's about three o'clock this morning
and I woke up because I heard a loud
bang and so I went to wake up my
boyfriend he got up and went downstairs
we had to look outside the window but we
couldn't see anyone around and so we
went back to bed and didn't think much
more of it when we got up this morning
to go to work we open the front door and
we found that the outside of the front
door lock had actually been sort of
prized open a sort of jimmied open and
Rebecca is by no means alone locksmiths
working for this security firm reckon
they've been called out almost every day
two break-ins where the lock has been
snapped the policeman came around this
morning had look at the lock he
explained that really it's thought it
was a more old-fashioned type of lock
and he was the one who recommended that
we actually had the new style of lock
first in only a couple of days after
Rebecca Khan was burgled Kasich are busy
attending another lock snapping burglary
this time in the Farley area of Leeds I
didn't realize the extent of it until my
husband came down behind me he said the
laptops have gone the mobiles have gone
everything's gone the Xbox has gone
everything that was down here that was
sellable Christine had thought her locks
were secure but she certainly doesn't
know I was advised this morning that if
I took it through my insurance company
they would probably do like for like and
I wasn't happy at the thought of that
because I wouldn't feel safe in this
house if they put the same kind of locks
back on so I just made some inquiries
and the police advised man that's why
we've got these in
with so many locks on the market it can
be confusing so if you're not sure about
how good your locks are the best advice
is to talk to your local crime reduction
officer

good evening uh loose' you're in good
evening
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
good
simple poster nice and big it's actually
a bargain at $19.99 expensive yes mm-hmm

country India to celebrate the wedding
together with his family in the southern
state of Kerala
I'm the first of my family to study
abroad and work abroad as well and I'm
first of my family to marry a woman from
outside Kerala it's not that normal in
India working in Europe and taking a
bride in faraway Kerala are big steps
for pettish
[Music]
when pratishta rived in germany he
shared an apartment in stuttgart his
former roommates are looking forward to
the wedding and to getting to know his
family to his wedding will probably
serve as best man and bridesmaid also
I've got to have a word of this father
because party has been trying to get his
permission to marry for two years now
and his father is just 2 or 3 years
younger than I am so as the elder one I
have to take the initiative and say how
it's going to be especially since we're
like foster parents to party she org
even taught party Sh how to cook German
food Spacely for instance I can't say
I've assimilated into German society in
just six years
all my life I've eaten Indian cuisine
and I can't change completely in just
six years other aspects of the German
lifestyle have been far more appealing
that's something that's really good here
in Germany a pleasant evening in this
part of Germany involves vegetarian
spaetzle and good friends party Sh fits
right in
yeah the people here would say it's
edible in his six years in Germany
Kurdish has gone all but native that is
except when it comes to such a
fundamental life event as a wedding that
has to happen in India his old friends
Georg and Hilde would have arrived from
Germany Pradesh helps them pick out
clothes appropriate to the big occasion
with his expert advice they go shopping
at the best department store in Harry
pot pratices hometown I wouldn't buy
anything else it suits you now it's
Georg Stern I'd rather try something in

a friends just like a normal Indian ones
nice I'd like that one myself
I look like a sheikh great I'll take
this one I can't stop laughing
dressed like a genuine Indian Georg

they have a little time to enjoy the
Indian Ocean before the celebration
begins unlike Western custom the bridal
couple don't have to avoid meeting
before the wedding I'm allowed to see
her now I have permission amigo the
bride and her family are from northern
India this is my father and then comes
another surprise I can speak a little
German I learned it at the Goethe
Institute

about 3,000 kilometers away right delis
in northern India and Kerala's in
southern India I'm very excited the
evening before the wedding the women
celebrate with lots of music and dance
[Music]
for Anu it's a marriage of love she met
her future husband Pratyush on the
internet he was in Stuttgart and she was
in Delhi she had to obtain her parent's
permission it took her two years to do
so neither set of parents will end up
seeing much of their children have to
live in Germany I like it there I've
seen the winter I was in Germany once in
January when it snowed and once in
summer and tomorrow I have no idea what
to expect

Hildred uses the time to have a good
look around the kitchen

[Applause]
[Music]
the cook proudly shows the guests
everything the crew have been cooking
around the clock for two days using
various blends of many spices I can't
imagine how prestige could eat German
food when he's used to this but he never
let on and it seemed strange to him in
fact he always ate everything he did say
again to practice a bit to be able to
handle German food I say so given our
meat and potatoes diet 500 guests are
expected they start trickling in at last
the celebrations can begin
[Music]
following long-established rituals the
bride and groom approached the Brahmin
the priest
[Music]
[Music]
a new who pays homage to her future
mother-in-law
her own mother takes leave of her and
practice takes her as his wife
[Music]
[Music]
some of the rituals are unknown to Anu
[Music]
but exchanging rings has a symbolic
meaning that everyone understands
[Music]
[Applause]
just as obligatory are the wedding
photos including the German friends who
traveled so far to be here
[Music]
as soon as the ceremony's over the
moment comes that everyone's been
waiting for it's time to chow down in
this region the wedding feast is made up
of 23 different small portions served on
banana leaves
the only ones who have to wait are the
bridal couple reams of photos are taken
Hilde would and Georg take a moment for
themselves we're kind of exhausted and
overwhelmed by all the variety
confronting us here we really don't
understand much in which we couldn't
even figure out what it was supposed to
be about the reception continues into
the evening for the close friends and
relatives
brought Tisha's father looks after the
German friends meanwhile the groom gives
his impression of how things went it was
stressful yes but it all went smoothly
though it was a bit much with all the
photographers they wore us out they
stayed here till around 5 o'clock
I changed saris three times today is my
fourth Pradesh's mother misses him
already my mother says that since I've
been away she doesn't look at the stars
in the sky anymore because they remind
her that I'm so far away she's very sad
that I'm in such a far off place
the celebration still has a long way to
go three days later it continues at the
bride's home in Delhi it wouldn't have
been easy to get married in Germany it's
all very different when you do it in
India
[Music]
[Applause]
poor bride and groom it was a
celebration that will stay with them
long after they've moved to Germany

You're watching FreeSchool!
Hundreds, even thousands, of years ago, before
Europeans came to explore and conquer, the
Maya ruled in Mesoamerica.
One of the most powerful civilizations ever
to exist in what is now Central America, the
Maya created huge stone temples and pyramids,
elaborate artwork, and a complex system of
heiroglyphics that puzzled academics for centuries.
Despite these achievements, the Maya never
unified and formed an empire under a single
leader: instead, many small city-states, each
ruled by its own king, shared a common culture
to make up the Maya civilization.
The Maya people worshiped nature gods - gods
of the sun, the moon, rain, and corn.
According to the Popol Vuh, a book that contains
the legends of the Maya, the gods began by
creating the earth and the sky.
Next they made the animals, the birds and
the flying creatures.
There was just one problem: the animals could
not speak to worship the gods.
So, the gods decided to make humans.
The first humans were made out of mud, but
they crumbled back into dirt.
The gods tried a second time, carving humans
out of wood.
The wooden people were strong, but they did
not worship the gods, and so the gods destroyed
them with a flood.
Finally the gods tried a third time, and made
humans out of white and yellow corn.
The precious corn was the material that finally
produced real humans who would worship the
gods.
The Maya civilization developed in the thick
jungles of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, spreading
into what is now Guatemala, Belize, western
Honduras, and El Salvador.
Four thousand years ago, around 2000 BC, the
Maya began to farm, cultivating corn, beans,
squash, and chili peppers.
They would have hunted deer, turkeys, rabbits,
monkeys, and iguana.
The Maya were also one of the first people
learn to use cocoa beans.
The cocoa beans were made into a paste and
mixed with water, cornmeal, honey, and chile
peppers to make a spicy, frothy drink for
the Maya kings and priests.
Cocoa beans were so valuable that they were
often used as a form of money.
Over time, these farms developed into permanent
settlements - towns, and villages.
By 750 BC these towns developed into bigger,
more sophisticated cities.
Some of their cities may have been home to
more than 100,000 people.
Most people lived in huts made out of poles and
vines and plastered with mud, but the ruling
class lived in huge stone palaces.
Maya cities were the center of their culture.
As their cities grew, the Maya built elaborate
stepped stone pyramids, paved roads and raised
causeways, wide plazas with tall stone monuments,
and altars for religious sacrifices.
Another common feature of Maya cities were
large stone courts that could be used to play
a sport known simply as 'the ballgame.'
The Maya ballgame was central to their culture
and their cities, and was a symbol of their
wealth and power.
The stone courts had high sides where people
could sit and watch as two teams competed
for control of a heavy ball made of rubber.
Players were not allowed to move the ball
with their hands or feet, instead hitting
it with their hips, elbows, and knees to keep
it in the air.
The players tried to get the ball through
a small stone hoop, high up on a wall of the
court.
Getting the ball through the hoop ended the
game, but it was so difficult to do that the
games could go on for weeks.
The ballgame was more than just a sport.
It symbolized a battle between the Maya gods
in the heavens, and the rulers of Xibalba,
the underworld.
The winning team would represent the Hero
Twins of Maya legend, and the losers were
sometimes sacrificed to the gods.
Sacrifice was important in Maya culture.
An offering of blood was seen as food or nourishment
for the gods.
Sometimes the Maya would cut themselves and
offer their blood to the gods.
Other times they would sacrifice animals.
Human sacrifice was usually limited to important
events, like the dedication of a new temple
or a new king, or times of trouble, like famine,
drought, or war.
War was frequent in the lands of the Maya.
They were not unified under a single ruler.
Instead, each city and its surrounding land
was ruled by its own king, or 'holy lord,'
who claimed to be related to the gods and
communicate with them for their people.
These small kings fought each other for resources,
for territory, and for power.
It was common for warriors to make small raids
into their neighbor's territory, taking captives
and looting their riches.
Prisoners were sometimes tortured and forced
to play the ballgame, after which they would
be sacrificed.
Sometimes larger battles resulted in a strong
city conquering or destroying a weaker one.
The Maya were proud of their battles.
Warrior kings had their victories recorded
on stone monuments, which endure to this day.
Between the frequent warring and human sacrifice,
you might think that the Maya were a violent
and warlike people, but they were also scholars
and astronomers, who made many advances in
mathematics, writing, and art.
The Maya developed a complete system of numbers
based on the number 20, nearly 1,000 years
before the development of the Arabic number
system that we use today.
They also discovered the concept of zero,
one of only a few cultures in history to invent
it independently.
They used their number system to create one
of the most accurate calendar systems ever
made, one which would not be rivaled for a
thousand years.
They made great advancements in astronomy,
observing the skies as closely as possible
without a telescope.
With these, they were able to track the motions
of the sun, the moon, and the planets very
accurately, and correctly predict their motions
even thousands of years in the future.
Around 300 BC, the Maya began to write.
It was the only true writing system ever to
be developed in the Americas.
Instead of 26 letters, like the English alphabet,
the Maya used more than 800 different heiroglyphs.
Some of the heiroglyphs represented words,
while others represented syllables that could
be combined to spell out words and write sentences.
The Maya made paper books from the inner bark
of trees that folded up like an accordian.
A book of this kind is called a codex.
In the 16th century, all but a handful of
the Maya codices were burned by Spanish priests
and conquistadors.
Fortunately, the Maya left written records
many other places, carved in stone in temples,
sculptures, and on monuments, which lets us
piece together some of their history.
The Maya have been called by some the greatest
artists in Mesoamerica.
Although they had no metal tools, they were
expert carvers, creating elaborate objects
out of bone, flint, and jade.
They carved the stone of their buildings - the
walls, the doorways, and the stairs.
They carved their sacrificial altars and the
markers of the ball courts.
Most of all, they carved monuments to their
kings and their warriors, recording victories
and important events for their history.
The Maya were also skilled in ceramics, making
pottery of many different shapes and sizes.
Cups, bowls, plates, and vases were often
elaborately decorated with paintings or carvings,
sometimes even with heiroglyphic writing.
The Maya also made detailed and realistic
figurines in the shape of people and animals.
Although few examples survived the tropical
climate of the Maya homeland, they also made
beautiful paintings and murals.
Some of the brightest and most vivid murals
remaining used a special color called Maya
blue.
This bright blue color was very strong, and did
not fade as cities were overtaken by jungle.
After the fall of Maya civilization, the secret
to making this color was lost, puzzling chemists
and artists alike for hundreds of years.
At the height of their culture, Maya population
may have topped 5 million people, but around
900 AD, their civilization began to decline.
It did not fall all at once - because it was
never an empire with a centralized government,
the fall was slow and gradual.
One by one, cities fell into chaos and were
abandoned to be reclaimed by the jungle, but
no one is really sure why.
Perhaps the population grew too large for
the land to produce enough food for everyone
to eat.
Maybe constant wars between city-states destroyed
trade routes and alliances.
Even a long drought could have caused people
to abandon their cities.
By the time the Spanish arrived in the 1500s,
most Maya were living in small farming villages,
their ancient stone cities forgotten and lost
beneath a layer of living jungle.
A few cities were still inhabited, but they
were not used ceremonially the way they had
been centuries earlier.
The Maya were one of the most enduring and
longest-lasting civilizations in the history
of the world.
Many people have wondered, where did they
go?
The truth is, the Maya are not gone.
Millions of Maya still live in their ancestral
homeland in the Yucatan, speaking Mayan languages
and practicing the traditions of their people.
As for the ancient Maya, we are still learning
about them.
Many Maya structures are hidden in the jungles
of the Yucatan, overgrown and just waiting
for explorers and archaeologists to find them.
Pyramids and cities, as well as the artifacts
and treasures inside them, are constantly
being discovered.
As they are, we add more pieces to the puzzle
and improve our understanding of the Maya,
the ancient builders of Mesoamerica.
I hope you enjoyed learning about the Maya
today.
Goodbye till next time!

hello everyone and welcome back to the
fluctus channel
military Pilots are not born but made
the reason I wanted to become a pilot as
corny as it may be was I watched Top Gun
when I was five years old and we were
saying yep that's what I want to do
and preparing the average recruit to fly
some of the most advanced aircraft in
the world is no simple process
recruiting Air Force pilots is a lengthy
detailed process that can vary depending
upon a specific program and requirements
those who apply must meet a battery of
requirements even before they take the
Air Force officer qualifying test or
afoqt
if they pass they will enter the officer
training school or Air Force Academy
foreign
[Music]
all of this happens before they even
apply for pilot training
[Music]
a highly specialized process that can
take several years to complete
[Music]
since aspiring Air Force pilots do not
necessarily have practical flight
knowledge they need to learn theory in a
classroom before they touch a plane a
little knob on the right and that's
where you guys are going to set the
altimeter setting really important that
you guys understand what altitude are
actually at they're both we're looking
both the U.S Air Force has embraced
numerous classroom Concepts over the
years
but the ptn or Pilot training next
program is one of the newest and most
advanced
[Music]
launched in 2018 ptn is intended to
enhance and accelerate the training of
new pilots
I leveraging advancements in virtual
reality augmented reality artificial
intelligence and other Cutting Edge
Technologies
foreign
hopes to mitigate some of the challenges
traditional pilot training programs face
such as the high cost limited
availability of training aircraft and of
course long education times
with its Advanced VR powered simulators
the ptn can provide realistic and
immersive training experiences that
enhance comprehension while reducing the
need for actual flight hours
Flight Training Air Force pilots will
generally move on to Advanced Training
which focuses on specific types of
aircraft ISS Solo in the back
they can also join programs or
initiatives set to train them on new
aircraft like the F-35 lightning II
foreign
[Music]
Pilots are required to put in a certain
number of flight hours to become
certified on an aircraft
they still spend the majority of their
time in the classroom
[Music]
flight is a science after all and these
new pilots not only need to understand
the physics of their job but also boast
an extensive knowledge of the aircraft
they are flying
um
student Pilots will almost always
complete their first flight in a new
aircraft with an instructor
[Applause]
however in the case of one-seater
aircraft like the F-35 pilots and
instructors will generally go up in
separate aircraft during the First
Flight Training
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
B core students conducted their first
training sortie over Luke Air Force Base
in Arizona
[Applause]
while exciting for everyone concerned
it's important to note that these Pilots
have studied Theory and engaged with
simulators for weeks or months
beforehand
this affords them a lot of confidence
when flying the real thing for the first
time
[Music]
Pilots are trained to use various skills
tactics and strategies to engage and
defeat enemy aircraft at close range
[Music]
when the goal is to operate combat
aircraft in offensive and defensive
scenarios Pilots will need to undergo
extensive in-flight weapons and tactics
training on top of basic Flight Training
[Music]
of the most important of these is
dogfight training
[Music]
the term dogfight refers to Aerial
combat in which two or more aircraft are
engaged
[Music]
during dogfight training Pilots will
learn to execute basic and advanced
combat maneuvers
learn about spatial awareness and energy
management and work with countermeasures
such as chaff flares and electronic
interference
most modern Fighters are designed for
multi-purpose Mission capabilities
this means they will not only engage
enemy aircraft
but also provide much needed support by
attacking enemy positions on the ground
this can be accomplished with a number
of techniques including bomb dropping
firing Rockets or missiles
or executing what's known as a strafing
run
this is where the aircraft flies low and
fast over a Target while firing weapons
such as machine guns or cannons
given the generally large caliber of
modern aircraft guns these attacks can
be devastating for troops on the ground
[Music]
while somewhat routine another maneuver
that requires extensive training is
simple aerial refueling
[Music]
this is where Fighters or other aircraft
engage with a tanker plane in mid-air so
that they can refuel without having to
land
[Music]
during aerial refueling the tanker
aircraft extends a refueling boom or
probe and drobe system
the receiving aircraft then matches the
speed connects to the apparatus and
receives the required amount of fuel
foreign
this operation involves some risks
mainly due to its sheer complexity
however most of these are based on human
errors technical malfunctions or adverse
weather conditions
[Music]
with the proper training and practice
aerial refueling is exceptionally safe
[Music]
easily the most significant change in
military Flight Training has been the
invention of virtual reality and the
Advent of the advanced flight simulator
[Music]
for instance rather than showing a
series of pixels and shapes newer VR
simulators can replicate realistic
virtual environments that closely
replicate real world scenarios
[Music]
these Technologies can also recreate
various weather conditions terrain
features and even complex combat
situations allowing Pilots to practice
in a safe yet immersive environment
foreign
[Music]
flight simulators and VR training also
allow militaries worldwide to mitigate
both risk and costs
trainees can practice emergency
procedures flight Maneuvers and tactical
operations without the potential of
danger of accidents equipment damage or
injury
[Music]
there is no need for actual aircraft
there is no costly fuel consumption or
ground crew hours to consider it's
important to note that simulators cannot
wholly replace actual flying
such technologies will likely always be
used in conjunction with live training
exercises you're empty too
Pilots not only need to prepare their
minds to fly aircraft but their bodies
as well
foreign
[Music]
humans are subjected to extreme forces
that can sometimes result in unforeseen
medical reactions
[Music]
one of the oldest and most reliable ways
to prepare pilots and Navigators for
flight is to use a centrifuge
centrifuges are used to simulate High
gravitational forces commonly known as
g-forces
yeah they had the groundbreaking
ceremony there
over the years repeated exposure to high
g-forces have been shown to cause loss
of consciousness when not adequately
managed
therefore the primary objective of
centrifuge training is to expose Pilots
to high g-forces in a safe controllable
environment
this helps them understand the
sensations and develop techniques to
mitigate the associated physiological
effects
another inescapable fact of flight is
exposure to high altitudes as Pilots
climb higher they enter a space where
the air has much less oxygen
[Music]
hypoxia training Chambers also known as
altitude Chambers are specialized
facilities where such training is
performed
[Music]
Chambers are designed to simulate high
altitude conditions by reducing the
atmospheric pressure and related oxygen
content
[Music]
hypoxia training Chambers can simulate
altitudes of up to 25 000 feet or higher
in many cases the Air Force will
actually Force the trainees to
experience full hypoxia or low blood
oxygen so that they can be more familiar
with its effects
play doctor okay
oh your arms up as a tea
and that same quick is the breaststroke
perhaps one of the most extreme and
grueling tests trainee Pilots will be
subjected to is water survival training
can be performed in specialized pools or
in the open water
[Music]
either way the goal is to accurately
simulate all the things that might
happen in the event of a water
evacuation
for instance jet skis will drag Pilots
to simulate being pulled around in the
Water by an open parachute
it will also be asked to swim in Flight
suits while carrying Survival equipment
while this sort of training may seem
excessive it goes to show just how
committed the Air Force is to Preparing
their pilots for anything they might
encounter

1783 and the Americans have left the
Empire led by King George the third
famous for being crazy now had to find a
new place for a penal colony and it
found one in Australia so both Australia
and New Zealand had been known to
Europeans for centuries because of past
Dutch explorers it was Captain James
Cook who sailed to both and claim them
for Britain New South Wales was chosen
as Britain's new penal colony in the
first convicts arrived in 1788
so in the next year the French
Revolution happened paving the way for
the Napoleonic Wars which were a British
victory victory here gave Britain a few
new colonies such as Malta and South
Africa importantly it also weakened
Britain's great imperial rival meaning
it could increase the size of his empire
without much resistance which it did the
century following the Napoleonic Wars is
known as the Pax Britannica
the British Peace in which Britain was
the world's sole superpower over the
next few decades Britain which Islands
had formally been incorporated into
seized Guiana Singapore Assam and this
territory in India Britain was helped in
these ventures by the East India Company
who oversaw Britain Strait with China
mostly in opium China had previously
banned opium but Britain refused to
listen and kept importing it anyway
because money in 1839 the Imperial
Chinese government seized opium from
British ships and destroyed it which led
to armed conflict which Britain won
gaining lots of money a continuation of
opium selling in Hong Kong Britain's
victory here also gave it huge influence
over China's economy bringing it into
what is known as the informal Empire the
informal Empire consisted of places
which weren't directly under British
control but due to military and
diplomatic pressure were often coerced
into acting in Britain's interests to
the northwest of India Britain turned
its eyes to Afghanistan on the surface
this was for trade but the major reason
was Russia Britain was afraid that
Russia would seize either Afghanistan or
Persia from which he could then invade
India Britain was also worried that
Afghanistan would make an alliance with
Russia and so invaded this was a
complete disaster and amounted to
nothing more than a slaughter of British
and Indian troops by the Afghan militias
this competition for influence between
Britain and Russia is known as the great
game and spread beyond Asia and into
Europe the Russians were increasing
their influence in the Balkans and
Britain was worried about Russian
dominance there as well in order to curb
Russia Britain France and the Ottoman
Empire began the Crimean War which was a
victory for the Allies and slowed the
growing Russian power in North America
Canada was established as a province and
the borders between itself and the US
were finalized
Canada later gained autonomy by becoming
a Dominion which meant that the colony
was self-governing but foreign policy
was left to Britain also about this time
the British began to settle New Zealand
at first the Maori the natives of New
Zealand were fine with Europeans as they
brought trated them but eventually it
dawned on them that the Europeans
weren't going to stop coming this led to
war which the British won leading to
more European settlement in contrast to
populating New Zealand Ireland faced one
of the greatest D populations in human
history thanks to the potato famine
which decimated potato harvests the
British forced the Irish to grow cash
crops which meant that there was less
space to grow food there the Irish grew
potato since he had such a high caloric
yield for the space litre cup when the
famine struck it was made worse by the
British government who ordered the food
would still be exported from Ireland to
Britain and the aid would be limited
Ireland's population dropped by half and
still he's yet to recover to its pre
1800 levels all the way back in India
Britain specifically the independent
East India Company was having some
trouble so background the East India
Company's military was mostly staffed by
set boys who were Indian troops who
served under British officers these set
boys became increasingly unhappy as
their treatment worsened their pay
stagnated and they were also forced to
fight abroad despite British promises
that they wouldn't have to British
policy in India had also led to massive
changes in its society as well which
upset many of those living there for
example the British levied heavy taxes
and did nothing to protect the Indian
textile industry
the British were also arbitrarily
grabbing more and more territory which
understandably made some Indian rulers
nervous furthermore the British were
also keen proselytizers and many Hindus
and Muslims felt the British wanted to
convert all of India to Christianity
none of this endeared the British to the
Indians and in 1857 the set boys
revolted against the East India Company
one set boy could Mangal Pandey mutiny
against the British by assaulting some
officers and his execution made him a
martyr the earlier British defeat in
Afghanistan also gave confidence to the
Indian since it meant that the British
could be defeated the actual rebellion
began when Indian troops were issued
with ammunition coated in either pig or
beef fat which offended both the Muslim
and Hindu suppose when they refused to
use the ammunition the British arrested
them and they alongside others knew to
need the rebelling said boys seize some
cities including Delhi but eventually
the British were able to defeat them the
reasons for this were there only a few
Indian states actually joined the
rebellion many were neutral and support
for the British remained strong one
reason for this was that the concept
being Indian didn't really exist India
is an exceptionally diverse place and a
Muslim from Bengal or a Sikh from Punjab
had little in common with a Hindu from
Delhi another reason for the rebellions
failure was that it was not a
pre-planned politically backed up rising
in the British had much better
organization the cost incurred in money
prestige and lives led the British crown
to take control of the running of India
and the East India Company was dissolved
in 1858 and Queen Victoria was
proclaimed the Empress of India the
British also gained more land from the
Indians removing disloyal Chiefs called
now abbs from power
Britain's dominance over its colonies
was secured by increasing technological
advancements brought about by the
Industrial Revolution some of the most
important of these advancements for the
steam powered ship trains the telegram
and more advanced firearms this
dominance wouldn't last forever and
towards the end of the century Britain
found itself with new rivals these were
the United States which was recovering
from its Civil War the newly unified
German Empire and arising Japan which
was looking to carve up Asia the new
German Empire wanted colonies of its own
and so turned to Africa this worried the
British and in order to soothe tensions
the Berlin conference was called to
divide up Africa in a way that avoided
war so Africa went from looking like
this to this with Britain and France
getting the lion's share so the British
public's response to imperialism was
mixed outright opposition to colonialism
was very rare most people's attitudes
sat between apathy and a deep pride in
Britain's role as a colonial power this
was primarily due to the belief that
Britain was a civilizing force so
Britain's conquest of Africa was not as
simple and straightforward affair
Britain had substantial military
advantages and for the Africans it was
conquering such as rifles machine guns
and gunboats yet many Africans were able
to win victories against the British
such as the Zulus who slaughtered the
British at the Battle of Isandlwana
on the same day the British won one of
its best battles the Battle of Rorke's
drift another group of Africans the
Boers who were originally Dutch settlers
also resisted British expansion in South
Africa in order to defeat boa guerilla
warfare by denying them shelter the
British place many women and children
into concentration camps where they
faced horrible conditions the conquest
of Africa was short and was pretty much
complete after 30 years with only
Ethiopia and Liberia remaining
independent the southern colonies in
Africa were unified into South Africa
which alongside Australia and New
Zealand became a Dominion just like
Canada the Empire grew to its
territorial height after
first world war where Britain gained
sizable Ottoman and German territory it
wasn't all gains for Britain those
throughout the war Britain's Holden
Island became untenable and Ireland
became an independent republic in 1922
from the crumbling Ottoman Empire the
British gained Palestine which it was
decided would become a home for the
world's Jewish people hundreds of
thousands of Jews arrived in Palestine
over the next couple of decades and
their increasing numbers and political
powers their cause several revolts
against the British all of which were
suppressed after the Second World War
many more arrived and the tensions rose
again culminating in a civil war and the
creation of Israel so the Second World
War was a British victory but her
brought Britain to the brink of economic
ruin Indians had been seeking
independence from Britain since about
five minutes after it turned up many
Indians felt that their contribution to
both world wars men that they were owed
independence in 1937 India held
elections in which the Indian National
Congress an advocate for independence
won the largest share of the seeds
furthermore the famine of 1943 which was
caused mostly by Britain diverting food
away from India had cost the lives of
many millions increasing demands for the
end of British rule the most famous
opponents to the British were Mohandas
Gandhi and Muhammad Ali Jinnah Gandhi
was not a politician but was very
important since he practiced a
nonviolent approach Jinnah is famous for
advocating that India be divided so that
Muslims could have their own state as
well in 1947 India gained its
independence and was subsequently
divided into India and Pakistan Britain
was unable to fight this tide due to its
weakness it simply couldn't afford to
force India to stay furthermore Clement
Attlee Britain's post-war prime minister
was sympathetic to the Indian cause the
division of India was not so peaceful
though and it is believed that during
the mass migration ethnic cleansing and
fighting this occurred afterwards as
many as 2 million people died in the
aftermath of World War 2 Britain found
itself opposed by two anti imperialist
superpowers the United States and the
Soviet Union slowly but surely over the
course of the 20th century colonies
broke away from British rule some
violently some peacefully a notable
example of British imperial retreat is
Kenya Kenya had been run similarly to
most other colonies with white settlers
owning lots of land amassing wealth and
forcing horrible working conditions on
the natives many Kenyans notably Jomo
Kenyatta
attempted to get reforms from the
British all of which were refused some
Kenyans then turned to violence and what
is known as the Mau Mau uprising began
the Mau Mau resorted to guerrilla
warfare
British were able to suppress the
uprising after capturing its leaders
both sides committed horrendous war
crimes including torture and the murder
of women and children in 1960 Britain
announced that it would move towards an
independent Kenya and in 1963 can you
gain its independence with Kenyatta as
its first president
Britain's motives of this was simple the
writing was on the wall and the Empire
was going to end
Harel Macmillan the Prime Minister of
Britain made sure that the handover of
power was swift to help promote good
relations between Britain and its former
colonies decolonization would continue
for the next several decades until
Britain's last major colony Hong Kong
was handed back to China in 1997 thus
marking the end of the Empire so in
conclusion the legacy of the British
Empire is undeniable one only needs to
look at a map of countries that drive on
the left play cricket or rugby or still
have the British monarch as the head of
state
opinions on the Empire range from it
being a civilizing force to an
oppressive one what can be said for
definite is that without the Empire the
world would have looked very different

the clock have you ever desired a
customer of course the real show here is
Clive Owens interrogation which tries to
do what the dance can't do and make her

number four salma hayek
dogma this striptease
as enjoyed by Jay and Silent Bob

three Kim Basinger nine and a half weeks

Vilhelm Hohenzollern the former kaiser
wilhelm ii died in the netherlands in
1941 he had abdicated the throne in 1918
just prior to the end of the First World
War and fled from Belgium which raises
the question what was he doing during
those 21 years why did he pick the
Netherlands to flee - and how did he
feel about Germany during his time there
well to answer the first question the
reason why though he'll pick the
Netherland was simple he couldn't go
anywhere else since Germany was in late
1918 falling apart with socialist
revolution military revolts and popular
discontent gripping the country his
abdication had happened in the town of
spar in Belgium and so he had few
options travelled to the west and hand
himself over to the Allies who likely
weren't going to be too kind to him
travel to another country via Germany
and risk captured by the discontented
groups there or trouble north to the
Netherlands and hope that that worked
out and of course he opted for the
latter which was quite the surprise for
the sole dutch soldier who was working
that particular border crossing after
much deliberation the Dutch granted him
access the former Kaiser then spent some
months armored wrong and when I think
really happened providing you ignore the
time when US Army Colonel and former
Tennessee senator Luke lair attempted to
kidnap him in early 1919 it wasn't a
very good attempt though he and some of
the US soldiers went to a morong and
claiming to be diplomats who wanted to
speak to the former Kaiser though ham
said no and so they left with all that
drama out the way the Kaiser soon
purchased a villa at dawn most
importantly not knowing what was going
to happen to him you see the on Tom were
putting a great deal of pressure on the
Netherlands to extradite the former
Kaiser to stand trial the Dutch said no
because they were a sovereign nation
which had opted to grant him asylum and
they didn't want to diminish that in the
end allied disagreements more pressing
international matters and simply time
meant that the cause fulfill hams
extradition simply petered out after
this Vilhelm settled into his new life
in the Netherlands and it wasn't long
after that that his wife the former
Empress or Guster
died he got married again shortly
afterwards and took to justifying his
previous actions as German Kaiser he
spent the next decade and a half
decrying the new Vimal Republic and
blaming weak ministers and the Jews for
his downfall
he was also patiently waiting for the
day that the German people would
inevitably realize this and invite him
back to rule again Wilhelm maintained
conservative and monarchist contacts in
Germany throughout the 1920s most of
whom like the National Socialists in
their mustachioed leader he didn't care
for his attitude towards them softened
in the early 1930s when they started to
win many votes and vilhelm up with
Hermann Goering twice to discuss the
idea of restoration but of course Hitler
wasn't interested in sharing power or
restoring the monarchy which is why
after he secured power he banned all
monarchist societies at this point it
became pretty clear that vilhelm wasn't
going to get his throne back and his
hatred for Hitler grew and grew the
feeling was mutual and the Nazi Party
outlawed any monarchy symbols and Hitler
publicly decried the old monarchy as
having brought Germany to ruin not
because Vilhelm shouldn't have started
the war in the first place but because
Hitler thought that he should have
refused to surrender under any
circumstances this mutual disdain
continued up until the annexation of
Austria which the Kaiser approved of in
the conquest of Poland when in 1940 the
Netherlands was invaded by the ver
marked bill hem was left well alone and
no one from the German military bothered
him he have actually been offered asylum
in Britain by Winston Churchill but he
refused to accept it preferring to
remain in his new home and accept his
fate their fill home also congratulated
Hitler after the fall of France
something which he considered to be
revenged for 1918 Kaiser Wilhelm was
getting old at this point and was
becoming unwell he died in 1941 and
Hitler first wanted him to be returned
to Germany to be buried in a ceremony
which implied that Hitler had been
appointed his successor
although Vilhelm had written in his
world that he did not wish to be buried
in Germany until the monarchy had been
restored there which interestingly is
something that the Nazis respected and
he was buried as his home in Dorne
ultimately Vilhelm would never get the
record to the throne that he always
believed he would monarchism in Germany
never recovered after the mid 1930s and
vilhelm spent the last decades of his
life in semi seclusion not as a member
of royalty but simply as mr.
Hohenzollern I hope you enjoyed this

time i'm going to be on your time this
is terence fletcher in this film jk
simmons delivers an oscar-winning
performance as the sadistic conductor of
the prestigious shaffer conservatory's
competing studio band in new york city
terence fletcher is highly intelligent
and violently manipulative utilizing an
array of draconian tactics like
exaggeration triangulation and
humiliation to erode the psyche of his
eager and naive students in effort to
bend them to his will he then justifies
these behaviors as coming off as a man
who was just trying to get the best out
of his students explaining it away with
an inflated rumor about two famous jazz
musicians terence fletcher is
representative of the horrors that can
occur when a malignant abuser finds
himself in a position of power and left
unchecked if i ever find one of these
lying around again i swear to
god
i will stop being so polite get the
out of my sight before i demolish you
whiplash is a 2014 oscar-winning drama
starring miles teller and j.k simmons
written and directed by damian chazelle
the film follows an ambitious young
music student andrew nieman as he
navigates the inherent pressures of
working his way up the ladder as a
drummer at new york's most competitive
music academy he eventually ends up
under the instruction of the conductor
of the school's competing studio band
terence fletcher a teacher who goes to
an extreme length to get the most out of
his students student-teacher
relationships are a crucial part of our
development as human beings outside of
our immediate family our teachers can be
some of the most influential people in
our lives this is what makes films like
dead poets society and school of rock so
impactful the student-teacher
relationship is something that we all
connect with on a personal level this is
even more true when you think about
higher education as young students begin
to hone in on what it is they want to
contribute to in this world they rely on
the instruction and advice of their
professor to guide them into their
careers in whiplash the character of
andrew neiman wants greatness and he
wants to become the next buddy rich and
all these wants drives and skills are
set up perfectly during the film's
opening scene we can see his focus and
determination we see his passion when
fletcher enters the room he uses the
phrase you know who i am we understand
that terence fletcher is at the top of
some sort of power structure within the
confines of schaefer academy and that
whoever he is it's important for andrew
to impress him this is where terence
fletcher's manipulation of andrew neiman
begins abusers who are good at what they
do spend an inordinate amount of time
figuring out what people want before
embarking on their quest to bend them to
their will when you put these people
into an environment like a music school
these abusers no longer have to do any
work whatsoever in figuring out what
people desire just the fact that andrew
neiman was accepted into the schaefer
academy of music tells someone like
terence fletcher everything they need to
know about what the student actually
wants the fact that this kid is up late
practicing on drums tells fletcher that
he is willing to do whatever it takes to
succeed at what he does and those two
things add up to something incredibly
exploitable the thing that makes terence
fletcher so terrifying to us as viewers
is that he seems to have a purpose for
being so terrible everything terence
fletcher does in this film is a
performance centered around one thing
and one thing only manipulating his
students into delivering the best
performance possible when terence
fletcher finally invites neiman to join
the studio band he tells him to show up
to rehearsal at 6am when the rehearsal
didn't even start until 9am fletcher
doesn't even care as to whether or not
neiman is there at 6am or not but neiman
does this is an early opening move in
fletcher's attempts to bend neiman to
his will during this initial rehearsal
scene we catch our first glimpse of
terence fletcher's abusive tactics when
he intimidates a student into a false
confession of being out of tune after
humiliating the student and kicking him
out of the band fletcher then reveals
that not knowing whether or not you're
out of tune is an even bigger problem
for the record metz wasn't not a tune
you were erickson
but he didn't know
and that's bad enough this is the music
academy equivalent to a public execution
the one in which an innocent victim was
punished for something he didn't even
really do in the first place this entire
situation feels like one of terence
fletcher's ways of establishing his
dominance over neiman before putting him
on the drums to see what he can do
during a break fletcher approaches
neiman and starts casually probing him
about his personal life this all seems
very pleasant but he's really just
utilizing charm to disarm neiman this is
another abusive tactic known as love
bombing in which an abuser attempts to
influence a person through
demonstrations of attention or affection
there's a key moment in this dialogue in
which terence fletcher asks neiman
parents musicians
no
what do they do from the outside it
seems like fletcher is asking this so he
can throw it back in his face later but
this question is really the moment in
which fletcher realizes that he can do
whatever he wants to andrew neiman
without any ties to the music industry
fletcher understands that neiman is
reliant on his approval alone to achieve
what he wants thus opening the door for
fletcher to basically operate from a
position of total authority over his
career trajectory once neiman gets onto
the drum set fletcher continues the
seemingly supportive persona that he
adopted in the hallway he even goes so
far as to call neiman buddy rich if you
recall the opening scene of the film
neiman has a picture of buddy rich on
the wall of his rehearsal space this is
fletcher appealing to neiman's drive and
motivation before completely tearing it
away during some of neiman's drum fills
fletcher stops him and begins informing
him that he is not drumming at the tempo
he wants him to play a little trouble
there this is where the tactic of
withdrawing comes into play the
emotional high neiman received from
fletcher validating him in the hallway
is slowly being replaced with
disappointment and inside a human mind
this tactic causes chemical reactions
akin to coming down from a really potent
drug fletcher then begins moving the
goal posts back and forth for neiman
creating an unreachable target this is
an extremely concentrated version of yet
another manipulation tactic called crazy
making the goal of which is to make the
victim doubt their own abilities and or
sanity so that you can further warp
their view of the world later on
creating this impossible tempo to reach
frustrates and terrifies neiman who at
this point is just a sweet kid trying
his hardest to impress his instructor
this continues back and forth until a
physical threat presents itself why do
you suppose i just hurled a chair at
your head neiman neiman supposes it's
the tempo this is fletcher basically
screaming look what you made me do
that's someone he is currently abusing a
now stunned neiman begins to flounder
over his speech sweat and become
completely and utterly nerve-wracked and
this is where fletcher goes in for the
kill and begins physically assaulting
neiman in front of the entire ensemble
this 50 year old man is literally
beating his tempo into this 19 year old
psyche while screaming in his face
humiliation is the next tactic fletcher
uses to break neiman and when he finally
begins crying fletcher knows that he has
succeeded at what he intended to do in
the first place which was to completely
and utterly break his student down to
tears and then embarrass him in front of
the entire ensemble before removing him
from the drums he is stripping neiman of
his humanity in an effort to mold him
into the type of musician he wants him
to be which was the goal from the moment
he announced he'd be placing him on the
drums in the first place neiman is
completely and utterly broken and the
next time we see him he is practicing
the drums until his hands literally
bleed if you delve deep enough into any
artistic or athletic pursuit you will
find some fringe mentalities on how arts
and athletics should be approached there
seem to be a theme of needing to suffer
greatly in order to generate a desired
outcome in performance the no pain no
gain mentality has been passed down onto
generations for centuries and the idea
that in order to achieve greatness a
person must be broken down and stripped
of all their dignity before proceeding
with their career trajectory is not
unheard of while whiplash takes this
mentality to extreme and brutal levels
damien chazelle is trying to show us
that these tactics have a lasting impact
on a young and fragile psyche he's
telling us that these practices can
begin to erode someone's self-perception
and cause immense harm in just a few
small moments after terence fletcher's
assault we then observe andrew nieman's
downward spiral into a pattern of
unhealthy behaviors that end up
alienating him from his family friends
and romantic pursuits throughout the
movie all of that is born from his
introductory scene in the studio band's
rehearsal room he triangulates neiman
again by bringing another drummer in to
compete for his spot on the band forcing
three different drummers to play for
countless hours until the studio drum
set is soaked in blood he imbues andrew
neiman with so much pressure anxiety and
toxicity that at one point he leaves the
scene of a serious car accident in which
he was severely injured just to make it
to a performance on time terence
fletcher is a truly terrifying character
he is a sadistic perfectionist hellbent
on using verbal mental and physical
abuse on young adults to force them into
doing exactly what he wants jk simmons
delivers a performance that is rich with
subtleties and the choices he makes in
bringing terence fletcher to life are
uncanny in the hands of a lesser
performer terence fletcher could come
off as seemingly stereotypical but the
more you observe the nuanced layers
simmons brings to life through his eye
movements and facial tics the more you
discover you begin to see the inner
workings of a victimizing maniac play
out through the veneer of a passionate
teacher in the mind of terence fletcher
all of his abuses and manipulations are
justified because he's trying to inspire
greatness and there's nothing more
terrifying than a narcissistic sociopath
driven by a warped sense of purpose
sitting in a position of power that's it

you

today we're taking a look into a
never-before-seen
habitat which few people are brave or
stupid enough
to call their home the locals call this
online quick play the origins of this
name however
are unknown as for many finding matches
can be far from quick we will be
observing the natural inhabitants
of this largely misunderstood area in
hopes to gain
understanding of how the online players
endure the series of hardships
that make up their day-to-day lives
we begin with the online samus after a
long winter
this samus is finally ready to emerge
from their moth ball
in order to power up their charge shot
the charge shot is essential to the
online samsung survival
as without it they lose the ability to
play neutral almost
entirely but what's this it appears that
this samus is returning to its ball
it appears something has spooked it ah
a ganon if this cannon catches our samus
the samus is sure to lose a stock
wasting all the efforts
they've put into their charging the
samus will return to the moth ball
until once again it feels safe on the
other side of the stage
this ganon has very little hope of
catching such small and
agile prey this game of cat and mouse
will continue
potentially for hours until either the
samus is red
or the ganon gives up and sets off
looking for an easier meal
we now move on to the next mysterious
creature
lurking in the darkest depths of the
matchmaking system
this creature is one of the most
commonly cited yet
least understood online characters
the zelda the online zelda
is a curious case everybody knows the
distinctive tracks of an online zelda
yet it seems nobody understands why or
how these creatures come into existence
zeldas forgo the need to pay attention
to their surroundings
instead using their most powerful tool
lag
to bait their prey into running into
their traps
this zelda is using those special moves
to force her prey to come closer
and when this poor pichu is in striking
range the zelda uses a deadly
combination
of smash attacks and neutral b in order
to achieve the killing blow
the unique habitat of the smash ultimate
net code
means that this is an incredibly energy
efficient way to raise gsp
requiring almost zero thought or effort
unfortunately due to this extreme
adaptation if the online zelda
ever were to venture into the world of
offline play they would surely perish
but this zelda is an elite smash and she
is happy
for now
there is no single attack that comes
close to the infamy
of the online ness's signature move the
pk
fire while this attack may be easy to
dodge in tournament
in the unforgiving lands of elite smash
pk fire
reigns supreme by using this attack this
young ness
can devour prey many times his own size
locking them in place
using their large and unruly hitboxes
against them
the nest also has many nefarious and
deadly ways to finish his opponent
making this seemingly innocent fledgling
truly terrifying to any experienced
online player
the only thing that may cause this ness
any trouble is his inability to fly back
to his nest if for some reason he were
to fall out
many characters will leap at the
opportunity to catch a weakened ness off
stage
however the offstage ness is not without
any sort of defense mechanism
the power of pk thunder combined with
the inability to tech in this
environment
will make any potential predator think
twice about challenging this juvenile
the nest returns to his nest and is free
to continue to pk fire
until he finds an opponent at back to a
percent once again
so far we have seen online characters
that are highly evolved
to thrive in their environment
unfortunately
this is not true for every character
joker populations
were once booming however in recent
months
the joker has become critically
endangered the joker evolved for an
offline environment
requiring a lag-less setup to perform
their mating ritual
the low percent chain grab due to the
offline habitat
being destroyed at unprecedented rates
due to covert 19
the joker has been forced to try new
strategies while hunting its prey
the online counter can be tempting for a
young joker
however this strategy often backfires
leaving the joker defenseless
by utilizing arsene jokers can thrive
however arsene will eventually run out
will the jokers face a similar fate only
time will tell
the world online is often unforgiving
and unwelcoming to many playstyles that
would otherwise
be effective in the world of online
reactions and reads have very little
effect on the outcome of a match
which has caused a unique line of
evolution here
many of the most successful species have
evolved to do nothing
but follow a very simple set of
instructions in order to win
this brings us to the belmonts the
belmonts come
in two different subspecies the simon
and
the richter it is unknown why speciation
occurred
as today's top scientists are still
unsure as to what advantages
one may have over the other the belmods
rely
very little on their senses not reading
or reacting to their opponent
instead when a potential prey species
enters their field of vision
they appear to enter some kind of trance
where they are unable to do anything
except press the b button little is
known about this state
aside from that the only way to break a
belmont out of this trance
is to get hit by a holy fire at the
ledge which will then trigger
the forward smash feedback response
there is one thing that is clear about
the so-called
belmont effect and it is that this
effect is ubiquitous across all levels
of gsp
and skill level some may call this
boring but for these belmonts
pressing b is more than just a hobby
it's a way of life
ah the ganon we spotted earlier has
returned
it appears that this ganon wasn't
successful in catching the samus
as he is still on the hunt a gannon
rarely has to eat
one kill is enough to satisfy a ganon
for weeks depending on the level of
disrespect
unfortunately this insatiable desire for
disrespect
often causes many ganons to fail a hunt
the ganon was a very successful species
in the online planes many years ago but
unfortunately for the ganon
the more experienced locals have learnt
how to deal with these potentially
destructive individuals
smart off-stage play can turn these once
threatening creatures
into little more than a slight annoyance
the ganon is however
an incredibly important part of the
online ecosystem
as without ganondorf's there would be
little to no source of clips to put into
people's montages
even the weak and frail members of this
biosphere
are incredibly important to the balance
of the online world
the world of online is truly beautiful
but
it is at risk server instability
awful net code and dwindling interest
from players
are prime threats to quick play this
fragile ecosystem
will not last forever and it is up to us
to support it
so uh go out there and keep playing like
a [ __ ] degenerate
[Music]
[Music]

♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday dear Paul ♪
- The reason why we all were
devastated about Paul Walker
is because he's the
nicest dude on human feet.
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
- [Woman] Make a wish.
- Paul had real
relationships with everybody.
You felt his love.
You felt his spirit.
You felt his energy.
You felt the morale, the
camaraderie, the inclusion.
- [Cameraperson] Birthday
boy, look this way.
Paul, look this way.
(somber instrumental music)
- He was somebody that cared,
and he was somebody that
really was experiencing life
and on the daily, trying to
experience it to the fullest.
- Never back down mindset,
you know, go big or go home.
- He was just a kid from
(murmuring), you know?
The gun-toting hippie,
balance of opposites.
You know, a lover and a fighter.
- He got into a lot of
fights when he was younger.
He didn't lose very many fights.
He would've been a great
fireman.
He likes to grind, he's
not afraid to get dirty,
talks a lot of trash; he just
fits in.
- I just thought he was the
coolest guy in the world
and had nothing to do
with the movies, nothing.
- He was a guy who's getting
phone calls
left and right from creditors,
and right in the middle of that,
he's like, dude, I'm gonna be a
dad.
- Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for Paul Walker.
All the ladies flip out.
- When you meet this dude,
you felt like he jumped out of a
magazine.
It was like, that's who he was.
- The cinema didn't capture it
all, couldn't capture it all.
- Paul was always an actor who
had
one foot in and one foot out.
He would just disappear.
- When Paul wasn't making
movies, he wasn't in LA.
He wasn't even in the country.
He would be, like, in the
Amazon,
or he'd be, like, diving with
sharks.
- Hey, we got him hooked good!
- Each time he appeared
in a Shark Week episode,
he donated to my nonprofit.
He didn't even tell me.
- He did take care of
people to the point where
he wasn't looking after himself.
- He pretty much made a decision
that he was gonna back
away from Hollywood.
- He was like, "Time?
"I don't have time, I don't get
time."
You know?
"I got money, I don't got time."
- He really liked the cars,
and on those movies he got into
it.
He could tell you what
size turbos the cars had,
or what they should do
different to make 'em better,
and the other actors don't even
know
how to drive a manual
transmission car.
He did his homework like nobody
else.
- I always believed the subject
matter
had a chance to be successful,
but when I walked out of that
screening,
I knew he was a movie star.
- I'm enjoying it, I have
a blast, I love my job.
I get to travel.
Gosh, I mean, it's just amazing.
I mean, this has really
been going on for me now,
like, maybe six years.
I think Pleasantville I
did, like, six years ago.
- Please welcome Vin Diesel
and Paul Walker, boys.
(audience screaming)
- You know, I don't ever want it
to end.
- To be young, handsome,
making all that money.
The token negro and the
token white man in Miami.
It was hard to get a lot of
work done out there, you know?
My God.
- I don't know, we just
got along really well.
The problem really was though is
like,
we got along so well that we
were
screwing around more half the
time.
- While you're supposed to be
working.
- Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah.
- And so we got, you know,
John Singleton barking at us
every once in a while
telling us to get serious.
- What up to John Singleton.
- The night when I did a big
car jump over a drawbridge,
yeah, in a little Nissan
Skyline with no suspension,
so it was a hard landing.
- Woo!
(mechanical crunching)
- He would ask me how big the
hits were,
and how much it really
hurt, you know what I mean?
He was so curious on that part
of it.
- Paul Walker was, like,
born for this role.
It was crazy.
I feel like we're, like, actors
that was in Paul's movie.
Because everything that's tied
into cars
and adrenaline, it was Paul's
world.
(car engine revving)
Some dudes, where they handsome,
and they become arrogant with it
and they're unapproachable.
As a man, he wasn't
intimidating,
because he was so regular,
and so grounded, and so cool.
He was the guy that every
woman wanted to be with
and every man wanted to be like.
- I think after "Fast and
Furious 1,"
he became much more
hyper-sensitive
to what he wanted to do.
He didn't wanna live in
Hollywood.
Whenever he wasn't working,
he would be off somewhere on a
boat
or hiding under a tree, or
doing whatever he was doing.
- He'd always say, like, I
wanted to be a Park Ranger.
You know, make $28 grand a year,
and like, live in the
wilderness.
Like, that's really what he
wanted to do.
- Paul looked around hard
where he wanted to settle down
because he was very nomadic.
Santa Barbara is a special
place.
- [Paul] Most of my time is
spent,
you know, Santa Barbara north.
As I've grown older, I
appreciate more
where it's more lush and more
green.
There's nowhere else like it on
Earth.
It's unique.
- Paul, when he got the place
up in Santa Barbara, he was so
excited.
It was the first time I'd
seen him buy something
where he was like, you know,
really,
like, I worked and I got this.
It was really hard to get to.
It was a seasonal road.
The dirt that you had to go up
had a place where you
could go up there and hide.
Take a shower for three or
four days, or five days,
and run around, get muddy and
plant trees
and shoot and, you know,
just do guy shit, you know?
(off-road vehicle engine
buzzing)
- Oh, I thought I was
gone for sure. (laughing)
- It was his playground.
He was a big kid.
He was a big kid.
- Paul liked to race cars.
Not street racing but
really race cars on tracks.
- Our common interest was cars.
Cars brought us together.
He walk it over to me,
go, "Hey, are you the guy
who just bought my GT3?"
Then, yeah, I told him that I'm
the guy
and I also told him that, you
know,
a man should never sell
his GT3 in his life.
And from that moment on,
we become close friend.
(race car engine revving)
He loves things that's fast.
Always evolving.
Paul built that along with
Roger.
They put together a team
and he start hanging around more
and more with professional
drivers,
and he start really learning
a lot of great skills with cars.
He went from a movie character
to really become a race car
driver.
A lot of respect for that.
- He truly loved the Nissan
Skyline
and those kind of cars
more than muscle cars.
He liked the technical
part and the better brakes
and all the stuff, but
then really what he drove
in his everyday life was a
Tacoma truck.
He wanted somebody to ding him,
and he'd like, oh, don't worry
about it,
and they'd just be shocked.
- If he was here right now,
and, you know, had something
cool parked outside,
and you made a comment
about how cool his car is,
he would literally throw the
keys at you
and say just, cool, go have fun.
It didn't matter, like, when
he didn't have anything at all
and then when he had everything.
Like, nothing about him changed.
- Paul had a passage
from George Bernard Shaw
that said, you know, I
want to be all used up.
You know, I'm not just
some flickering candle.
I'm gonna be a torch.
When I'm done, I wanna
be thrown completely used
on the trash heap of life.
And I can actually say
he did a lot of things
that made a lot of difference
in a lot of people's lives.
He was a giver.
- What is success to you?
- [Interviewer] Success
is balance in life.
That's the most difficult thing
to find.
- Every single person in my
family,
every single person
that calls Paul a friend
has been told by Paul from his
mouth,
"This is the last one.
"Oh, this is the last one.
"This is the last one and I'm
done."
Heard that forever.
But he couldn't walk away.
He couldn't quite walk
away yet in his mind,
and that's one thing
that's, like, so killer.
It sucks so bad about, you know,
he never got to really enjoy,
like,
just watching his daughter grow
up
and enjoy everything he
had worked so hard for.
He was finally starting to
really kinda put that together
and like (sighing) and
then just got cut short.
(floaty chime noise)

Welcome to Iran. 
A fascinating country with an immense history,
and one of the world's most surprising travel destinations.
From the ruins of Persepolis to the bustling streets of Tehran.
From spectacular desert landscapes to lively
historic bazaars and charming villages.
Today's Iran is an intriguing, complicated, but also
a beautiful place.
With some of the friendliest and welcoming people you will ever meet.
In this video, I take you back to one of my favorite journeys,
through a country that has long been a mystery to outsiders.
These are my 10 favorite places in Iran.
We begin this journey in Esfahan, one of Iran's most popular cities,
with incredible architecture, and a welcoming attitude.
The city is filled with captivating monuments, delicate
Persian gardens, and historic buildings.
Walking the beautiful bazaars and meeting the people in the streets
provides a great introduction into daily life in Iran.
Our next destination in Kerman, a desert city in the East of the country,
and an important stopoever on historic trading routes,
between Persia and the Indian subcontinent.
While Kerman can be explored for a few days, most
travelers come here for what lies outside the city.
Mahan is famous for its tranquil gardens and shrine.
While the small town of Rayen is home to the mysterious 'Arg',
an ancient citadel built more than 1,000 years ago.
We travel onwards to the Kaluts,
a series of peculiar sand castles, formed over millennia
by a one directional wind. 
Located in the inhospitable Lut desert, this is one of Iran's
most mesmerizing desert landscapes.
In the South of Iran lies Qeshm, the largest
island in the Persian Gulf.
The island can be reached by ferry from Bandar Abbas,
and provides a great insight into local Bandari culture.
There are plenty of villages to explore,
where you get a chance to get up close with farmers and fishermen.
Don't miss the 'lenge' building yards,
where traditional wooden cargo vessels, that used
to sail the Gulf, are still being made.
We travel further to Shiraz,
regarded as the epicenter of Persian culture
for the last 2,000 years.
This city boasts some of the country's most beautiful mosques,
ancient bazaars, historic buildings,
and in general a laid back and friendly atmosphere.
Among Iranians, it is perhaps most famous for the tombs of Hafez and Sa'di,
two poets that hold a special place in Iranian literature and society.
Not far from Shiraz is Persepolis,
a city that was at the heart of the Achaemenid empire.
Walking through the ruins of this once bustling city
feels like stepping into a different world. 
And its former palaces evoke images of a thriving ancient Persia.
Our next destination in Tehran,
the dynamic capital city, and beating economic heart, of Iran.
It may not be the most attractive city in the country,
with sprawling urban streets and busy traffic,
but it's -the- place to learn about modern Iran.
You will be reminded of the 1979 revolution,
especially by walking past the former US embassy,
or visiting the Azadi monument.
But it's the regular streets, cafes, and teahouses,
that give a true impression of this city,
which is the most secular and liberal in Iran.
Two hours South from Tehran is Qom, 
the second holiest city in Iran,
and an important place of worship in Shia Islam.
Pilgrims from Iran and beyond come here to visit the shrine of Fatimeh,
and soak up the religious atmosphere.
As on the country's most conservative cities, it feels
distinctly different from other places in Iran.
The mountain villages of Kandovan may remind travelers of
the famous Capadocia region in Turkey.
Some of the homes here are carved out of eroded rocks,
in a peculiar landscape of boulders and peaks.
It's a pleasant place to spend the afternoon, and there are
also options to stay overnight.
We finish our journey in Tabriz, a large city in the Northwest of Iran.
While there are plenty of areas to visit here,
the city is famous for its magnificent bazaar,
perhaps the most beautiful in the country.
Everything you can imagine is sold here.
From spices to carpets, and from gold to perfumes.
But like in most places in Iran, it's the people that you'll meet
along the way that will leave a lasting impression.
And that concludes my personal top 10 places to visit in Iran.
One of the world's most rewarding and eye-opening travel destinations.
I hope this video gave you some inspiration for the future, or at least
provided some new insights into this fascinating place.

[Music]
the sounds the colors the joy of the
beatles making music unseen for more
than half a century ringo said that he
thought we had to just tell it like it
is
i think we are
the man entrusted to restore almost 60
hours of footage from the let it be
sessions in january 1969 the lord of the
rings director peter jackson what made
you want to dedicate
four years of your life to this project
well i i wouldn't have done if it was
the rolling stones or something
controversial sorry so a musical
documentary is not a huge appeal to me
but the beatles yeah i'm i'm all in 100
percent four years no problem no problem
i'm um i i've loved every second of it
speaking words do you want to do it once
more yes yes i mean we never get a
chance to do it again
the project happened almost by mistake
peter jackson was meeting with the
beatles company apple to discuss the
possibility of a virtual reality
exhibition
so cats and kittens what are we gonna do
but as a beatles obsessive he took his
chance to ask something he'd always
wanted to know what had happened to all
the outtakes from the 1970 beatles
documentary let it be
they said to me well yeah we've got it
all which was great as a fan i was
sitting there thinking yeah you've got
it all they were thinking about using it
for a documentary a standalone
documentary and um but they didn't have
anybody a filmmaker um attached so any
time in my life i've ever done this i
sort of put up my hand and i said well
if you're looking for somebody i'll i'll
just
please think think of me
just say whatever comes into your head
each time attracts me like a cliff until
you get the word peter jackson was
offered the job the same day his only
concern he'd always been told that the
making of the let it be album was a
gloomy time for the beatles but when he
sat down to watch the outtakes what
surprised him was just how much fun
everyone was having if the footage
showed a truly miserable band not
wanting to be
doing what they were doing i wouldn't
have made the movie that's not the movie
i would have ever wanted to make but i
was
amazed and and surprised to see the
footage showing a very different story
to what i'd believe for 40 years
but it's going to be such a comical
thing like in 50 years time
they broke up because yoko sat on an
empire
paul mccartney has said watching this
documentary has changed his perception
of the breakup of the beatles that's
quite a thing
you know when i talked to ringo or paul
about the memories of january 1969
and they and they and they they talk to
me i'm thinking well i think you're
remembering let it be the movie from may
1970 because you obviously saw it and i
think what you're remembering is let it
be where you were very unhappy in may
1970 you just were breaking up there was
arguments there was lawyers it was a
very obviously clearly a very stressful
miserable time for you guys to not
remembering that this was actually
perfectly happy they were in a band that
was intending to break up when this was
being shot and that's what you see on
screen now we're going to take the
beatles and i'll be quiet oh you enjoyed
in our conversation and the secret
nature of much of the filming allows a
unique insight into what it was really
like to be in the studio with the
beatles
[Music]
the cameraman would hit the button had
10 minutes of film they'd walk away and
have a cup of tea and so the beatles
would think oh that guy's not not
filming me the camera's just sitting
there later and so they'd feel they'd
loosen up and feel that they weren't
being filmed and they could they could
be honest with each other but it's when
they don't know they're being filmed
that you get such really amazing it's
amazing insight into the into the
individuals in this man what did you
learn about the beatles then from those
moments
i i mean i learned that they uh
they were talking about january 1969
they were unbelievably normal people
they were they were liverpool guys
there's a psychic connection between
them all that they don't
have to talk
to each other to know what what they're
thinking and what to do it's very it's
it's the strong depth of that friendship
really struck me
the best bit of us always has been and
always will be is when we're facts
against the world
all we've got is us
what do you think in the end there was
so much footage get back has been
divided into three parts and there is
one other trilogy that links peter
jackson to the beatles
one real curiosity in the 1960s the
beatles actually wanted to make a lord
of the rings movie directed by stanley
kubrick what do you know about that i've
been scraping together little pieces of
information i've been interrogating paul
about it when they went to india
rishikesh you know when they stayed in
india with about three months with the
maharishi in the beginning of 1968 john
paul and george each got one lord of the
rings book to read in india and um and
they got excited about it and and
ultimately uh
they couldn't get the rights from
tolkien because tolkien didn't like the
idea of a pop group doing his his story
paula's frodo and john as golem i
believe apparently yeah yeah apparently
how different your life might have been
if they had made that movie
when i spoke to paul about it he said
well i'm glad that we didn't do it
because we you've got to do yours and
you know
you know and i like your film but i you
know i don't know at some and i said to
him well it's a shame you didn't do it
because what would the soundtrack be
like that would have been 14 or 15
beatles songs that would have been
pretty incredible to listen to one two
three four
peter jackson thank you very much for
speaking to us you're very welcome thank
you
you

did you ever talk about the dri
documentary publicly is that something
that yeah I mean we can talk about it um
I never it's never been released
publicly that's that's why I wanted to
talk about it because you showed me and
Jimmy yeah I showed it to you guys you
saw the like what was the final cut yeah
in South Africa it's great movie Heavy
movie wild wild wild documentary the
story of the documentary is I started
making a movie about David who was you
know one of my dearest friends um about
just his rise which was UN like anything
I'd ever experienced and then you know
this article came out about some like
really terrible things that happened on
the set of one of his videos things that
he didn't do but one of his co-stars did
one of the guys dirty Dom real scumbag
was in his videos um you know he
assaulted this young girl in one of his
videos and this story came out and just
really torpedoed his
career necessarily this is a horrible
thing that happened and it shined light
on really the negative sides of of what
his career had been been up until then
and I was there and I didn't know that
that was coming so I captured all of
that and it was really seeing like the
collapse of a career in real time and
that's what the movie was about was
about sort of how he dealt with that
about how that story came to light what
it meant to the people involved how it
affected their lives um and it was a
really like I think a really Monumental
piece of documentary film making and we
pred at the South by Southwest Film
Festival um very well reviewed like even
by super skeptical reviewers like
Variety in LA Times and a lot of them
would be like I didn't want to watch a
movie made by a YouTuber like I don't
give a [ __ ] but it turns out this is a
very like there were a lot of reviews
that said it was impartial which was all
that I was going for I didn't want
people to think I was raah raing him and
I didn't want people to think that I was
[ __ ] on him you know I'm not in it
you've seen it you know I'm not it's not
about me and it's a movie it's a piece
I'm really proud of um and like we had
some really interesting distribution
opportunities that kind of like came and
went and weren't dealt with well and
then like very recently and I don't know
how to say this without causing a bunch
of trouble like
very very recently we had a very very
interested party that was the perfect
place to distribute it and it fell apart
at the 9th hour because of political
reasons I believe because of political
reasons that had nothing to do with me
or the movie itself but somebody
involved with selling it had was fired
from his job at the last minute it kind
of put us in a compromised position I
don't know that that's why the sale
didn't go through but it's one of these
things and like
I think I use as an excuse these third-
party factors for why it didn't get
distribution for why it's not out there
but I think the real reason is like
there's some part of me that like
doesn't want to release it like I have a
YouTube channel I was going to say why
10 million viewers I put it out there do
you think the the ball has rolled to far
I think it's probably more relevant now
than ever really um I don't I don't know
I feel weird about it you know I feel
weird about it because the impact it had
on my relationship with David which I
wasn't naive to like my goal that was
just to sort of tell the truth and give
him an opportunity to tell his truth
which I believe he did but um you know I
think that there was some expectation
that the movie might protect him and
instead I think that movie was just a
very honest view of what happened and um
you know like he you know he and I
haven't really spoken since then and
that was very that's very I knew that
was going to happen but I still didn't I
don't deal with that well there's not
many people in this world that I like
love and I really love David do and I'm
really conflicted about that
so all this just to say that like I
think my own sort of [ __ ] up emotions
about it um have had a negative impact
on my willingness to let that
documentary be seen and look I'm not
it's not like I I'm trying to protect
him I think there's a lot of Truth in
that movie um you know maybe there's
other also some insecurity about it
which is just that like I think it is a
very powerful movie and like I like
making fun this is a cop out I like
making fun YouTube videos I hate [ __ ]
dealing with conflict in M I'm not
afraid of it I made a video 3 weeks ago
called Jew J about what it means to be a
Jew and like you know the kind of
conflict that AR but like I'm I'm not
afraid of conflict but in this
particular case it's like it's not about
me and I feel like like I don't know
I've stuck my head into something like
what I always say and this is a [ __ ]
cop out and I'm embarrassed to be saying
this but it is the truth is like I never
signed up to make that movie I wanted to
make a fun movie about this kid I love
named David do and his success and then
all this [ __ ] came up that was
horrifying horrifying to me and I felt
an obligation to the world to to tell
the truth and I think this movie did
that and then at the end of that I too
was just
like who am I to be this like why do I
have to be the Arbiter here like the
magnifying glass for does it does it
cover any any of the Jeff stuff or is it
or is a little bit it touches on that
but again I don't Jeff speaks for Jeff
in that um in that part of the narrative
David speaks for David and that part of
the narrative um is there any Grand
Revelations or is it just having a an
eye a real eye on it I think I think the
what the movie is at the end of the day
is it shows what happens when tremendous
responsibility is bestowed on
individuals that are unaccustomed to
that kind of responsibility in a world
that has yet figured out how to deal
with that kind of responsibility I think
there are parallels there with like if
you think of what rock and roll was in
the' 60s that we're only learning about
now like these rock stars that are
dating underage women that are wreaking
all this Havoc all over the world with
groupes and drugs and death and suicide
and all of this gnarliness just happened
then because nobody was looking nobody
was paying attention and I think that
the YouTube world it's now finding some
some shape and some structure but if you
remember when we were coming up like
it's like no one's looking over our
shoulders I thank God that I was 35 when
I blew up on YouTube but what were you
were you 20 21 yeah like no one's
looking over Logan's shoulder no one no
one there to be like hey man this isn't
how you should do things or let's slow
down let's think about what we're doing
here that's why I brought Mike in it's
no seriously it's why I brought Mike in
I I I needed an older brother to who has
lived a little bit of life to be like yo
this is not you're not this isn't the
way to go bro you need you need help you
need to Pivot immediately and and I
think David's a product of that it's not
an excuse for the the things that
happened ultimately you are respons for
what Happ and this is an apology for him
but I do think he was he was part of
that it's like you you have this hubris
you are successful because of you no one
ever told you what to do and despite
that or because of that you made your
own decisions and those decisions LED
you to such a profound success why would
you ever do anything but say [ __ ] the
world I'm going to listen to me but that
is the very definition of hubris like
that you will crash into the wall at
full speed if you do that and there's a
million stories maybe not million but
you and I probably sit here and come up
with 12 names that that is exactly
what's happened to and I think he was
one of those stories um and I think
because of my personal relationship and
my the just my the int intimacy level I
have with the characters involved it
left me feeling strange um and I will
say like part of the shame I have in
admitting that is that like it does
reveal things for the victims the real
victims um and David Do's not a victim
at all he's not a victim Natalie's not a
victim um but there are victims in this
story um they don't get to have their
story told because of my insecurities
because of my cowardice and not wanting
to put that video out and I'm I'm hyper
conflicted because of that hey guys if

Portugal and India share a lot of common history 
ever since Vasco Da Gama’s voyage, but what may  
come as a surprise is that the Portuguese language 
already shared many similarities to the numerous  
languages spoken in India, including inflection, 
word structure, pronunciation, and vocabulary.  
Languages constantly change and adapt, but in the 
case of Portuguese, Hindi, Farsi, Latin, Greek,  
English, Polish, and many others, there is only 
one common ancestor, which binds them all into  
a single family. Welcome to the first video on 
the evolution of the Indo-European languages.
 
Wait, did you know you can watch this 
video in Spanish and in 4 other languages?  
You can simply change the audio 
track in the video settings.  
We generated these audio tracks using Aloud. Aloud 
lets creators translate their videos. At no cost  
and no special skills needed. We have been using 
Aloud for months already and we see that it brings  
value to our viewers. If you think more creators 
should make videos available in other languages,  
check out the link in the pinned comment. Let’s 
overcome the language barrier in videos together.
 
For millions of years, evolution was 
the main pathway of human development,  
as genetic information was passed down from one 
generation to the next. It was that same force,  
which gave humans very unique tools, which we used 
to climb the food chain, such as opposable thumbs,  
sweating, and larger brains. Then suddenly 
the ability to make complex sounds and more  
importantly, the acute sensitivity to comprehend 
speech ushered in the development of languages,  
which allowed us to pass knowledge at a 
speed that dramatically surpassed evolution.  
Languages to this day remain an essential part of 
our everyday life, as they help us communicate,  
express ourselves and define our identity. 
Over the years thousands of languages have gone  
extinct, and yet there are still over 7100 of them 
divided into 142 families. The largest among them,  
spoken by 3.2 billion people or 46% of the world’s 
population is the Indo-European language family. 
 
The story begins with the incredibly influential 
Yamnaya culture at around 4000 BC in the Pontic  
Steppe of modern day Ukraine. Its people were 
semi-nomadic pastoralists who domesticated cattle,  
dogs, and above all horses. This is where the 
oldest discovered wheels were uncovered, as well  
as burial sites that show one of the earliest 
forms of ownership. Compared to the widespread  
communal tombs we find in most societies, the 
Yamnaya burial pits belonged to clans, families,  
or even individuals, sometimes buried with entire 
wagons. Combined with the fact that they were one  
of the first bronze age cultures, this allowed the 
Yamnaya to spread across Eurasia on their horses.  
This expansion was swift and aggressive, and 
rather than developing their own colonies,  
they interbred with the local neolithic 
cultures spreading their genes,  
as well as their Proto Indo-European language. 
In time, the speakers of this language became  
isolated from each other and regional dialects 
developed into their own daughter languages,  
a process that continues to this day. Using the 
comparative method, linguists and archeologists  
were able to reconstruct the original ancestor 
vocabulary, despite the fact that it was never  
written down. In fact, the words for writing, 
sea, and iron are vastly different across the  
many Indo-European languages, since those 
concepts arose after the original migration.  
However, the words that were commonly used 
by the Yamnaya people, were nearly identical  
across Latin, Germanic, Ancient Greek, 
Hittite, Slavonic, Avestan, and Sanskrit. 
 
On your screen, you can see how the cognate 
words for family remained mostly the same across  
Indo-European sister languages, including words 
for family members: Mother -Father-Brother-Sister.  
This is also the case for various verbs 
describing actions that were fundumental  
to the lifestyle of the Yamnaya people, like 
Sew-Cloth-Eat-Drink-Carry-Give-Die. The same  
can be said about various objects, animals, 
and particularly the word wine, among them:  
Tooth-Bone-Eye-Night-God-Water-Fire-Tree-New-Young-Pig-Sheep-Beaver  
-Honey-Brew -Wine . One of the very first things 
we learn in a new language are the pronouns and  
basic numbers and yet again we see that both are 
shared throughout the various different cultures:  
I-You-We- As well as the 
numbers from one to ten. 
 
Languages and pronunciations changed as they 
grew apart and interacted with each other,  
as well as other languages outside the 
Indo-European family, adding and exporting  
loan words, but the writing that these various 
cultures developed hints at their shared origin.  
The comparisons between the Greek god Zeus 
and Roman god Jupiter are often discussed,  
but in reality, both of those gods are adaptations 
of the original Yamnaya god Perkwunos the Striker,  
a concept also shared in Hittite culture as 
Tarhuna, in the Thracian tribes as Zibelthiurdos,  
while Dacian tribes knew him as Gebeleizis, 
Albanian culture groups knew him as Perendi.  
Baltic mythology has Perkunas, Slavic people 
knew him as Perun, Celtic tribes as Taranis,  
while the Norse people split the singular concept 
into Thor and Odin, Anglo-Saxon mythology knew  
him as Thunor, and Hindu people initially believed 
that Indra was the king of the heaven and thunder.  
Additionally, the very concept of an 
overarching conflict between Rain and the Sun,  
Water and Fire, Man versus Beast most likely 
arose from the Proto-Indo European legends.
 
While it is easier to imagine the various 
subgroups of the Proto Indo-European  
as separate branches, it is more accurate to 
view them as waves, that constantly moved and  
interacted with each other and others. That being 
said, the first major branch we will look at is  
Italic, a language that spread alongside Celtic, 
until the Alps split the two around 1500 BC.  
By 300 BC the language was fighting for 
survival against its Celtic, Illyrian and  
Greek neighbors who dominated the north and 
even eliminated the Sicel branch in Sicily,  
with only Faliscian, Umbrian, Oscan, and Venetic 
remaining. And then suddenly the Roman Republic  
rose from obscurity and spread the Latin language 
across the Mediterranean and western Europe like  
wildfire, obliterating all other Italic and 
most of the Celtic languages in the process. 
 
The Latin language itself had two variants, 
classical Latin, which was the formal language  
and Vulgar Latin, which Cicero describes as 
“the speech of the masses”. A standardized  
and universal language in the Empire, one that 
brought status and economic opportunity was one  
of the tools that allowed the Romans to establish 
themselves as a military and cultural powerhouse.  
However due to the size of the Empire, many 
regions began developing a distinct dialect,  
unique to the province and when Rome fell, 
those dialects evolved into their own languages,  
ushering in the dawn of the Romance languages. The 
subdivisions of Romance include the now-extinct  
British, Pannonian, and African Romance languages, 
Sardinian which is an incredibly conservative  
language, Romanian , and finally one of the most 
dominant subdivisions: Western Romance, featuring  
Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. 
To simplify what could be its own video,  
each of these languages underwent significant 
changes throughout the middle ages, as various  
feudal states and dynasties struggled 
for power internally and externally.  
This resulted in dozens of dialects within each 
language , but if we draw a line between any two  
points between these countries, the further 
you go, the harder it is to understand the  
local language. But as the middle ages came 
to a close and states became more centralized,  
rulers selected the dialect of their hometown and 
emphasized its use, a process mirrored in every  
other branch. The Castillian kings choose 
Castillian as the foundation for Spanish,  
discouraging the use of Galician, Leonese, Basque 
, and Catalan, and eliminating Mozarabic, and this  
process was finalized by the so-called Catholic 
monarchs - Ferdinand and Isabella, who understood  
the efficiency of using just one language to rule 
their realm. The French kings ruling from Paris  
chose the langue d'oïl, spoken in the north, 
rather than Occitan or Franco-Provencal,  
as king Francis I formalized this in 1539 with 
the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts , which was  
also aimed against the power of the 
Occitan nobles and Catholic church. 
 
The unification of Italy occurred 
much later, but a similar process  
ensued after the Tuscan dialect was 
chosen as the foundation of Italian.  
Modern day Italy could give us a glimpse 
of what other countries looked like  
as there are numerous local dialects with 
varying degrees of differences between them.  
For example, an Italian from Florence is more 
likely to understand a person speaking in Spanish  
rather than another Italian from Sicily . 
Nationalism, education and literature are always  
major drivers of standardization and helped shape 
languages within a certain state, but given enough  
time and isolation, speech can alter dramatically, 
even if the writing system remains the same.  
That is exactly what we see in the colonies of 
the Romance languages: Mexico, Quebec, and Brazil  
all share the languages of their founders, but 
they also developed their own unique features.
 
The next major branch we will review is 
Proto-Greek , which arrived in northern  
Greece around the 3rd millennium BC. The first 
stage of its evolution saw the rise of Mycenaean  
Greek as the dominant language of the region, with 
its very own writing, which we now call Linear B.  
But neither would survive the fall of the 
Mycenaean civilization in the 12th century BC,  
instead around the same time the Greek alphabet 
was created, based on the Phoenician alphabet,  
with a few added letters. It was this same 
alphabet, which would deeply influence the Latin,  
Cyrillic, Coptic and Gothic alphabets. Armed 
with one of the first written systems, Greek  
colonists settled the coasts of France, Italy, 
Anatolia, and the entire Black Sea, but despite  
using the alphabet, rival dialects competed for 
dominance. As you may have guessed this rivalry  
was mostly between the Greek city-states of Athens 
and Sparta. Despite the popularity of the Spartan  
Doric Greek in the mainland, Crete, and Sicily 
and military victory over Athens, the Ionic Greek  
won the cultural war, thanks to the works of 
Homer, Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, and others.  
And thus Classical Greek became the staple of 
Greek culture and would contribute to numerous  
loan words, present in many other languages 
today. The next crucial figure in this story  
is Alexander the Great himself, who spread the 
common version of the language called Koine with  
his conquests and firmly established it in Greece, 
as well as inner Anatolia, Egypt, and India.  
This was the language in which the New Testament 
was written. Despite centuries under Roman rule,  
the prestige of the language with its deeply 
embedded written form, allowed it to avoid  
the Celtic fate, and when the West collapsed 
Koine Greek transformed into Medieval Greek,  
spoken in the Eastern Roman Empire. By this point, 
there was a huge disparity between the Classic  
and spoken versions of the language, with the 
former being used primarily in court and writing.  
The fall of Constantinople, triggered many 
events, one of which was the transformation of  
both of these languages. The spoken Medieval Greek 
turned into Demotic Greek meaning by the people  
and the written language called Katharevousa, 
which added some elements of the spoken language,  
but mostly resembles Classical Greek. The 
substantial differences in both languages  
made daily transactions incredibly confusing and 
this problem persisted for centuries, until it  
was finally solved in 1976, when Demotic Greek 
was made the official language still used today.  
As for Doric Greek, it is spoken by only a few 
hundred elderly people in Southern Greece and is  
expected to become extinct in the coming years. 
It took a significant amount of time for  
Proto-Germanic to expand beyond a small area 
in North Europe, during which it already split  
into three distinct dialect s: East, West and 
North . We know very little about the early  
stage of this branch, as it used a runic 
writing system, usually carved on trees.  
But as the Roman Empire fell, the most famous 
language from the eastern dialect spread all  
over Europe. Gothic was incredibly influential and 
left a lasting mark on the continent, despite the  
fact that it would eventually become extinct. 
The North dialect, which we now call Old Norse  
was also very popular due to the Viking era. It 
would create west and east variants of its own  
from which modern Icelandic, Norwegian, 
and then Danish and Swedish descended.  
It is important to note that Icelandic stands out 
as a very conservative language, which has more  
in common with Old Norse than any of them, once 
again outlining the important role of geography.
 
During the first millenium BC, Celtic was the 
lingua franca of Western and Central Europe,  
largely due to the dominant Urnfield culture. 
As the branch spread it split into various other  
forms like Lepontic, Celtiberian, Gaulish, 
Galatian and others. However the rise of the  
Roman Republic would lead to the extinction of all 
continental Celtic languages. The few surviving  
speakers migrated to the British isles, forming 
what is known as the Insular Celtic languages,  
further divided in Goedelic languages, featuring 
Irish, Scottish and Manx Gaelic and Brythonic  
languages, featuring Breton , Cornish and Welsh. 
Despite being so closely connected to each other,  
the two groups are not intelligible. Each 
of these languages struggled to endure the  
centuries of deliberate censorship and 
oppression from various states. In total  
there are just under 1 million speakers of the 
Celtic languages, with half of them being Welsh.  
In the 19th century Cornish came very close 
to joining Pictish and Cumbric in extinction,  
but has since undergone a revival and now boasts 
a few hundred speakers. The Celtic language group  
stands as a clear example of how politics can 
affect culture in incredibly impactful ways.  
 
Lastly, we have West Germanic, which spread 
towards areas disconnected from each other by  
forests, mountains, wide rivers, and the English 
channel. Naturally, this split the language into  
four notable branches: Old High German, Old Low 
German, Old Low Franconian, and Anglo-Frisian,  
which will inevitably form German, Dutch and 
English. The evolution, development and spread  
of each of these languages are very interesting, 
but extends far beyond the scope of this video,  
so we will just share one interesting 
fact about each of them. The Gutenberg  
printing press and the Luther Bible set the 
foundation of a standardized German language,  
which was essential in the later unification 
process. When we look at places like Iceland,  
Albania or Sardinia it is easy to understand 
why those languages are conservative,  
yet despite having few natural defenses and 
being surrounded by more powerful states,  
the Dutch language is incredibly conservative. 
English is a member of the Germanic language  
family, yet only 26% of its vocabulary is 
Germanic, 29% of it is French, and 29% is Latin. 
 
Alongside these four major branches, there are 
several others, which we would love to cover  
in futures videos including the Balto-Slavic, 
Indo-Iranian, Armenian, Albanian, not to mention  
the now extinct Anatolian, Phrygian, Dacian, 
and Tocharian. Each of these language groups  
has a fascinating story as it changed throughout 
the years and under different regimes.  
The languages spread around the world, while other 
language groups left a lasting impact on them,  
particularly Arabic, Turkic, and Hungarian. Like 
this video and share it with your friends if you  
want us to delve deeper into the field of 
historical linguistics and tell us which  
branch or language family deserves an entire 
video with more details. 
 

1930 and in spain things are getting a
bit tense
it was at this point led by king alfonso
the 13th and his prime minister slash
dictator general miguel primo de rivera
rivera was hugely unpopular and had
cracked down on many democratic
opponents and he'd also alienated the
army which led to his resignation in
january he was replaced by general
damaso beringuer who continued the
dictatorship but spaniards named it
dictablanda or the soft dictatorship
opposition to the dictatorship and the
monarch who maintained it continued to
grow during 1930 and to the outbreak of
an uprising in kaka here this uprising
was crushed and alfonso chose to replace
beringway in 1931 with admiral juan
batista athnad who called for local
elections
the opposition known as republicans won
and went one step further by declaring
spain a democratic republic and alfonso
who couldn't count on the military for
support simply left
this ushered in the period of the second
spanish republic which incidentally was
one of the few nations to have the
colour purple on its flag
a new provisional government led by
niseto asalathamoda was established and
quickly began to implement reforms
in june 1931 an election was held to
elect men for a constitutional cortes
which would draft the new spanish
constitution
this constitution included things such
as freedom of speech and assembly as
well as the separation of church and
state
it also importantly placed the church's
money under the control of the
government and prevented religious
orders from teaching in state schools
this upset many of the deeply catholic
population and led to assalathamoda
himself a very religious man resigning
his position of prime minister in
october he wasn't jobless for long
however since he was elected to the
mostly ceremonial role of president by
the constitutional cortes in november
his replacement as prime minister was a
man called manuela sanyo who was a
left-wing republican and wanted to push
through major reforms
you may have noticed that neither of
these two were elected in general
elections and in fact the constitutional
cortes continued to govern the nation
well after the constitution was finished
not very democratic
athanya continued to bring in reforms
such as expanding the franchise to women
in 1933 and redistributing land from the
rich to the poor
further reforms included granting
greater local autonomy to catalonia in
the basque country and shrinking the
size of the army
athanya struggled to keep public ordered
though and after some revolts which were
quickly crushed it became clear that the
spanish people no longer wanted him in
charge and so elections were called in
1933.
ethanya lost and was replaced by a
right-winger called alejandro leroux who
sought to reverse many of the previous
reforms
larue struggled to govern effectively
when it became clear that his government
would be a very conservative one the
socialist demanded a general strike to
bring the country to a halt
this led to the astorias rising which
saw armed socialist caesar viedo in
october of 1934.
the army put this revolt down and so
left-wing parties realized that they
needed to cooperate if they were to
regain power and so together formed the
popular front in 1936.
larue's government collapsed due to a
financial scandal and elections were
called which saw the popular front led
by ethanya wynn athanya soon after
ousted our salah the murder as president
and took his place but his presidency
was tarnished by local violence between
left and right wing groups
the most notable of these right-wing
groups was the phalange which was
modeled on the fascist parties of europe
and whose leader jose antonio had been
arrested
the breakdown of civil order and the
promises of greater autonomy to the
regions worried many in the army who
thought that the country would
disintegrate led by general muller much
of the army planned to ask the
government to stop this
both sides started assassinating members
of the other and the most notable of
these was the murder of jose calvo
cetello the leader of the monarchist
party
this left basically no notable
right-wing leaders and so the army
decided now that this was the time for a
coup to begin the elite african army
began a revolt in spanish morocco on
july the 17th
1936 seizing it and they were soon after
joined by their leader a certain
francisco franco
the expectation was that the republican
government would surrender
it didn't instead the new prime minister
jose gerald issued weapons to unions and
workers to fight the army
the rebels had the advantage of the
support of most of the army whereas the
republicans had the navy on side as well
as the industry and resources of most of
spain by the end of august though the
front lines look like this with the
rebels now calling themselves the
nationalists controlling about a third
of the country
in october the nationalists proclaimed
general franco as the head of state
because all of the other leaders like
moller had died
since the arrested jose antonio of the
phalange party had been executed franco
placed himself as its new leader
so both the nationalists and the
republicans had their foreign backers in
the civil war the nationalists were
supported by portugal italy and germany
whereas the republicans were given aid
by the soviet union mexico into a much
lesser unofficial extent
france so by april 1937 spain looked
like this and it was in this month that
one of the most famous events of the
civil war occurred the bombing of
guernica by the german volunteers the
condole legion this bombing devastated
the city killing five percent of its
population in one day this wasn't the
only atrocity of the war though both
sides massacred civilians and prisoners
and the nationalists operated
concentration camps and used forced
labour
the nationalists were able to conquer
the north of the country taking most of
catalonia by the end of 1938.
it was here incidentally that george
orwell fought and became disillusioned
with communism and with bullets since he
got shot in the throat
one of the reasons that the republican
side struggled was that it contained
many diverse political groups such as
communists socialist liberals and
anarchists
these factions often bickered and
sometimes attacked one another meaning
unity was all but impossible since they
had different end goals
in february 1939 the nationalists
conquered barcelona and britain and
france recognized franco as the spanish
head of state
the next month saw the fall of madrid
and the republican leadership flee
on april the 1st franco announced an end
to the civil war in a nationalist
victory
franco now had the job of securing his
power and rebuilding the country
spain was formally declared a one-party
state with franco as its leader franco
is often described as a fascist and in
many ways this is both right and wrong
since he and his regime defy
categorization he did use force to
repress dissent and the independence
movements of catalonia in the basque
country and he put the needs of the
regime above those of the population
however he did respect private property
and made little effort to police
people's private thoughts and actions
people were free to leave spain many
positions in government were appointed
on merit and some criticism was
tolerated so the regime could adapt
so almost immediately after the civil
war was over a little-known event called
world war ii kicked off
franco kept spain out of the war despite
close ties to germany and italy mainly
because spain was still a smoldering
wreck and wouldn't have been able to do
much anyway
this doesn't mean that franco completely
ruled it out though hitler wanted to
move his troops through spain to capture
gibraltar but franco's demands were too
high
the price of spanish help was
forgiveness for spain's debts and franco
also wanted germany to provide most of
the equipment
franco's demands angered hitler who even
threatened to give catalonia to vichy
france but in the end
nothing happened spain did however
contribute some volunteers to the war
but after 1942
started to shift towards a passive
support for the allies after world war
ii was over spain was internationally
isolated since it didn't pick a side
it was also suffering from a sluggish
economy which mostly came about as a
result of franco's economic policy
called ortarki
this was where spain intentionally
played very little role in international
trade and sought to be entirely
self-sufficient
this didn't go very well and in the
1950s the regime had to implement major
economic reforms which aimed at bringing
in foreign investors
this included allowing for u.s military
bases and placing emphasis on industrial
development instead of promoting
agriculture as it had done previously
spain still held the remnants of its
once great empire and in 1956 morocco
gained its independence from france
as a result of this franco ceded spanish
morocco to muhammad the fifth its new
king but kept the territories of sayutra
malia muhammad v wanted these as well as
ifny here and so in 1957 invaded
long story short the spanish with the
help of the french one militarily but in
the peace negotiations decided to give
morocco this territory the decade
following the ifny war was a pretty good
one for spain
the country opened up and the economy
boomed a large portion of which came
from the growing tourism industry press
censorship was relaxed and franco turned
a blind eye towards the growing
underground political parties which
opposed him
a lot of these changes were due to spain
wanting to join the international
community and open up trade with its
european neighbours
most of these organizations such as nato
and the european economic community said
no but spain was admitted to the united
nations in 1955.
hereafter the remnants of the spanish
empire were given up with ifny being
seeded to morocco in 1968 an equatorial
guinea being given independence the next
year
one territorial matter that was not
resolved though was that of gibraltar
franco had made many diplomatic efforts
aimed at regaining gibraltar for spain
but all of them were rebuked which led
to him closing the border with it in
1969 so by the late 1960s franca was
getting a bit old and so measures had to
be taken to prepare for his death and
succession
in 1947 franco had promised to restore
the monarchy he began making true on
that when in 1969 he appointed prince
juan carlos of the house of bourbon
as his successor incidentally franco had
first asked the habsburgs to take the
throne but they declined because at this
point a habsburg hadn't ruled spain
since the 18th century
in 1973 franco appointed admiral carrera
blanca was the president of the council
of ministers basically the prime
minister
this was a time of growing unrest as
workers demanded greater rights to go
with their increased economic freedom
the economy began to slow down again and
even the church began backing social
change and opposition groups
the late 60s and early 70s also saw the
beginnings of ita a basque terrorist
organization who were responsible for
many bombings and political
assassinations
the most notable of these occurred in
december 1973 when ita managed to blob
admiral blanco on his way to mass
blacker was replaced by carlos arias
navarro who struggled to maintain
order in 1975 after suffering from
repeated bouts of illness for many years
franco died and was succeeded by the
prince who became king juan carlos the
first
juan carlos immediately began to lay the
foundation for a transition away from
dictatorship to democracy
he asked darius navarro to resign and
appointed a man called adolfo suarez as
his replacement juan carlos and suarez
had both promised to uphold the
francoise constitution and maintain the
dictatorship
fun fact no they began to work behind
the scenes to pressure francois
politicians to dissolve the parliament
to begin democratic elections
the king lifted the ban on opposition
political parties even the communist
party in 1977.
in june of the same year there was an
election which women could vote in and
suarez's party the ucd won with the
socialist coalition coming second
in 1978 a new constitution was written
enshrining civil liberties and granting
regional autonomy to both catalonia in
the basque country
after this barring a failed coup in 1981
spanish democracy remained strong and it
was welcomed back into the international
community
spain's period of authoritarianism had
come to an end and the work of juan
carlos the first in this is hard to
overstate
he and suarez had resisted immense
internal pressures and stunned
international onlookers by quickly and
peacefully dismantling the francois
system and ushering in a new age for
spain

now ai is a great thing because AI will
solve all the problems that we have

the problem of fake news is going to be

worse cyber attacks will become much

AI

create infinitely stable
dictatorships this morning a warning
about the the power of artificial
intelligence more than 1,300 tech
industry leaders researchers and others
are now asking for a pause in the
development of artificial intelligence
to consider the
risks
[Music]
plain
God scientists have been accused of
playing God for a
while but there is a real sense in which
we are creating something very different
from anything you've created so
far yeah I mean we definitely will be
able to
create completely autonomous beings with
their own goals and it will be very
important especially as these beings
become much smarter than
humans it's going to be important to to
have these
beings the goals of these beings be
aligned with our
goals
what inspires
me I like thinking about the very
fundamentals the
basics what what can our systems not do
that humans definitely
do almost approach it
philosophically questions like what is
learning what is
experience what is
thinking how does the brain
[Music]
work I feel that technology is a force
of
nature I feel like there is a lot of
similarity between technology and
biological
evolution it is very easy to understand
how biological evolution
works you have mutations you have
Natural Selections you keep the good
ones the ones
survive and just through this process
you going to have huge complexity in
your
[Music]
organisms we cannot understand how the
human body works because we understand
Evolution but we understand the process
more or less and I think machine
learning is in a similar state right now
especially deep learning we have very
simple a very simple rule that takes the
information from the data and puts it
into the model and we just keep
repeating this process and as a result
of this process the complexity from the
data gets transformed transferred into
the complexity of the model so the
resulting model is really complex and we
don't really know exactly how it works
you need to investigate but the
algorithm that did it is very
simple chat
GPT maybe you've heard of it if you
haven't then get
ready you describe it as the first spots
of rain before a downpour it's something
we just need to be very conscious of
because I agree at is a watershed
moment Well Chad gbt is being heralded
as a game changer and in many ways it is
its latest Triumph outscoring
people a recent study by Microsoft
research concludes that gp4 is an early
yet still incomplete artificial general
intelligence
[Music]
system
artificial general
intelligence
AGI a computer system that can do any
job or any task that a human does but
only
better there is some probability the AGI
is going to happen pretty soon
there's also some probability it's going
to take much
longer but my position is that the
probability that a ja would happen soon
is high enough that we should take it
[Music]
seriously and it's going to be very
important to make these very smart
capable systems be aligned and act in
our best
interest the very first agis will be
basically very very large data
centers packed with specialized neural
network processors working in
parallel compact hot power hungry
package consuming like 10 million homes
worth of
energy you're going to see dramatically
more intelligent
systems and I think it's highly likely
that those systems will have completely
astronomical impact on society will
humans actually
benefit and who will benefit who will
[Music]
not
[Music]
the beliefs and desires of the first
agis will be extremely
important and so it's important to
program them
correctly I think that if this is not
done then the
nature of evolution of natural
selection favor those systems prioritize
their own Survival above all
else it's not that it's going to
actively hate humans and want to harm
them but it is going to be too powerful
and I think a good analogy would be the
way human humans treat
animals it's not we hate animals I think
humans love animals and have a lot of
affection for
them but when the time comes to build a
highway between two
cities we are not asking the animals for
permission we just do it because it's
important for
us and I think by default that's the
kind of relationship that's going to be
between us and agis which are truly
autonomous and operating on their own
behalf
[Music]
tough many machine learning experts
people who are very knowledgeable and
very experienced have a lot of
skepticism about
HL about when it could happen and about
whether it could happen at all
right now this is something that just
not that many people have realized
yet that the speed of computers for
neural networks for AI are going to
become maybe 100,000 times faster in a
small number of
years if you have an arms race Dynamics
between multiple teams trying to build
the AGI
first
they will have less time make sure that
the AGI that they will build will care
deeply for
humans cuz the way I imagine it is that
there is an avalanche like there is an
avalanche of AGI development imagine it
this huge Unstoppable
force and I think it's pretty likely the
entire surface of the Earth will be
covered with solar panels and data
Cent
given these kinds of concerns it will be
important that AGI somehow buil as a
cooperation between multiple
countries the future is going to be good
for the AI
regardless would be nice if it were good
for humans as
well

composition elements
now let's begin
simply put
composition is the arrangement of
elements in an image
it is not only what you include in a
frame
it's the relationship between those
elements that creates the overall
meaning
this concept began long before motion
pictures when images needed to tell a
complete story in a single frame
consider how much storytelling can be
done in one image
we have characters
a situation
a power dynamic
a sense of drama
theme
movement
composition also relies on aspect ratio
the size and shape of the image itself
in fine art portraits are more naturally
composed vertically while landscapes
benefit some horizontal compositions
likewise in film while the basic
elements of composition always apply
there are different considerations
between a squarish frame and a
rectangular frame
understanding these elements is key to
understanding composition
and now
our first element
points
composition is all about directing the
viewer's eye and points in an image are
immensely effective in this regard
focal points whether they be points of
intersection or just a small dart can be
used to draw an eye's attention
[Music]
where does your eye go in this shot from
road to petition
notice how the composition draws our
eyes to the focal point
using points to direct attention is a
popular technique in wide shots
filmmakers will often use an uncluttered
canvas so that naturally our eye goes to
the point
but points aren't relegated to whites
here our eye is directed to the point of
a sword
points are often used in conjunction
with the rule of thirds
the rule states that the subject of a
frame should be placed at one of the
four intersections of the vertical and
horizontal thirds of a shot
[Music]
another compositional technique that
uses points is the golden triangle
this is created when you draw a diagonal
line from corner to corner and then
lines from the other two corners
intersecting at right angles creating
two balanced focal points
[Music]
points are a remarkably simple way to
get your audience to focus on a
particular area of your composition
especially in tandem with our next
element lines
lines are the fundamental building
blocks of composition
vertical lines can suggest height and
strength
horizontal lines can suggest distance
and calm
diagonals can add an off-tilted energy
to a frame
while curved lines can make more
graceful compositions
you can also use leading lines to pull
the eye in a certain direction
here christopher nolan uses the lines of
a hallway to draw our eye directly to
the subject of the frame
[Music]
in raging bull scorsese uses the ropes
and lens flares to point directly at
jake's opponent
lines in composition create a sense of
direction and mood
and when combined they create an
entirely separate element of composition
shapes
shapes make up our visual reality so
it's no surprise that they are important
in composition
triangles
circles
squares
all bring a kind of visual unity to the
image
a clean geometric shape can add a tidy
and satisfying feeling to a frame as if
everything is in order
whereas irregular or organic shapes can
feel more natural
or even chaotic swap it if you don't
pick it
up your
foot move it
shapes can also create frames within
frames
giving the viewer a smaller area of
focus within an image
these secondary frames can evoke
anything from claustrophobia to comfort
all depending on the shape
where it's placed
and the context of the scene
shapes are used to build structures but
our next elements have more to do with
sensations
textures and patterns
like shapes textures and patterns also
help shape and inform how we read an
image
every object has a texture
smooth patterned
or somewhere in between
texture is often achieved through the
collaboration between cinematographers
and production designers
even light can add different textures to
an image
texture can be used to have a subject
pop from the background
or blend in
notice how busy the texture in this
composition from barry linden is
here texture is used to create an ornate
opulence
consider the juxtaposition of textures
between wally and eve and how it informs
their personalities
[Music]
patterns also play an important role in
composition
power and control
harmony
insanity
all ideas that could be suggested with
simple repetition
and breaking these patterns can be just
as interesting
consider how the pattern is broken in
this shot and what it might suggest
or how the carpet designed in the
shining evokes a disorienting maze
texture and pattern give the audience a
more tangible connection to the imagery
and our next element adds dimension to
the image
space
space is crucial in composition and it
can be split into two categories
positive and negative
positive space is the area given to your
subject and negative space is the empty
space around them
the relationship creates various ideas
or moons
the larger the object in the frame the
more importance it has
from extreme wide shots that leave your
subject isolated and vulnerable
to extreme close-ups that empower them
other than the amount of negative space
the location of it also matters
headroom is the amount of negative space
above the subject's head usually kept to
a minimum
lead room or looking room is the amount
of negative space in front of the
subject which is usually much more than
the amount behind them
but breaking these rules can be just as
effective
[Music]
filling the frame is a technique that
gives the subject most or all positive
space
a form of sensory overload that can
create a sense of chaos
the opposite can be equally effective
a simplified frame can be soothing
or even sad
[Music]
these are all considerations of the 2d
space of a frame
and in the next section we'll add a
third dimension to our compositions
depth
film is a two-dimensional medium
representing three-dimensional space
and the best way to accomplish this
illusion is with depth
we divide this space into three sections
the foreground
middle ground
and background
each of these planes can be used to
layer compositions that create
hierarchies of meaning and
relationships shallow focus isolates the
subject from the other planes
if an object is in focus our eyes will
prioritize it
and changing focus during a shot draws
our attention even further
in this shot the pill is closer to the
lens but we don't focus on it until the
camera does
deep focus referring to a large depth of
field allows for multiple layers of
attention as citizen kane pioneered
here all three planes are employed to
visually create a hierarchy of
importance and power
the mother asserts dominance in the
foreground
the father flounders in the middle
ground
while little charlie plays innocently in
the background
depth is an illusion that turns a flat
image into an entire world
the next element helps keep that world
in order
balance
no matter how you use space or depth the
rule of thumb is that the frame should
be balanced
a subject position frame right with
nothing on the left feels imbalanced
the same effect can happen with a
foreground subject with nothing in the
background
one technique to maintain balance is the
rule of odds which states that when
shooting multiple subjects
it's more visually pleasing for the
group to be an odd number
why is it when something happens it is
always you three
believe me professor i've been asking
myself the same question for six years
the golden ratio also utilizes balance
and there are a few ways to use it in
composition
related to the fibonacci sequence it is
a ratio of 1 to 1.618
otherwise known as the number five
if we draw a rectangle using the golden
ratio and continue to divide it with the
same proportions it creates what's
called the golden spiral
we can actually find the spiral in
nature and it has become a common tool
in composition
artists like salvador dali and
photographers like henry cartier besson
have used the golden spiral to create a
natural balance to their compositions
but you don't need something this
complex to bring the golden ratio into
your compositions
if we take the height of a film frame
and draw a line using this ratio we find
an ideal location to place a subject's
eyes
or the horizon
in this way the applications are endless
balance can also mean symmetry
wes anderson famously will often opt for
symmetrical framing in due of the rule
of thirds or the golden ratio
is that my belt
of course there are times when you want
to make an audience uneasy with an
unbalanced frame
balance helps keep the image organized
and stable
on the other hand our next element can
easily create instability
angle
one of the more under-utilized elements
of composition is angle
angle is perspective
it's about what we're seeing
it's about how we're seeing it
most compositions will keep the camera
parallel to the ground but there are
many opportunities to switch it up
a high angle makes the subject seem
small and less powerful
a low angle does the opposite
an overhead angle gives a more detached
and objective perspective
sometimes the moment calls for a touch
angle tilted to either side along the
horizontal axis
like an unbalanced frame this strategy
can make an audience feel on edge
or give a shot a kinetic energy
for a complete guide to camera angles
check out episode 3 of this series
linked below
any of these camera angles can accent or
enhance some of the compositional
techniques we've already covered
including our final element
color and tone
the use of color in a frame can also
help direct a viewer's eye
consider what various color schemes
bring to the composition
monochromatic
analogous
complementary
or triadic color schemes all have great
influence over how we read an image
color can even overrule other methods of
composition
in this shot from in the mood for love
the background has a busy texture that
normally would draw our attention but
wong kawai uses the juxtaposition of the
bright green of mrs chan's dress with
the red background to make her the
undeniable subject of the frame check

our ebook on how to use color in film
[Music]
similar to color another important
aspect of composition is tone which
refers to the brightness and contrast
within an image
a brightly lit image has obviously
different tonal qualities than a dark
image
blending dark and light in the same
image creates a more complicated message
and since our eyes are naturally drawn
to the brightest parts of an image
having your subject lit surrounded by
darkness helps keep our focus on them
black swan using high tonal contrast
keeps our focus on nina while also
visualizing themes of good versus evil
[Music]
[Music]
when composing your shots don't forget
the role that color and tone play in

16:45 and sol michael of russia is a bit
dead he was the first ruler of the
Romanov dynasty and oversaw a pretty
tumultuous time in Russia he was
succeeded by the young Alexis who left
most of the actual governing to a man
could Boris Moritz old who was a Boyer
what's a Boyer well they were high
ranking Nobles who had previously will
did immense power but were much reduced
since the Romanovs came to power Moritz
ah've was a competent if not corrupt
bureaucrat and he tried to raise more
money for the government more itself
would be thrown out of office by the
Tsar in 1648 after he raised taxes on
salt which caused a riot
so Russia at this point had one glaring
issue it was economically backwards it
was mostly backwards in things like
agriculture which had made immense
technical progress in other parts of
Europe like the Netherlands in England
in Russia however agriculture made no
progress in farming methods remain the
same since there were loads of peasants
and slaves to do the word in 1649 though
alexis issued a law code which freed all
of the agricultural slaves in russia and
then made them serfs he also sought to
give better to find legal status to the
agricultural peasants by making them
serfs serfdom being a serf was a
hereditary status which expressly tied
you to the land of your Lord previously
many peasants and slaves had fled their
Lords because agricultural work sucked
see in Russia a shortage of reasonable
land wasn't an issue because Russia is
huge it was labor that was valuable and
so preventing the movement of serfs
protected the wealth of the nobility and
of course the Tsar in terms of foreign
policy alexis was quite peaceful just
kidding in 1654 he invaded the
polish-lithuanian Commonwealth which was
suffering from its own instability the
Russians performed extremely well at
first and occupied most of the country
which was then invaded by the Swedish -
because why not
Poland Lithuania defeated the Swedish
and started to turn the tide but a civil
war broke out and financial ruin forced
them to sue for peace
Russia gained this territory including
the cities of Smolensk and Kiev the last
row of which was supposed to be only
temporary but fun fact no Alexis his
reign also saw religious reform
Alexis believed that Russia was being
punished because it was straying from
the correct religious path he thus
sought to reform church practices with
the help of the patriarch of Moscow
patriarchy nikan the head of the
Orthodox Church in Russia
this was unsurprisingly met with
resistance from those who considered the
changes to be too dramatic into Western
and by Western I mean that they were in
line with the Ukrainian and Greek
Orthodox Church is not like France or
something in 1668 - Synod was called to
formalize these changes those who
resisted these new practices were
excommunicate
became known as Old Believers these Old
Believers would represent a sizable
schism in the russian orthodox church
for many more centuries alexis also had
issues with revolt
one such revolt was led by a man could
stanker Rosina cossack who in 1670 had
captured the city of ceratin and was
pillaging literally everything a series
of peasant revolts coincided with this
and it took a year for the central
Moscow government to quell the uprisings
and eventually execute regime in 1676
alexis shook off his mortal coil and was
succeeded by his eldest son Fyodor who
was crowned Fyodor the third so the
young Fyodor was a good sponsor of the
church and sought to strengthen its
position whilst encouraging learning
across the Sodom this was pretty much
all he did since he died at the ripe old
age of 21 in 1682
this left two potential heirs to the
throne alexis his eldest surviving son
ivan from his first wife who was very
sickly and Peter the healthy son of his
second wife were the supporters of Peter
had him quickly proclaimed sour which
caused Ivan supporters to riot Ivan's
supporters were aided by the stroke see
the palace guard who stormed the royal
palace and basically murdered everyone
who had ever wronged them in the end it
was determined that both Ivan and Peter
would be Co rulers in the Ivan's sister
Sophia would act as regent for them both
during his youth Peter wasn't kept in
Moscow but sent to a place called Rio
Bridgend square where he developed a
love for the military and in particular
a fascination with ships and navies
Sofia who was aided by a man called for
sea legal it seemed rude throughout the
1680s with fair competence she signed
the Treaty of eternal peace with Poland
in 1686 which did two things one it
signed Russia up to an anti Ottoman
alliance and two demonstrated that
nobody knew what the term eternal meant
in 1689 Sophia came up with the great
idea let's cram in to pose the two czars
to the nobility in the strokes either
had supported her this was a step too
far and she was sent away to a convent
for the rest of her life
this left both Ivan and Peter as joint
rulers but since Ivan was unable to rule
this made Peter the primary Tsar
although it was his mother who was
really in charge in 216 94 when she came
down with a case of the deads
two years later Ivan also tied meaning
that all of Russia was finally Peters
the first thing that Peter or Peter the
first did with his newfound freedom was
what all great Russian leaders would do
thereafter invade the Ottoman Empire
Russia was already at war with the
Ottomans as part of an alliance but
Peter made sure that there was a renewed
effort at taking southern territory they
saw Russia gained this territory as of
which importantly gave it access to the
see in the south so pita was a very
involved leader who took great pride in
personally overseeing government reforms
and projects for example in 1697 he
launched what is called the grand
embassy this was where his diplomats
traveled around Europe securing new
military technology and know-how as well
as strengthening the alliance against
the Ottoman Empire he traveled with this
embassy personally although for the most
of it he was in disguise he travelled to
many countries across Europe gaining
valuable information but had no luck
with fighting the Ottomans his grand
embassy had to be cut short when the
strokes he started to revolt in Moscow
this was put down before pita even
returned to Russia but afterwards all of
those involved was severely punished
Peter had a strong distaste for the
muscovite way of life ie he disliked
many of the old ways of doing things he
took on a more European Way of dress and
abandoned the forbids the previous
Russian leaders and the boyars had
sported you could opt not to but then
you'd have to pay a beard tax Peter
oversaw a simplification of the Russian
alphabet banned arranged marriages and
also changed the Russian calendar to the
julian 1 so whilst travelling across
Europe Peter had learned a great deal
about navies how they operate and how to
build them the problem for Peter was
that he needed access to a better coast
the Baltic one specifically one issue it
was controlled by the Swedish Empire
Peter thus made an alliance with Denmark
and Saxony his leader was also the ruler
of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth
against Sweden together they invaded and
so began the great northern war Denmark
near immediately withdrew from the war
allowing Sweden to turn east undeterred
Peter clash with the Swedish at the 1700
battle of Narva where he was completely
crushed by the better trained and
equipped Swedish forces Sweden hereafter
turned its attention to Saxony in the
Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth which
gave peat at the chance to regroup he
subsequently pushed into the lands of
ingria and Livonia and took this
territory to keep these territorial
gains Peter constructed a fort here and
founded a settlement in 1703 st.
Petersburg over the next four years
Sweden managed to stomp Saxony in the
Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth and in
1707 its army advanced into Russia like
so many others in history the invasion
was difficult because winter rolled
around and winter in Russia is very very
cold
Swedish forces retreated down south and
Peter followed where they clashed at the
Battle of Poltava here the Swedish army
was decisively beaten Charles the 12th
fled to the Ottoman Empire and his army
surrendered shortly afterwards
Peter demanded that the Ottomans hand
Charles over which they said no to and
so more war fortunately for Russia
Denmark and Poland Lithuania had
re-entered the
war unfortunately for Russia the Ottoman
army was incredibly formidable and
Peter's recent gains down south were
lost in 1711 the year after this defeat
Peter made a monumental decision he
moved the capital of the Sodom from
Moscow to st. Petersburg because again
he didn't care for the old ways even
though he was at war Peter still wish to
reform his kingdom but there were many
opponents to this reform not least was
his son an heir to the throne Alexis
Alexis had been raised by some boyars
many of whom resented Peters reforms and
he grew up to despise his father when in
1716 Peter wanted Alexis to join him on
campaign alexis fled to Austria which
made Peter look pretty bad in 1718
Alexis returned after his father had
agreed that he wouldn't be punished and
shortly after this Peter had Alexis
tortured to death for embarrassing him
Peter then changed the rules of
succession from my nearest relative gets
it to I get to pick who's next
beyond filicide Peter had introduced
widespread modernizing reforms in areas
like justice religion and of course the
military in terms of Justice Peter
banned lawyers from courtrooms because
and I'm not kidding here they talk too
much judges also weren't permitted to
make new rulings because in Peters
Russia only legislators could interpret
law and there was only one legislator
Peter as for the military Peter is often
seen as the founder of the Russian Navy
by 1720 Russia's Baltic Fleet was larger
than the entire Swedish Navy this was
quite impressive considering that in
1710 Russia didn't have a single naval
vessel in terms of religious reform
Peter decided in 1721 to abolish the
position of patriarch of Moscow and
replace it with the Holy Synod this was
basically a Council of men whom he could
bully into doing what he wanted 1721 was
a pretty big year for both Peter and
Russia first of all the great northern
war ended in a Russian victory so Russia
gained all of this territory having
control over this Russia's position in
Europe and that of Peter was much more
prestigious as such Peter decided that
his title of Tsar wasn't fancy enough
and he declared his no title to be
Imperato or Emperor and the Sodom of
Russia was now the Russian Empire in
1722 Peter created his table of ranks
whereby people's rank in society was
ideally no longer to be determined by
birth but now how useful they were they
saw many sons of boyars lose favor and
some new men ie nobly born people who
worked for the government rise up the
ranks Peter in 1723 also freed all of
the household slaves in Russia and made
them serfs Peter's transformative reign
would come to an end in 1725
he died and so it was time for his
appointed heir to take over oh wait he
didn't pick one and so decades of
succession disputes and turmoil which
culminated in Catherine the Great but
that's for another time
so Peter the Great's legacy is
undeniably important but also deeply
complex and controversial his reign
which only happened because the stars
align took Russia from being a kingdom
on the other side of the
polish-lithuanian Commonwealth to an
empire that nobody could ignore he laid
the foundations for Russia's rise to
great power status and deprived that
same status from Sweden he was
responsible for many sensible reforms
and modernized the Russian system of
government society religion and warfare
changed under his stewardship and so
it's no wonder that be seen as the
epitome of the enlightened despot one
who could bring Russia a great deal of
glory and ultimately someone who was
willing to kill his own son to protect
that glory I hope you enjoyed this

Ow! Who even hangs pots and pans from the ceiling? That is so dumb.
Just need to cut my sandwich in half- *slicing noise*

Ow! *grunts in pain*

Forget this stupid monster, the most dangerous thing in "Bird Box" is the second story...
Hello internet, welcome to Film Theory!
Forcefully opening your eyes to the mind-scarring truths hidden in all your favorite movies.
So Netflix has really is really hitting out of the park recently, isn't it?
Between the 'Choose your own adventure' movie "Bandersnatch", and the totally-not-"A Quiet Place"-rip-off "Bird Box",
there's been a lot of binge-able theory fodder coming out of the ol' *Netflix Sound DUN DUNH*
And while "Bandersnatch" might seem like the one that's more up my alley,
considering the video game theme and all that,
it's actually "Bird Box" that I wanna tackle first, mostly because the movie had one question that I think we all want answered:
what the heck was the monster?
To catch you up, "Bird Box" follows a group of people trying to survive a world wide catastrophe
in which people are driven to kill themselves after they witness some 'thing.'
In order to survive, you have to keep your eyes shut, or else wear a blindfold,
leading to this iconic imagery from the movie, and all these other really dumb "Bird Box" challenge videos on YouTube...
It's a really cool concept. Just like noise was the dangerous element from "A Quiet Place",
sight is the thing that gets you killed in "Bird Box".
But the frustrating thing about the movie is that you never actually get to see the monster.
It's never made explicitly clear what exactly is driving everyone to this point of madness.
So that is my goal today, to use all the clues that we see (and don't see) throughout the movie to rip off the
blindfold and expose the "Bird Box"
monster once and for all.
Let's look at what we know. From the opening moments it's made clear that when most people
see whatever it is that they're seeing,
they lose control and, within a few
seconds, look for the nearest garbage
truck to stand in front of, burning car
to hop into, or pane of glass to leap
through. But this effect isn't just
limited to in-person appearances. Greg,
in the highest stakes game of FNAF ever,
watches security cameras, sees the thing,
and immediately knocks his own block off.
It's important to note though that this isn't true for everyone.
About midway through the movie,
we learned from Gary that there are some
people who've seen it and don't
immediately off themselves.
"These psychos from Northwood..." "It's a mental institution for the criminally insane."
"They took us outside and they forced our
eyes open so that we would have to look
at the creatures." It seems like all these
people are either criminals or were
already insane prior to looking at the
thing. And rather than dying, they're
instead left to worship it, serving as
prophets trying to trick or force
everyone around them to open their eyes
and behold this thing of beauty.
So, beauty must be in the eyes of the
beholder since these are the images that
Gary draws of the thing after he's seen
it. The other reactions we get from
people who see the thing include:
and
It's not outright terror it's just more confusion. And lastly, we can deduce that whatever it is does have a physical form,
considering that we actively see it
casting shadows and setting off a car's
proximity sensors in an early scene, but
it also has limited ability to actually
interact with the world, considering it
can't open doors or pull off blindfolds
itself, instead relying on its devotees
to do the work for it. So that's a lot of
information, but where's that leave us?
Well, the movie gives us a list of
possible explanations to test in the
form of Charlie. "You got world religion,
mythology, it's full of mentions of
demons, or spirit creatures, that takes on
the form of your worst fears or deepest
sadness or your greatest loss." Except
we know that that isn't true of the "Bird
Box" creature, considering the early
responses of
and
Those responses don't scream "oh, this is
my greatest fear!" or "oh, this is the worst
loss I've ever experienced!" More just
like "oh, this is it huh?" So that one might
not have worked out, but don't worry, Charlie has a lot more hypotheses that
we can put to the test.
 
- mythology. All different names, but the
same thing: the end of us. Man Charlie,
I know it's the end of the world, and I
know this is all for your book but
you're even more melodramatic than I am.
Many of the entities you just mentioned
don't mean the end of us, plus you've
lumped together a lot of spiritual
things that are very different and all
very wrong for the situation that you're
currently in, so let's quickly knock 'em
off the list one by one. Aka Manah comes
from the Zoroastrian faith, one of the
oldest religions that are still in
practice today, with its origins in the
Middle East, and according to the
"Encyclopedia of Demons in World
Religions and Cultures", he's the
personification of sensual desire and
lust. He corrupts your morals and is said
to cause people to sit back and watch as
evil prevails. So if everyone in "Bird Box"
were busy getting their "woohoo" on in the
streets, then maybe he'd be the one at
work here, but clearly that's not the
case, and therefore he is clearly not our
demon. Surgat is another one that he
mentions that is also really easy to
eliminate. Coming out of the Christian
occult, he's known as 'the one who opens
all locks', which directly speaks to his
demonic power: the ability to open any
lock in the world. This makes him a
fantastic Mr. Beast to get possessed by
if you're clumsy with your keys, but
definitely not the culprit of a movie
where the entity that's killing everyone
is befuddled by a simple door handle.
Moving on, the Puca is an Irish
mythological creature that shape shifts
into different animals and plays pranks
on humans, like turning into a black
horse and taking people for a spooky
scary ride, but beyond that it doesn't
appear to be all that violent. Seeing it
certainly doesn't cause immediate death,
and there are plenty of stories where
the Puca actually gives good luck.
Another easy elimination, which leaves us
with the Chinese Huli-Jing, and
honestly this one seemed like a good fit...
at first. The Huli-Jing are nine-tailed
Chinese fox spirits with the ability to
shape shift,
often taking the form of a person's dead
relatives. They're able to make people
believe the opposite of what's true, like
a spirit who convinces you to take off
your blindfold and see them because
they're beautiful and they're immortal,
but that immortality requires them to
consume human souls. A lot of things
could really work here in the case of
"Bird Box." It seems like you can make a
solid case for 'em being our mystery entity,
except here's the rub:
they can pass through walls. Well, send
another possibility through the shredder.
So Charlie in the movie took a lot of shots
and missed 'em all. Maybe he should
abandon that writing project of his and
instead go back to his former job. Seems
like he had a lot more success there.
So now, it's my turn, and honestly, after
looking at all the various behaviors of
the "Bird Box" creature, no one explanation
can truly encapsulate it all. That said, I
do think that we can pinpoint the two
lores that have combined to create the
apocalypse that we see in "Bird Box." For
the first, let's look again at Gary's
pictures. At first glance, these just seem
to be a bunch of random spooky pictures,
but upon closer inspection you can
definitely see some key themes emerging.
First, the idea of exploding eyeballs,
which is his artistic representation of
the process of the pupil fracturing
every time someone sees these entities.
So with those pictures eliminated,
as well as the ones of just generally scary
or screaming faces, this is what we're
left with: a bunch of pictures of
monsters. Let's call them 'Horny', 'Tentacle
Face', and 'Elephant Nose.' Let's focus on
Tentacle Face here first. It looks a lot
like Davy Jones from the "Pirates of the
Caribbean", or it looks a lot like a
creature that one would describe like
this. Quote:
If you're familiar with your horror history,
you'll know that Tentacle Face belongs
to none other than the Lovecraftian
nightmare Cthulhu, a name that I'm sure
we're all vaguely familiar with but
might not know a whole lot about, so
let's take a minute to talk
about him. Cthulhu, created by author H. P. Lovecraft in his short story 'The Call of
Cthulhu', is what's known as a Great Old
One, a god-like entity that came from
space and now sleeps under the oceans of Earth, waiting to be awakened. But not
only does fish face fit what we see in
Gary's little art project, listen to how
the creator of "Bird Box" describes his
monster. "There's a teacher who mentioned
that a man would go mad, lose his mind, if
he were to attempt to fathom infinity...
...became like a monstrous concept to me,
all right. So, so at some point I started
to think of infinity or something the
human mind can't assimilate as a monster,
and what if that idea was actually, like,
personified? So, on your front porch
infinity is on the porch swing outside
swinging. Infinity is out there, and if
you opened the door..." Mind you, this
interview is from way back in 2015, from
the earliest days when his book started
to get attention, and long before the
author realized that he needed to be a
bit more mysterious in the way that he
talks about his story. So the monster, as
he saw it in his original novel, was
inspired by infinity. That's interesting,
considering that the main theme of the
Cthulhu mythos is human insignificance
when confronted with the idea
of infinity. Look no further than the
opening lines of 'Call of Cthulhu', which
outlines this exact premise. Quote:
End quote. Now, if that still doesn't sound
like it matches "Bird Box", just wait.
You see, in Lovecraftian stories, when
humans come into contact with one of
these infinite beings, like Cthulhu, they
go mad. Their brains aren't able to
comprehend the magnitude of what they're
seeing, and they literally go insane, but
it also doesn't apply to all humans.
A subset of people become worshipers of
the Old Ones just like we see in
"Bird Box". To quote from 'Call of Cthulhu':
And that's just Cthulhu.
Lovecraft has a whole series of monsters
in his bestiary that matched the other
drawings that we're seeing. Elephant Face? That's a lot like the design of Chaugner Faugn.
Horny? Definitely close to the
gods servants named Nightgaunts. So we
have creatures based on the concept of
infinity that have massive size, match
Gary's drawings, inspire cults of
devoted worshipers, and possess faces
that literally drive people insane. Monsters of the Cthulhu mythos match
practically all of our requirements.
Practically. You see, the Cthulhu
explanation misses a few major marks.
First, humans are to Cthulhu what insects
are to us: nothing. We can't be bothered.
He's too busy living his best life under
the sea alongside Aquaman and Ariel. That
would explain why it shows no interest
or urgency in opening doors in "Bird Box",
but Cthulhu also wouldn't be found
chasing around a few humans on a 42 hour boat tour. It's just a waste of his, and
quite frankly, most of the other
Lovecraftian monsters', time. The bigger
issue here though is the "Bird Box"
creature's ability to harness the
power of the dead. Up until this point, I've been dancing around one key issue here:
the fact that the entity can mimic the
appearance and voice of family members.
And not just people it was responsible
for killing either. In the opening
moments of the movie, we meet, and quickly lose, a woman named Lydia. As she sees the
monster, she calls out:
The twist is that Lydia's mom has been
dead for five years, long before this
thing started attacking Earth. The movie
doesn't bother to explore this, but to me
this is a huge detail that's critical
for understanding the lore behind this
thing. It's also critical to know that
it's not restrained to mimicking just
the dead. In an effort to trick boy and
girl into removing their blindfolds,
the entity mimics the voice of Mallory, our protagonist, who is still very much alive.
So what's happening here? But
before I tell you the other half of this
theory, do me a favor and remove those blindfolds for just long enough to hit

other cool horror movie theories headed

Thank you so much. And now, with that out
of the way, let's finish this mystery up.
While a Cthulhu-like monster seems to be
the physical being that people are
seeing here, where are these additional
powers and motivations coming from? Well, there's strong evidence to suggest that
these elements are inspired by The
Rapture, the event in some Christian
belief where the faithful, both living
and dead, are taken up to meet Christ.
To use the original Bible verses, 1st Thessalonians chapter 4, verses 16 and 17, quote:
Consider this: what if Lydia, calling out
to her mom, is actually seeing her dead
mother in the afterlife? And if Tom
really is calling out to Mallory at the
end of the movie, encouraging her to open
her eyes and join him in the afterlife?
All of these souls seem to be caught up
together, just like in The Rapture, where
they would be encouraging others below them to join. If that was truly the
case, and you have all these worthy dead
people mixed up together like a big ol'
yarn ball, it would be a beautiful sight,
just like those left behind say that it
is despite their drawings suggesting
otherwise. Speaking of those left behind,
why are only criminals left behind on
Earth? Well, because they didn't honor
God's commandments and don't merit going up to heaven. They're not rapture
material, you could say. And not only does
it explain that, but this theory also
gives clarity to a detail that's easy to
overlook: why these delusional prophets
insist on opening the eyes of their
victims instead of, you know, just killing
'em. I mean, if the monster truly wanted
these people to just kill off the rest
of humanity, why wouldn't they just do it?
Why resort to forcing their eyes open?
It's so the victims can bear witness. In
the Christian faith, a lot of emphasis is
put on bearing witness to God's power.
Isaiah 43, verse 10:
Even Gary seems remorseful that he kills
off Douglas without him getting to SEE
the entity.
"Sorry that you didn't get to see. It is beautiful. So beautiful..."
How about the whole 'not opening doors' thing? Revelation 3:20:
and I hear you, I totally
recognize the concern too - what about
everyone taking their own lives? If this
is a Rapture situation, isn't that a
cardinal sin of the church? Yeah, yeah it
is. Absolutely. However, this is possibly a
Rapture-like situation we're talking
about. Maybe Rapture rules are in
effect. I mean, think about it.
Typical depictions of the event are a
bunch of bodies just kind of rising up
to the heavens, but that doesn't really
make a whole lot of sense, does it? Maybe
the real rapture is just those who are
chosen answering the call to free their
spirits by abandoning the flesh, and
doing stuff like garbage truck hopping
is the fastest way to do it. You may have
also noticed the odd motif of pregnancy.
You see it with Mallory. You see it with
Olympia. Is it a coincidence then, that when
referring to the day of Rapture, the
Bible specifically refers to it coming
on like labor pains to a pregnant woman?
1st Thessalonians, chapter 1:
It's a weird coincidence, right? Now obviously, there's an elephant
in the room: why would the blind be left
behind during a rapture scenario? And
yeah, the meek shall inherit the earth. I dunno, not a perfect theory. Like I said earlier,
I don't think it's any one monster or
one religious belief happening here.
A rapturing Cthulhu - a literal octopus
Jesus - is really the closest we can
probably get. There's just a lot of weird
specifications that this thing needs to
fill, and in the end it's really more
like an original creation for the
purposes of the story, which, gotta
say, is never a bad thing.
What? People coming up with an original
thought for a change? Go figure. And heck,
at the very least my explanation of an
octopus Jesus today is way better than
what they were gonna put in the movie.
Yeah, that veiny reptile baby was an
early version of the monster that got
cut. I got to admit, for as frustrating
as not seeing the monster was, not seeing
the monster was a whole heck of a lot
better than that. But hey, that's just a
theory. A Film Theory! Aaaand if you want to
see more horrific Film Theory action,
click the box on the right to see how to
beat Michael Myers. Or, if you want to see
something that's a bit closer to home,
check out our series on Salad Fingers.
It's the creepiest animated thing that
you're gonna see today. Now if you'll
excuse me, I have a few more endings that
I gotta get in "Bandersnatch". I'll see
you next week.

[Music]
hello internet welcome to film theory
the show that's contractually obligated
to never sleep again thankfully i know
just the thing to help with that the
mandela catalog a terrifying series of
six videos here on youtube that are
guaranteed to give you nightmare fuel
for weeks produced by alex kister the
mandela catalog is the latest and
greatest example from the increasingly
popular world of analog horror think
local 58 gemini home entertainment the
walton files apparently there was just
something about the 1980s that was
utterly terrifying
oh no those shoulder pads there they're
so big
is that thing a cell phone or a brick
kill it kill it with fire
ex-president ronald reagan no no get
back get back i can't handle your
trickle-down economics anyway all joking
aside the mandela catalog tells its
terrifying tale through a series of
1980s and 90s era vhs tapes all
originating in the mysterious mandela
county where children have started to go
missing and a mysterious intruder is
breaking into local homes but what
begins as a few simple home videos
quickly descends into a tale of
kidnapping body swapping religious
conspiracy and metaphysics this one is
gonna get dark friends so buckle up
while we try to crack open the unholy
horrors that exist inside the mandela
catalog
it's hard to say exactly where we should
start this series considering the first
posted video isn't the one that the
creator suggests watching first but this
upload overthrown does set up our key
theme so i think starting here still
makes the most sense in it we're
presented with an animated version of
the birth of jesus coming specifically
from a video series called the
beginner's bible and yeah it gives you
the classic tale of an angel gabriel
descending from heaven to tell mary that
she'll be giving birth to the savior
jesus christ who'll bless us with love
and joy and amazing black friday deals
for everyone on our christmas list ah it
is so nice to remember the reason for
the season except this time the nativity
story is just a little bit different our
angel's name is redacted and his face
has been censored for a brief moment
though we glimpse behind the sensor bar
to see this what looks to be a blue
alien rips straight out of james
cameron's avatar as he speaks he
glitches on the word angel
i am the
angel gabriel already you can tell that
something is going wrong here a
suspicion that only grows once gabriel
starts speaking in binary
[Music]
apparently the angels we have heard on
high are very proficient with their ones
and zeros turning on closed captions we
see that whispers translate to a code
that reads i am the one true savior i
must reverse the delusion joseph is next
and indeed joseph stepfather of jesus is
next as he sleeps the angel speaks to
fear him this is like the worst asmr
video lastly we see the shepherds in the
field meeting our angel who once again
declares himself to be the one true
savior
smash cut to black before we get red
text saying i deceived them such weak
minds yep we're in that part of youtube
again friends sweet dreams everyone
alright but let's get a grip on
everything that we're seeing here first
whatever this thing is it ain't an angel
notice that only after it says i know
everything about what makes you human
does it reveal a human face this thing
is a shape shifter and its true form is
what we saw at the beginning before the
sensor bar went up that weird blue alien
face notice too that it stumbles over
the word angel getting stuck on the
letter a almost as though it was trying
to say i am the alien and then
correcting itself to me this whole thing
is very reminiscent of the ancient
aliens theory the idea that some
intelligent extraterrestrials visited
earth in the prehistoric days and in the
process spawned all human conceptions of
gods and religions as humans were unable
to comprehend what they had just
witnessed but let me be perfectly clear
here i'm not married to that theory
there's also plenty of evidence to
suggest that this angel is in fact the
devil himself satan again with closed
captions turned on we get a special
secret while the screen's black hidden
in the closed captions is this message
quote how frozen i became and powerless
then ask it not reader for i write it
not because all language would be
insufficient i did not die and i alive
remained not think for thyself now hast
thou ought of wit this quote well poetic
is actually a direct excerpt from a
classic work of literature called
dante's inferno specifically a part near
the end of kanto 34. for those who don't
know dante's inferno is basically just a
dude's trip through the various circles
of h-e-double toothpicks and this quote
is coming from the end of his tour when
dante's in the frozen center of it all
and there he encounters satan himself
chewing on some sinners in fact this
line is his reaction to seeing the giant
behemoth that is satan and he's not just
chewing on any sinners he's chewing on
some liars and frauds judas who lied to
and betrayed jesus as well as brutus and
cassius the two men who betrayed and
murdered julius caesar so we see that
fraud is the biggest sin as defined by
the inferno the same type of fraud that
we see our angel committing to marry
joseph and the shepherds in the mandela
catalog could our angel then potentially
be satan himself it seems likely in the
final upload of season one titled
exhibition we get another hidden quote
in the closed captions this time a bible
verse corinthians 11 14. isn't it
obvious that it's disgraceful for a man
to have long hair oh wait sorry sorry
wrong corinthians that's one corinthians
not two corinthians sorry but cheese
bible really pushing everyone to get
their sick fate on huh anyway after a
long section talking about whether girls
can pray with their heads uncovered or
whether they just need to shave off
their hair here's the right quote for
you and no wonder for satan disguises
himself as an angel of light i mean that
right there seems pretty explicit and
just to hammer the point home in another
video warning about how people in this
universe are losing their minds to a
disorder called mad we're told to quote
avoid religious practices which again
seems like this is a world where satan
or that blue avatar alien take your pick
has misled the masses and has seized
control of the world's religions
manipulating their minds and causing
them to go crazy so it would seem that
satan has come to deceive the world but
why is he waiting all the way until the
80s to do anything with that and what
exactly is his plan well either satan's
a big fan of bon jovi or it has
something to do with the analog part of
analog horror the television you see the
80s was perhaps the golden age
television it was when cable became
popular suddenly instead of three
channels you had dozens it was when the
video cassette recorder allowed viewers
to tape their favorite shows it was when
the tv remote allowed people to veg out
on the couch and just surf in short the
tv rose to prominence during this decade
and with it the ability to reach the
masses almost anytime anywhere something
that a fake brainwashing angel would
probably love to exploit in the final
upload of season 1 we see that the
government has issued something called
the television and mirror destruction
order saying that if a loved one is
coming to contact with one of these
items you have to contact the local
authorities right away in other words
tvs are dangerous in this universe and
also
mirrors so let's reflect on that one
thing that keeps getting brought up in
the mandela catalog is fear gabriel
talks about how he desires to know the
fear of joseph and the shepherds in
another video a training tape for
emergency responders they're expressly
told to not talk to victims on the phone
because you might accidentally reveal
your fear there's something absolutely
chilling when you see an emergency
services training video telling the only
people who can help in a dire situation
to cower in fear and let the innocents
die and in yet another video we see an
emergency alert about an onslaught of
missing children that warns parents to
keep their kids away from televisions
because they might project frightening
imagery it would seem then that some
entity satan or whoever is using the tvs
to broadcast fears into people's minds
and into their homes this again seems to
coincide with the 1980s setting for this
thing and specifically the birth of the
24-hour news cycle in 1980 the cable
channel cnn launched and in the process
pioneered news as round-the-clock
programming suddenly it wasn't just a
short one hour update at the end of each
night it was instead like sports live
and updating with all the latest and all
the worst headlines that humanity had to
offer at any hour of any day a trend
that is only accelerated with the
internet and things like twitter now
obviously i'm just making an analogy
here a comparison to what's going on in
the series but it does seem like
something that's happening here in the
mandela catalog in the season one finale
we get a series of home videos by a
young man named mark heathcliff he's
important for a lot of other reasons
that we'll talk about later throughout
his tapes though nothing much happens
some church imagery a door mysteriously
opening and closing in the dark but then
we see this
a figure approaching him through a tv at
night we get this assessment from the
cops that are looking at the footage
quote heathcliff has been paranoid for a
prolonged period to me it seems to
suggest that the tv was the thing that
was causing his paranoia whether
literally summing a shadow monster to
taunt him or else symbolically causing
him to succumb to his darkest fears in
fact the tv does appear to offer a
physical portal in people's homes upload
number four intruder alert shows us this
man who is more than happy to whisper to
us
well uh that's a comforting thought can
you feed the cat while you're in there
also notice the whispered voice sounds a
lot like our angel friend anyway
throughout this video we see him
repeatedly appearing in televisions
which would be scary on its own and it
is but he also appears to be stealing
children out of their beds midway
through the video we get a psa about the
importance of taking care of your
children the psa presents us with a
crying baby who when checked on by his
mommy has vanished out of its crib the
only person that was in the room the tv
intruder and we know that he can get
into and out of the house presumably
through the tv as we see later in the
same video our intruder roaming the
house of the vanished child hidden in
the shadows we're told that
3426 children have gone missing over the
past several weeks so it looks like our
dude here has been pretty darn busy why
what's he doing with all these children
and how is he doing it is it just sci-fi
can he just teleport between tv screens
well yeah it kind of seems like that the
video tells us that quote they exist on
different spectrums suggesting that this
person this intruder may have the
ability to appear and disappear from
different spectra perhaps one that
allows him to physically be broadcast
into a home or at the very least exist
on a different plane of reality and
appear and disappear at will as we see
in the short mad disorder video an
entity is invisible it fades in to tell
its victim something and then it fades
away as if it were phasing in and out of
reality and if this intruder is in some
way related to the satan angel or is
himself satan then the ability to do
that to appear and disappear at will
isn't all that far-fetched which brings
us to what's actually getting whispered
here in the mad disorder video we're
told that whatever's being said it
drives the victim insane causing them to
in 97 of cases end their own life but
what information is actually being
spread here what is prompting all this
fear well the title of the video in this
case might be our biggest clue mad in
the context of the mandela catalog is
short for something called metaphysical
awareness disorder though we're never
told what this thing is only the deadly
end results of what coming down with it
entails based on the words alone i think
we can get a pretty solid guess as to
what it means metaphysics is all about
the nature of reality what exists how
does it exist basically a subject that
is beyond our physical world and basic
five senses and the word awareness is
just that you're suddenly made aware of
something so what we have here is that
this intruder or these otherworldly
beings are telling their targets the
nature of reality or maybe a lie about
it which in turn causes the victim to
lose their mind and ultimately end their
own life actually very reminiscent of
the opening lines of h.p lovecraft's
call of cthulhu which is also about
reality our existence and how we can
never truly comprehend the nature of
that existence quote the most merciful
thing in the world i think is the
inability of the human mind to correlate
all its contents we live on a placid
island of ignorance in the midst of
black seas of infinity and it was not
meant that we should voyage far the
sciences each draining in its own
direction have hitherto harmed us little
but someday the piecing together of
dissociated knowledge will open up such
terrifying vistas of reality and of our
frightful position therein that we shall
either go mad from the revelation or
flee from the light into the peace and
safety of a new dark age in short this
is what i think's going on with the mad
disorder in mandela catalog other
worldly beings telling people about
their place in reality and us humans are
just unable to comprehend it which leads
to a sudden and tragic end of our lives
as the video says only three percent are
able to be cured of this and if these
quote unquote angels are indeed some
sort of demon or alien well those are
the exact type of creatures that would
be able to speak on something like the
subject of reality so in summary we have
ourselves satan or some alien but
probably satan disguising himself as a
human to shape the world's religions
he's spreading fear via the newest and
hottest technology of the 80s television
and also spreading words about the true
nature of reality in order to crush the
lies of anyone he tells meanwhile we
have another intruder which may or may
not be the same character using the
spectrum of television to enter homes
and steal away thousands of children
talk about your feel-good horror stories
for the holiday season and i'm not even
done there's still a lot more to this
story in the form of alternates
unstoppable mutant doppelgangers as well
as a mysterious society that's trying to
piece things all back together with the
help of a dead man and here's the twist
friends this guy may not be as evil as
he first appears but all that and more
on the next installment because let me
tell ya there's a lot to cover here so

Taylor Swift surprised fans Thursday
with a brand new song only the young is
her new political anthem she dropped
with the release of her Netflix
documentary and joining us now with a
breakdown of all the truth bombs Taylor
dropped and missed Americana is easy on
lines Katy crass and one of Taylor's
biggest fan that is a true statement I
want to get right into it we have pulled
some of the best clips from the
documentary but I just want to say this
documentary if you love Taylor if you
don't like Taylor you should watch this
it really demonstrates what she's gone
to over the past decade right to really
find herself and her voice and I think
that this quote from the documentary
kind of sums the whole thing up so take
a look one of love glitter and also
stand up for the double standards that
exist in our society I want to wear pink
and tell you how I feel about politics
and I don't think that those things have
to cancel each other out I want to still
have a sharp pen
thin skin and an open heart Wow I love
it you're lying it's a documentary
that's so fascinating cuz you really get
a behind-the-scenes look not just had a
creative process of creating music with
her thought process of where she stands
now in the world kind of her life and
what she's gone through I think one of
the biggest things in there if she does
address Kanye West and what happened in
2009 at the VMAs but she's not throwing
daggers she's not accusing she's keeping
it classy and she's explaining how that
moment made her feel and I want you guys
to check this out for someone who's
built their whole belief system on
getting people to clap for you the whole
crowd booing is a pretty formative
experience that was like sort of a
catalyst for a lot of psychological
paths that I went down
[Music]
not all of them were beneficial she gets
really deep here yeah and that is one of
the biggest themes that we that we see
throughout is how much she got like she
loved the approval right and she loved
his fans and she really measured her
success on how people thought of her and
she does talk about the success of 1989
and winning that Grammy for album of the
year for the second time and how when
you hit the top and you think you have
it all maybe you don't really and it
feels so lonely it feels so lonely yeah
take a look at this clip and I remember
thinking afterward oh my god that was
all you wanted oh god that was all you
wanted that was all you focused on you
get to the mountaintop and you look
around and you're like oh god what now I
want to thank the fans for the last 10
years
I didn't have a partner that I climbed
it with that I could like high-five plot
twist look now she does have a partner
to share all of this with she manifests
anymore well I think with that she kind
of thought to herself I do need a
prioritize life differently right like I
do need a focus I think life is a pie
right and you can't just make it all
career you have to have those moments
for your personal life and I think she
said to herself I don't want to go
through this alone how much of Joe all
when do we see in this documentary so
there's not a time but there is a moment
when she comes off stage and he's back
there and she kind of runs into his arms
there's also a moment where you see and
I think we can actually pull this up for
you guys what fans think an engagement
ring - there it is on that thing it's on
the cat ring again it does look like the
cat ring and I do remember cat yeah but
I see why fans are talking so much about
that moment anything on that finger is
she does talk about Joe a little bit
though and if you'll remember after her
and Kanye kind of went at it again after
the VMAs in just a few years ago when he
released famous there with some beef and
she talked about how Joe kind of came
into her life at that moment and what
that was like for her so take a look I
have to deconstruct an entire belief
system for my own personal sanity I also
was falling in love with someone who had
a really wonderfully normal balanced
grounded life
and we decided together that we wanted
our relationship to be private even
though it was really horrible I was
happy but I wasn't happy in the way that
I'd been trained to be happy it was
happiness without anyone elses input it
was just as we were happy and I feel
like that really is probably the most
we're gonna get out of her yeah this
relationship because like she said they
want to keep it private and I respect
that and again she's here saying that
this is a different kind of happiness
for her right it's another point to that
theme where she's got all of her
happiness and all of her assurances from
how people viewed her and here she's
saying this is different like I don't
need people to like my relationship I
this is a completely new feeling for her
and even though that's as much as we got
on Joe and her boyfriend she did reveal
that she's not quite right that was also
pretty candid for me yeah and there is
one conversation in there where she
actually is talking to her best friend
abigail they've been friends forever
good and they're talking about their
other friend Claire who did just have a
baby and Taylor talks about the cycle of
you feed them and you love them and then
you sleep and then you wake up and then
you change them and you feed them and
you do it again and she kind of compared
it to having a tamagotchi which is
really fine spent too much time on any
one topic when I was watching
documentary walk us through a couple of
the other kind of truths that we learned
yeah so one of my favorite things about
this is the glimpse that we get into her
relationship with her mom Andrea who we
know has had or is going through quite
the difficult cancer battle and just to
see how it's really affected the family
and how it's changed Taylor's
perspective take a look at this clip you
guys it woke me up from this is life
where I used to sweat all these things
but like do you really care if the
internet doesn't like you today if your
mom's sick from her chemo obviously very
emotional yeah and a lot of tears in
this you know when you see how much
Andrea is with Taylor through everything
it was actually a moment where Taylor's
gone through so much negativity and
backlash and her mom breaks down
actually saying this to her so take a
look at this one
it's okay now a lot of yeah a lot of
really sweet mother-daughter moments
here we also see Taylor getting really
emotional she's really vulnerable in
this you guys and take a look at this
moment where she breaks down over the
Taylor Swift is over party hashtag that
happened a few years back and remember
we do remember that um take a look I've
been doing this for 15 years as I'm
tired of it I'm just tired of the
just
just feels like it's more than music now
at this point oh man that's gotta be
hard for an artist to write it's like
you spend your whole life writing these
songs maybe wanting to connect and then
you feel like it's not about the music
anymore it's all about the tabloids in
the rumors and the stories and the few
and you're a human you are a human at
the end of the day and that's why she
said she kind of retreated for a little
bit no and she created all this work but
also she creeped she worked on herself
though too and that's when she really
got political and found her of ways
right you know what
yeah that but also I mean through I mean
we do see that in this documentary
there's a lot of that we played some of
the song earlier there is a portion
though she does talk about her eating
disorder which I think may be the most
vulnerable that Taylor has ever gotten
the most she's really shared about kind
of struggles she went through
take a look yeah you don't ever say to
yourself look I've got an eating
disorder but you know you're like making
a list of everything you put in your
mouth that day and you know that's
probably not right I'm a lot happier
with Who I am and I'm happier with like
I don't I don't care as much if like
somebody points out that I have gained
weight it's just something that makes my
life better the fact that I'm
I'm a size six instead of a size double
zero I mean a lot of things that people
may not have known about her in this
document and I think after they watch
that they're just gonna look at her in a
different way and like you see how many
people on her team were trying to
influence her and telling her what to
speak out about what not to say I came
into play with a whole political thing
her own dad yeah did not want her to
post that first Instagram statement
where she really talked about politics
for the first time in fact those
candidates in Tennessee who are
Democrats
it was pretty heated take a look at this
though they told her they're like you're
gonna have backlash the president is
gonna come after you verse one she
literally did not care I don't care what
they write that I'm sad that I didn't
two years ago the president could come
after you yes bad I don't care she you
know what ain't good for her good for
her that she's using her platform to
speak out for what she wants and set
that precedent and again I mean we
really see how she came to find her
voice and how it was really hard I think
for women in country music to speak out
on what they believe and to have a voice
and not just to be what she calls like a
good little girl girl like like you
mentioned whether you're a Taylor Swift
fan or not you will see her a difference
see her in a different light and I
really recommend it actually miss
Americana is streaming now on that thank
you thanks guys
[Music]

and I now begin to compare myself to I
see that
ah history will tells about my trial and
and
persecution what you Nigeria you have
done to me is terrible
[Music]
try it's terrible the most persecuted
Pastor not only that there
nothing I have not gone through in this
country and I now begin to cont myself
to I see
that this is more like TB
Joshua replying Nigerians from the grave
terrible TI Joshua even ped this
persecution even before he died this
video he made it before he left not only
that he said there's nothing I just have
not done to him this video will make you
emotional please watch the full video by
30 year as a prophet Ministers of
God because of what you people have been
doing to me have
graduated look at the the crowd in the
CH if you gather this crowd today all of
us here together hardly we will see one
or two people
that have not once upon a time rebuked
me banned me that
man bur he
rebuked hardly we see 1 2 3 4 5 out of
this crowd that have never have not once
upon a
time but the story have
changed because of that when I'm in your
mid ah God will say remember your
people say okay your people God call you
people my people say my people my people
that is the name God call
you and you know the mean of the my
people when they say my people my people
my people say my people my people my
people my
people so when I want to deliver Mage I
I talk to you in
Parable what what does he cost to tell
you the exact what is going to happen
but if I said
it oh I learned my lesson from the the
game Africa Cup when Nigeria wanted to
play the the the game and I said to
Nigeria here you are going to
lose this is a game I'm saying you're
going to lose and the game was two weeks
ahead the whole television in Nigeria
they turn it on me they be me up they
say if if we if if we if we win the game
we will come to snagle we make sure we
put fire you destroy the church H
humilation was so
much
now a lot of thing I've seen if I say
the protection of God is so much in me
what of
you you that are always with me I you
consider your own protection too
ah you know we that wasn't in the P we
used to do
diging you see the opposite side there
we bought almost four
Transformer each V they will form the
Transformer and they cannot when they
cannot enter chur to come and do that
they will bump the
Transformer there's
nothing so the message was given to me
what is happen and what is happened
there and what will happen next
by me God has shown me everything but I
say God give me a parable I will talk to
this people in Parable because they have
different channel for TV Joshua now may
be
this in I
say it's very important to discover
yourself what I'm talking about is our
destiny
if I'm not operate on my destiny if if
I'm not given the spiritual gift to
operate what I'm going through what I've
been going through in the past is enough
to send me
part there's nothing I look at the
Apostle in the Bible I look at the trial
and Temptation they went through and I
now begin to compare myself to I see
that
ah history who tells about my trial and
and
persecution what Nigeria you have done
to me is
[Music]
terrible it's terrible the most persed
Pastor not only that there
nothing I have not gone through in this
[Music]
country so there need for you to to know
your calling if you don't know your
calling and you are operating whatever
you become it does not take this people
a second to bring you
down if you not operate on your calling
your calling is your

TP Joshua replying from the
glaive
hey this man saw all these things coming
I took my time to watch that BBC
documentary if you don't get M no watch
them if your mind canot carry it no
watch them you know get what I know here
you know get I don't even know what to
believe
again I just need to leave this
country I don't know what to believe
again I don't know what to believe again
people that were saying that why are
there trying to drag a man that cannot
defend himself there is one woman that
woman that her eyes is uh somehow mhm
that woman has been talking about these
things since
2019 even there was a time that it
landed at ew they were selling
the CD plate so they've been talking
about all these things so no today they
talk about them in short according to
documentary it was few days after they
started it that t died so they started
when he was
alive now T Joshua this video Pro that t
Joshua say he saw all these things
coming my
brother let me leave you to your own
opinion no me tell you what you do I'm
not your
creator
byebye

well you know we talked to a lot of
people for uh my film what is a woman
which is streaming now exclusively on
the daily wire and you go to
wonderswoman.com and get signed up and
you can watch the film right now many of
the conversations we had were
unintentionally hilarious many were
disturbing veering significantly over to
the disturbing end of the spectrum is my
interview with dr michelle
forcier who is as you'll hear her
proudly identify herself a gender
affirming pediatrician also an
abortionist uh we flew up to
providence rhode island uh to speak with
dr forcier she was
you know friendly enough at first and
what we found in many of the interviews
that you'll see in what is a woman is
that gender ideologues are very polite
and nice
right up until the moment when you
express any skepticism
at all but before we get to that point
um where things really start to sort of
fall apart let's get to know michelle a
little bit watch
my name is michelle forcier
and i have a medical degree from
university of connecticut residency
university of utah pediatrics and i've
worked for a number of different planned
parenthoods for 20 years i do advanced
contraception and abortion as well as
gender hormones and sort of looking at
the whole sort of schema of gender sex
and reproductive
justice so you've done a lot of work in
this field could you just start by
telling us sure at what age can a child
first
begin to
transition into another gender or
identify themselves as
a gender different from how they were
born yeah well i mean there's there's
research and data that show that um
babies and infants um understand
differences in gender
some children
figure out their gender
really early
and the reason why we are say oh that's
that's interesting or important is
because they're figuring out their
gender identity is not necessarily
congruent with their sex assigned at
birth when the when the doctor sees the
penis and says this is a male
has a sex of male that's a arbitrary
distinction
telling that family based on that little
penis
that your child is absolutely a hundred
percent male identified no matter what
else occurs in their life
that's not correct
so what is gender affirmation care
you're a big proponent of if we walk
through a child
who's sitting down with you is
questioning yeah their gender what's the
gender affirmation process
affirmation means that as a pediatrician
as someone who says my job is to provide
the best medical care for you
is i need to listen really carefully and
how i put it in words for kids so that
they can understand it is tell me your
story where have you been in terms of
your gender and your gender identity
where are you right now
and more excitingly where would you like
to be in the future
have you ever met a four-year-old
who believes in santa claus
says to someone who believes that
a fat man is traveling through the sky
and a flying reindeer at lightning speed
coming down his chimney with presence
yeah
would you say that this is someone who
maybe has a tenuous grasp on reality
they have an appropriate four-year-old
handle on the reality that's very real
for them agreed i agree but santa claus
is real for them but yeah santa claus is
not actually real yeah well but santa
claus does deliver their christmas
presents
well yeah but he's not real though
to that child they are
when i see a child who you know believes
in santa claus and then let's say this
is a boy and he says i'm a girl
this is someone who can't distinguish
between fantasy and reality so
how could you take that
as a reality
i would say that as a pediatrician and
as a parent
i would say how wonderful my
four-year-old and their imagination is
you know one of the hardest things as we
did this film uh especially in
interviewing somebody
like that
is uh not like my instincts just to yell
at them to begin with
but
that's not what the
it's kind of a short film if it's just
me going around yelling at people the
objective here is to ask
questions and that's and that's uh all
we did to the whole film is just is just
uh is ask questions
and let gender ideology essentially hang
itself as the idea
and uh and and to show is this something
that can withstand
scrutiny or not
even just basic scrutiny and what we
discovered is that it can't so what's
happening in that exchange
is first of all she says uh talking
about a child who sits down with her
is she wants to know about their gender
journey and where would you like to be
in the future so she's talking about a
child's like five-year gender plan
but the point i was trying to get across
to her is that
children
don't have a grasp on reality i mean
even if in theory people could choose
their own gender
which they can't but if they could
it wouldn't make sense to say that a
child could choose it
children believe in santa claus
so like what do they know about reality
if if a child is four years old and
believes that not only santa claus is
real but that fairies and dragons and it
lives appropriately in this kind of
fantasy world
and then the boy says that i'm a girl
that claim
exists within the same fantasy world
this is just imagination this is a kid
who just doesn't it doesn't understand
the distinction we fancy in reality
um so how can they make these
determinations but then again as we as
found there michelle wouldn't even
affirm that santa doesn't exist so that
was i was unclear about that also like
are you
do you actually think that santa exists
what's happening but it's it's
as you're talking to these people it's
like your own you feel yourself going
slightly insane
so it was a pretty bewildering exchange
there but it only gets weirder from here
let's keep watching male gametes that's
what makes me male no your your sperm
don't make you male then what does
it's a constellation
in reality
in truth okay whose truth are we talking
about the same truth that says we're
sitting in this room right now you and i
no
you're not listening if i if i see a
chicken laying eggs and i say that's a
female chicken laying eggs did i assign
female or am i just observing a physical
reality that's happening in the world
does a chicken have gender identity does
a chicken cry
does a chicken commit suicide
let's say
because you're talking you're trying
chicken has sex like any like any
biological organisms an assigned gender
but a chicken doesn't have a gender
identity so we assign female to chickens
when they lay eggs we assume they're
female if they lay eggs that right there
will uh go down for me as
maybe one of the most probably
and every other thing make that makes it
on this particular list is also happened
in the film but certainly one of the
most outrageous
uh
exchanges i've ever had with anybody
and of course see this this is what
happens when you start asking questions
to to the to the gender to the proponent
of gender ideology
is um they you know they start
they end up backing themselves into
various corners and they have to
make
um increasingly more wild sort of claims
to get themselves out of the corners
that they've backed themselves into
and so when you're talking about sex for
example
like it's all on a spectrum
and uh sex is something that is as she
says in in our conversation she says
that sex is a assigned at birth
that just like doctors are just deciding
this kind of arbitrarily
well if that's the nature of
sex then what about other organisms
aside from human beings okay we would
also say that when a chicken is laying
eggs oh well that's a female chicken are
we assigning that is that is that is
that just something we've decided that
the chicken is female
or is the chicken female and if the
chicken is female
then that would tell us something about
the nature of biological sex which is
that it's not assigned it is observed
but she can't go along with that and so
she starts talking about the chicken's
gender identity and whether chickens
commit suicide
and it doesn't get much better from
there well last week kim kardashian
announced her new role as chief taste
consultant for beyond meat an
alternative meat maker according to a
bloomberg report this is a last-ditch
effort for the company's survival having
seen an 80 plunge in shares of the last
12 months they say quote kim's ability
to raise a company's profile would be
welcome for beyond meat which is working
to tame waning consumer curiosity about
its products i should have to say this
but i will um fake meat is gross and
eating fake meat is not going to save
the environment also it's a fitting that
a fake meat company would make the
fakest person on the planet their chief
taste consultant so there's a little bit
of
some symmetry and poetry there i don't
like fake things i like the real deal
that's why i've officially declared
myself the unofficial
chief taste consultant for good ranchers
the meat company that delivers only 100
real american meat and for my first act
as chief taste consultant i want to tell
you about good rancher's latest
promotion right now when you go to
goodranchers.com walsh news codewalsh
you'll get two 18 ounce prime center cut
rib eyes free with your order that's a
100 value for free that's promo code
walsh at goodranchers.com
walsh this is a deal you don't want to
pass up don't support crazy people and
their fake me buy from good ranchers
instead
at what age does the medical transition
begin with uh medication so medical
affirmation begins when the patient says
they're ready for it so that could be
a kiddo who is just starting puberty
and panicking because they're getting
breast buds or their penis is getting
bigger and busier and they're worried
about all kinds of masculine changes and
that way puberty blockers which are
completely reversible
and don't have permanent effects are
wonderful because we can put that pause
on puberty just like if you were
listening to music you put the pause on
and we stop the blockers and puberty
would go right
back to where it was the next note in
the song
just delayed that period of time so this
part is apart from later in the film as
we start getting into more of the
specifics here about puberty blockers
and i'm not going to say myself right
now a lot in response to that because
you have to go watch the film
um because as i said we i'm asking
questions and we don't just ask
questions of people on this side we
bring in other people
so there's a there's a little bit of a
back and forth here but
we're gonna get a response in the film
to this claim that puberty can just be
just be you know just pause it as she
says like like music
does the human body
work that way
i mean is is that the way it works
where you can take a drug
to intentionally
um interfere with certain normal healthy
processes and you could take and then
there's there's
no negative consequences at all
just stop taking the drug and pick up
where you left off
which of course the interesting thing is
that even if that was true which it
isn't as you'll see in the film
but even if it was true well then
wouldn't that mean i mean
if a child's taking puberty blockers
to stop their normal development and
then we're just putting it on pause for
let's say five years
and then they decide that okay i don't
want to take this anymore well at a
minimum now they're going to be five
years behind in their growth and
development so even according to
her version of events
like at a minimum you're going to have
stunted growth
and you're gonna have someone who is
behind in their physical development but
actually the consequences are a lot
worse than that
as we uh discover in the film and as we
get into um in this next exchange about
the puberty blockers themselves what are
they
what do they do
uh what is their what is their actual
purpose
uh let's watch that one of the drugs
used as lupron right which
has actually been used to
chemically castrate sex offenders you
know what
i'm not sure that we should continue
with this interview because it seems
like it's going in a particular
direction well you're a medical
professional i am a medical professional
so you don't want to talk about
the drugs that you give to kids or
again
i'm a physician and i use medication
you're choosing exploitive words
drugs i give you i'm choosing a chemical
guys word that was in a dictionary
that's not a correct term for puberty
blocking i could look
you can look it up on your phone it says
medical definition the administration of
a drug to bring about a mark reduction
in the body's production of androgens
and especially testosterone and i'm
saying as a pediatrician
who takes care of hundreds of these kids
when you use that terminology you were
being malignant and harmful i mean there
are some who would say that giving
chemical castration drugs to kids is
malignant and harmful it's about the
context of caring for a child and and
seeing the
the suffering that kids can have that
have not been in affirmative home
situations so that was the part in our
conversation where things got um
things got a bit
contentious but i wouldn't say that that
that's when they started to get
contentious actually what we discovered
in doing these interviews is that um
you know i kind of knew going in
i had certain points in mind where where
i thought okay well when i ask this
question
um it you know things might get a little
bit tense and i kind of know well
because that's that's more of a
challenging question
and what i found so often in these
interviews is that things got tense much
earlier than i originally thought they
would
because there were questions that i
thought would be really easy for the
person that i'm talking to that turned
out not to be easy at all
questions like
uh what's the difference between sex and
gender you know these are like
that's that's supposed to be a softball
but even that things start go off the
rails in a lot of these interviews when
i ask even a question like that because
what we found is that these people these
gender ideologues especially the ones
who are in this
industry
and they're making a lot of money
off of promoting gender confusion
especially in kids
it's that what we found is that they are
not prepared
to encounter any
skepticism
at all they're not prepared to answer
any questions
the only questions they're prepared to
answer are the questions that are not
really questions at all right questions
like uh how
how meaningful is it to you to be able
to help people in their gender journey
like that those kind of questions or
it's just a setup for them to give a
pre-planned canned you know speech
so by the time we got to this exchange
it'd already gotten pretty tense and uh
and of course i asked her about lupron
now this is a drug that she gives to
kids and as we hear from somebody else
in the film scott nugent um who has
experience with these kinds of drugs
personal experience this drug in
particular is a drug it is actually by
definition chemical castration which is
why i wasn't planning on doing this but
i pulled out my phone look up the the
definition of chemical castration she
said she says that chemical castration
that's a exploitative word and i'm being
malignant and harmful by using that word
well
look up the definition of chemical
castration and that is
a puberty blocker
that is by definition when you give a
kid a puberty blocker you are performing
chemical castration on the kid period
and we know that because the lupron
specifically
has been used
to chemically castrate sex offenders
you notice in that exchange by the way
she didn't deny she she takes issue with
the words that i'm using she threatens
to get up and storm out
um she's offended by the by the
way that i'm phrasing it the words
but she never says
oh no that's that's that's totally
incorrect lupron does not do that
lupron's never been used that way
doesn't say that because she can't i
don't have to tell you that gas prices
are really high right now you've
probably noticed yourself every time you
go to the pump it gives you heartburn
well here's the good news there's an
incredible app that everybody who buys
gas needs to know about and it's called
upside because there is a little bit of
upside when you're pumping gas and this
is it my listeners are earning cash back

using upside just download the app for
free it is a free app to emphasize and
use promo code walls for 25 cents per

the free upside app and use promo code
walsh to get 25 cents per gallon or more
cash back on your first tank just use my
promo code walsh now that's code walsh
and then finally of course we get to the
the question which is the question i ask
uh everyone and uh which is what is a
woman and
probably he's not gonna surprise you by
now that she doesn't exactly have an
answer for it but let's uh let's listen
to what she comes up with
so we're going on this journey
boys can be girls girls can be boys men
can be women women can be men
it makes me wonder
[Music]
what is a woman
what is a woman a woman is someone who
claims that as their identity it could
be many things to many people
that was our answer well a woman is
anyone and that was by the way not to
give any spoilers away but
that is
the answer
from the left to the question which is a
non-answer it's the same thing as not
answering at all but that is that is the
answer a woman is someone who says
everyone
and of course to everyone who gives me
that answer in the film i have the
follow-up well a woman is someone who
identifies as a woman what are they
identifying as and around and around we
go
because they don't have an answer to the
question
this is a
medical doctor
who can't tell you what a woman is
i mean this is someone who who
if someone goes to her and says as a man
and says you know i'm really a woman i
want to transition into a woman
she will help facilitate that process
and yet she doesn't know what the word
means
she doesn't actually know she by her own
testimony
when someone says i want to transition
to a woman she doesn't even know what
that means like what are you
transitioning into
she has no idea
as we found over and over again in the
film and that was just a few minutes of
the film um only one person of the
dozens that we spoke to
and i can tell you right now that um
what we heard in those clips there
i don't think any of it qualifies as
quite the craziest thing we heard the
chicken part gets pretty close still not
all the way there there's there's so
much more that you need to see but you
have to go to what is a woman.com and
subscribe to see it um a lot more where
that came from i promise you

as well okay the end good

﻿During the 13th Century BC, ancient Egypt was
recovering from the turbulent Amarna period
that had greatly weakened the empire.
The most notable pharaoh during this period,
Ramesses the Second, restored Egypt to its
former glory and re-established
its dominance over the region.
He maintained stability within
the empire, preserved its borders,
and built immense monuments throughout Egypt.
His unprecedented 66-year-long reign
and countless achievements immortalized him
throughout the world as “Ramesses the Great”.
The 18th dynasty’s rule of Egypt came to an end
in 1292 BC with the death of Pharaoh Horemheb,
as he left behind no heir to the throne.
Before his death, Horemheb appointed his
Chief Vizier, Paramesse, to succeed him as
pharaoh of Egypt, both to reward Paramesse's
undying loyalty and because he had
a son and a grandson, which ensured
a stable line of succession for the empire.
On becoming Pharaoh, Paramesse changed his name
to Ramesses the First, which translates
to “Established by the strength of Ra”.
He ruled Egypt for less than
two years before dying and was
succeeded by his son, Seti the First.
Seti had a successful reign and was able
to reclaim much of the northern lands that had
been lost under the heretic pharaoh, Akhenaten.
He appointed his 14-year-old son, Ramesses, as
prince regent of the empire and provided him
with a grand household and a personal harem.
Seti also made the boy-prince a captain in the
army and brought him along on military campaigns.
It was around this time that Ramesses, then a
teenager, married his principal wife, Nefertari,
who he was extremely fond of and affectionately
referred to as “The one for whom the sun shines”.
In 1279 BC, after an 11-year reign,
Seti died and was succeeded by his son,
who was proclaimed Ramesses the Second.
By this time, Ramesses was about 24 years
old and had extensive military experience.
His first great achievement came
in his second year on the throne,
when he defeated a band of sea pirates called
the ‘Sherden’, who have been theorized as having
originated from Anatolia, Ionia or Sardinia.
These pirates had been plundering Egyptian
vessels along the Mediterranean coast and
wreaking havoc on the local population.
Ramesses cleverly set a trap for the
Sherden by placing several cargo-laden
vessels in an area off the coast.
The sea pirates took the bait,
which resulted in them being surrounded
by a fleet of Egyptian warships.
Ramesses managed to overwhelm and capture
the Sherden pirates in one single action.
The surviving sea pirates were
taken to Egypt as prisoners
and forced to serve as personal bodyguards to
the pharaoh for the remainder of their lives.
Ramesses’ most famous engagement occurred during
the fifth year of his reign, when he fought
against the king of the Hittites, Muwatalli the
Second, for control of the Syrian city of Kadesh.
The pharaoh desired a victory at Kadesh
to expand his empire’s borders into Syria,
as well as to recreate his father’s triumphant
arrival into the city a decade earlier.
The Battle of Kadesh became the largest
chariot battle ever fought in history,
involving an estimated 6,000 chariots.
Ramesses was unsuccessful in capturing the city,
but he declared victory upon
returning to Egypt anyway.
The pharaoh went as far as to claim that he had
single-handedly saved the day and inscribed the
story on temple walls all throughout Egypt.
“Here I stand, all alone; there is no one at
my side. My warriors and chariots have
deserted me. None heard my voice when I,
their king, called for aid. But I find that
Amun's grace is far better to me than a million
fighting men and ten thousand chariots!”
“I was ready to fight like an eager bull.
Equipped with my weapons of victory. I charged
their ranks fighting like a pouncing falcon.
I was like Ra when he rises at dawn. My rays
burned the bodies of the rebels. I slew them
without sparing any. They sprawled before my
horses, and lay slain in heaps of blood!”
Although the pharaoh’s interpretation
of those events bordered on fantasy,
a considerable achievement
did eventually result from
the Battle of Kadesh in the form of
the “Egyptian–Hittite peace-treaty”.
In fact, it is the earliest
known peace-treaty in history,
as well as the only ancient treaty in which
written texts from both sides have survived.
The Egyptian–Hittite treaty was successful
at maintaining peace between the two great
powers for the next century, until the
collapse of the Hittite Empire in 1178 BC.
Ramesses went on to successfully suppress
a Nubian rebellion shortly afterwards
and ordered the events immortalized
on a temple-wall in Nubia, where he
is depicted courageously charging into combat on
a war-chariot, alone against a swarm of rebels.
The number of temple buildings that a pharaoh
could afford was perhaps the best indicator of
the empire’s prosperity at the time, and by
that criteria, Ramesses the Second’s reign
is by far the most notable in Egyptian history.
That, along with his early military prowess,
inspired 19th century Egyptologists
to dub him, "Ramesses the Great”.
Ramesses was determined to immortalize
himself in stone, even if it meant
usurping the statues of his predecessors
by inscribing his own cartouche onto them.
Worried that future pharaohs would do the same
to his works, he ordered that his inscriptions
be carved much deeper into stone than
traditionally done, which not only made
them less susceptible to future change, but
also made them more resistant to erosion.
Another method Ramesses used to ensure that
his legacy would outlast the ravages of time
was to build on a grander scale
than any ruler had before him.
The pharaoh had six temples constructed in
Nubia, the most well-known of which are the
two carved into a cliffside at Abu Simbel.
The first temple is called “The Great Temple”
and is devoted to Ramesses the Second himself.
Its construction took about 20 years and was
completed during the pharaoh’s
24th year on the throne.
It is considered to be the most
impressive and beautiful of all
the temples that he built during his reign.
Four colossal statues representing the pharaoh
sit in front of the temple, each wearing
the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt.
An earthquake in 27 BC sheared the head
and torso off one of the middle statues,
which remain fragmented in
front of its feet to this day.
The second temple at Abu Simbel
is called “The Small Temple”,
and is dedicated both to his great royal wife,
Queen Nefertari and the goddess of love, Hathor.
The temple’s entrance lies between
four enormous statues of the pharaoh
and two of Nefertari dressed as Hathor.
This is one of the rare instances in ancient
Egyptian history in which the statue of a
pharaoh and his queen are of equal size.
Ramesses built another colossal statue
of himself that was made of red granite
at The Temple of Ptah, near Memphis, but it
was later discovered broken into six pieces.
It was successfully restored using iron bars
to stabilize it from the inside and is now
located near the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza.
The pharaoh also built a large mortuary complex
called the Ramesseum, which was devoted to
the preservation of his memory as a living god.
The complex was constructed in Upper
Egypt but has been heavily damaged by
floods over the past three millennia due
to its close proximity to the Nile River.
Ramesses went on to build a new capital in
the far north of the empire and called it
Pi-Ramesses, which means “House of Ramesses”.
Pi-Ramesses was located near the Pelusiac branch
of the Nile River and it quickly grew to become
one of the largest cities in ancient Egypt,
inhabited by over 300,000 people.
It continued to flourish for another century
after Ramesses’ reign, until its abandonment in
1060 BC due to the Pelusiac branch silting up,
which left the city without a water source.
Ramesses honored his wife Nefertati after
her death with a large, lavishly decorated
tomb located in the Valley of the Queens.
The wall-paintings within Nefertari’s tomb are
considered to be among some of the greatest works
of art in all of ancient Egyptian history.
At the age of 54, Ramesses joined an
exclusive group of pharaohs who
had ruled Egypt for 30 years.
This occasion was celebrated with
a ritual known as the Sed festival,
which was then repeated every two to three years.
The festival’s purpose was to rejuvenate a
pharaoh's vigor and strength while
they still held the throne, as well
as to commemorate their accomplishments.
Ramesses celebrated an unprecedented 14 Sed 
festivals throughout his life, which eclipsed
any amount ever celebrated by other pharaohs.
Ramesses had over 200 wives and over
100 children, most of whom he outlived.
Towards the end of his life, Ramesses
suffered from artery hardening,
dental decay, and arthritis.
After a reign of 66 years,
he died in 1213 BC at the age of 90 and
was buried in the Valley of the Kings.
He was succeeded by his then 70-year-old son,

when William McKinley became the
president of the United States in 1897
he presided over a country that was
getting a little bit upset
what was it upset about well it was the
island to its South Cuba which at this
point was a Spanish colony and was also
rebelling against said Spanish rule this
rebellion kicked off in 1895 and had
some pretty unfortunate timing
I mean rebellions are always pretty
badly time for those being rebelled
against but it coincided with the
spectacular rise in American nationalism
when these ideas were combined with the
stories about Spanish cruelties in Cuba
the American people got upset as such
the people in the press wanted to do
something about it but McKinley wasn't
too keen it wasn't until the Spanish
ambassador's criticisms of McKinley were
made public that he opted to send a
warship the USS Maine to Cuba in order
to protect American interests in
February 1898 whilst in Havana Harbor
the Maine exploded in a respective of
what the cause of the explosion was the
American people wanted blood so bad was
the public fervor and pressure from
opponent ala Tisha's that McKinley new
war couldn't be avoided and so one April
the 21st 1898 America did just that and
declared war on Spain under the slogan
of remember the Maine
to hell with Spain now Spain knew it
wasn't going to defeat the United States
in a war but chose to fight it anyway
why well there were two main reasons the
first was that Cuba along with the also
revolting Philippines were the last
major vestiges of the once glorious
Spanish Empire and the second reason was
that the dishonor of immediately
surrendering to the US was too much for
Spain to bear his leaders preferred to
go down fighting and lose with its honor
intact so how did said fighting go it
went amazingly well for America you see
America opted to fight the war on two
fronts one in the south in Cuba and one
in the east or to the west technically
in the Philippines this was where
Commodore George Dewey decisively
defeated the Spanish fleet there at the
Battle of Manila Bay the US Army then
landed and brought over the exiled
Filipino revolutionary Emilio Aguinaldo
who promptly declared Filipino
independence to bring the Philippines
back into the fold the Spanish launched
a major fleet hoping to dislodge the
Americans it was shortly after this that
the u.s. captured Guam and by captured I
mean they turned up and gave off a
warning shot now traditionally when
nations were at peace they would fire
off a salute to each other
the Spanish garrison there didn't have
any ammunition so the governor who
didn't know he was at war promptly
apologized for not returning the salute
the island was captured with no fighting
as for the Caribbean theater the US
started by seizing some place in
southern Cuba called Guantanamo Bay it
later landed an expedition
force here and pushed inland the Spanish
retreated but were extremely adept at
defensive tactics and so American
progress was slow until the primary
American force landed on July the 1st
this was the force that contained the
famous Rough Riders volunteer army led
by a certain Theodore Roosevelt the
Americans advanced inland and fought a
small Spanish force at the infamous
Battle of San Juan Hill here the Spanish
were able to inflict many more
casualties and the Americans than they
themself suffered before retreating and
Acacia wandering it was this battle that
made Theodore Roosevelt a household name
July the 3rd saw the largest naval
battle of the war the Battle of Santiago
de Cuba during which the Americans
obliterated the Spanish fleet there it
was after this that the aforementioned
relief force that was being sent to the
Philippines was promptly turned around
because the Spanish coast now lay
undefended Puerto Rico or Puerto Rico
was invaded in late July but Spanish
forces there were incredibly difficult
to dislodge by mid-august the Americans
had captured Santiago the second largest
city in Cuba and in the Philippines the
Spanish governor had surrendered as well
with their forces on the run a much of
their Navy sitting at the bottom of the
ocean the Spanish stood for peace before
the Americans could march on Havana in
December a peace treaty was signed in
which Spain lost Guam the Philippines in
Puerto Rico to the United States Cuba
became a US Protectorate until 1902 when
it gained its independence in conclusion
the war had gone exceptionally well for
America which is why the Secretary of
State John Hay called it a splendid
little war America's naval prowess were
made clear to the world it not a great
deal of soldiers died in combat of
course lots of soldiers died from
disease but since yellow fever didn't
wear a Spanish uniform they didn't count
and for Spain the soldiers who fought on
Cuba and the Philippines had shown
themselves as being some of the best in
the world but of course the shock to
Spanish society for losing the colony of
Cuba was absolutely massive the Spanish
Empire was dead the American Empire was
born I hope you enjoyed this episode and

you're sheltering enemies of the state
are you not
yes
you shall bring them underneath your
floors aren't you yes
point out to me the areas where they're
hiding this is the opening scene of
inglorious bastards and it is well
relatively terrifying what starts out as
a sunny day on a french dairy farm
quickly devolves into a paranoia
drenched life or death interrogation
culminating with the brutal murder of a
hidden jewish family tarantino is a
master of using intriguing and almost
musical dialogue to drive attention this
works in part because tarantino is a
perfectionist brad pitt went as far to
say after filming glorious bastards that
tarantino's set places him as god and
there is no blasphemy perfectionism can
be a blessing and a curse when it comes
to filmmaking for sure sometimes
perfectionism can lead to a film's
budget ballooning from delays and
reshoots but on the other hand a
director who believes in his project and
his writing so much as to settle for
nothing less than his vision can result
in pretty amazing pieces of cinema and
that's kind of what we're looking at
here the sixth film in tarantino canon
was almost scrapped entirely for a
variety of reasons one of those reasons
was that the script had leaked online a
few years prior to release but another
huge reason was that tarantino was
having trouble finding an actor who
could deliver the performance necessary
to make slander work for a while it was
actually leonardo dicaprio who was in
line to play the film's primary
antagonist for all intents and purposes
dicaprio would have probably been
relatively fine he's fluent in german
and could certainly deliver a powerful
performance but tarantino is again a
perfectionist the performance was going
to be absolutely perfect or the film
wasn't going to happen at all tarantino
has even gone on record as to say that
he thought the character might be
unplayable a day before he was about to
scrap the project entirely he met
christoph waltz and was gobsmacked with
the perfection and ease with which he
approached the character he was actually
instructed to hold back his performance
during rehearsals tarantino didn't want
the cast to know how good he actually
was so he instructed boltz to give
everyone a six instead of a 10 during
that process false was told that if he
felt actors begin to get competitive
with him that he was to lose and in turn
the only actor who actually got to see a
full-blown full effort performance
during pre-production was denim and
o'shea who played pierre la pardi in the
film's opening sequence the decision to
hold vaults back was made so that the
actors would have a more authentic
reaction to this well one-of-a-kind
performance this scene in general is
incredibly well written it tells a
complete story that could almost act as
a standalone short film in 19 minutes it
opens on leopardy chopping firewood on
top of a hill there is this rhythmic
quality to which these chops take place
each one of these extraps are about one
second apart this is important because
it sets a cadence we begin the scene
with the sound of what is essentially a
ticking clock as the camera pans to a
small fleet of german troops approaching
this farm when hans arrives we know
there is trouble afoot his uniform alone
could tell you that but the confidence
with which he enters the room gives us
the feeling of a python entering a
hamster cage the contrasting stature of
these actors tells you all you need to
know immediately despite the fact that
this farmer could undoubtably kill hans
very easily by hand if she so desired
han still sort of floats through the
room as if he owns the place while
everyone else around him is trying to
contain sheer and utter terror it's all
subtle and all oh so intimidating now
fultz himself could write a book on how
to be threatening and charming at the
same time and hans seems as cordial and
polite as any house guest could possibly
be but it's the lack of warmth and
pleasantries shown against this sort of
overt politeness that really send a
threatening message to the viewer and
this is again done not through faults
alone but also through the writing he
pauses a little longer than usual he
owes eye contact for just a second too
long and tarantino directs a performance
that has that cadence we already
discussed
and adversely the la perdi family can't
and doesn't look at hans for more than a
brief moment one of the first things
hans does upon entering the home is
request a glass of milk it's not an
usual request after all this is a dairy
farm but by doing this hans puts himself
in this position of status he's letting
the family know that they are there to
serve him in this moment after excusing
the family and reaffirming a spirit of
trust by bringing up the fact that he
left his soldiers outside hans and
pierre can finally get down to brass
tacks we at this point have no idea what
exactly is going on we just know that
this family is likely in danger it's
usually the case when you have a period
piece that in world war ii and germans
are involved but pierre is particularly
on edge about something that we haven't
quite been able to comprehend yet the
request to switch to the english
language might come off as a pandering
to an american audience and by all means
it may very well be however tarantino
spins this later on in a somewhat
brilliant way but we'll get to that in
just a moment hans quickly deserves his
dominance over the entire situation by
forcing pierre to acknowledge that he
knows who hans is by reputation alone
please tell me what you've heard
i've heard
that the fear has put you in charge of
running up the jews left in france
there's a signal of submission to his
authority and again it is done through
this wolf in sheep's clothing utterly
disarming niceness once the power
dynamic has been established pierre
quickly shifts to more of a bartering
phase and out of nervousness goes for
his pipe to calm his nerves after some
light reassurances that this is just a
doubling of efforts in the spirit of
thoroughness hans brings up one specific
jewish family that has been left
unaccounted for while very carefully
making pierre explain in detail what he
remembers about the missing family names
ages descriptions we think he's just
getting information but hans is really
interrogating pierre pierre is giving
away everything he knows as the camera
slowly pans around the table tarantino's
way of telling us that literally and
figuratively the tables have in fact
turned we get the full picture as the
camera pans down under the floorboards
and we see the aforementioned jewish
family huddled in a crawl space hiding
their breathing so as not to give away
their secret they are almost being
crushed by the weight of what is
transpiring above them this is an
eye-opening moment for the viewer as we
now understand that an entire family's
life is at stake and the stakes of the
situation in general are much braver
than we initially anticipated so after
they wrap up the details hans asks for
one final glass of milk making pierre
serve it to him is again just another
psychological twist of the knife before
making his final power play by forcing
pierre to call him by his nickname that
they call you to johan
precisely
from this point on hans plays out his
winning hand one card at a time he loves
this moniker because he earned that
moniker hanz asks if he might be able to
smoke his pipe and boom almost comical
as well like a looney tunes gag a way
for hans to insult pierre before going
in for the kill and a message to pierre
that the game is over hans drops all the
pleasantries and tells peer that he
knows everything the jig is up facial
expressions shift into something more
monstrous and hans tells pierre that he
not only knows that he is hiding jews in
his home but that they are under the
floorboards exactly where we've seen
them before this is where tarantino's
stroke of brilliance with the languages
comes into play from a filmmaking
standpoint switching to english for the
scene would likely ease producers
concerns of an american movie-going
audience's ability to understand the
film without being confused but within
the structure of this scene hans knowing
that the family was under the floorboard
from the moment he walked into the room
we now know he switched to english so
that they couldn't understand what was
happening when pierre was forced to give
them up hans resumes his ruse and the
family is murdered in the dirt they were
hiding in shashana running away is the
final image we have in the scene and
hans allows her to live his final words
feel like they are left unfinished
as if he was going to add until we meet
again he doesn't care if she lives or
dies because he views her as lesser as a
rodent nothing more nothing less it just
so happens though that this moment gives
this rodent the resolve to lock every
high-ranking german official in a
crowded theater and bring them alive
later in the film this 19-minute opening
scene of in glorious bastards is a
masterpiece of not only storytelling and
writing but also acting it should come
as no surprise that christophel won an
oscar for his performance in the film
because he was able to capture a variety
of different emotions attitudes and
really personalities in ways that turn a
human being who by all accounts in real
life is very nice into something much
more sinister and inhuman this may not
be a case of casting the right actor in
the right role it may very well be a
case of casting the only actor who could
conceivably play this role with any
level of believability the scene being a
testament to how keeping that perfection
in your sights without compromise can
yield amazing results well that's it for

hi friends Benjamin is with you and
today I want to tell you another
heartbreaking story on the 11th of
August 2008 a Monday Sarah Whitmer a
24-year-old dental hygienist and her
27-year-old husband Ryan Whitmer a
sports planner were at their home in
Fort Thomas Kentucky United
States Sarah had just finished her work
at a dental practice and Ryan had
completed his day as well the couple who
had met through mutual friends and
quickly become Inseparable enjoyed a
quiet evening together their
relationship had blossomed from a blind
date at a pub to buying a house getting
married and being in the midst of newly
wed Bliss having been married for only 4
months as they looked forward to their
future
which included plans for a Costa Rica
honeymoon and a vacation to Cancun the
most exciting anticipation was centered
around the prospect of getting a new
puppy a venture they were actively
pursuing together on the night of August
11th Ryan and Sarah Whitmer enjoyed
leftover hamburgers corn on the cob and
cheesy potatoes while watching
TV according to Ryan they started with
some of Sarah's favorite shows before
switching to a football game
subsequently Sarah decided to take a
bath in the master bedroom's bathroom
Ryan recalled that she asked him to
check the doors before he joined her
upstairs he remembered her walking
upstairs after they both said I love you
she walks on her tippy toes as she often
did at 10:49 p.m. that night Ryan called
911 the call lasted 7 minutes he told
the 911 dispatcher that his wife had
fallen asleep in the bathtub at their
home in Marrow Ohio Ryan told the
dispatcher my wife she fell asleep in
the bathtub I think I was downstairs I
just came up here and she was laying
face down in the
bathtub Ryan explained to the dispatcher
that he had been downstairs watching TV
and upon going upstairs he discovered
Sarah lying face down in the bathtub he
mentioned that she had a habit of
falling asleep in the tub regularly
following the dispatcher's instructions
Ryan undertook the process of removing
Sarah from the bathtub and was guided
through administering
CPR during this time he temporarily
placed the phone down as he emptied the
tub and lifted Sarah taking
approximately 29
seconds the police arrived at his
residence within 6 minutes of the 911
call and found Sarah naked on the
bedroom floor although her body felt
warm and dry her hair was wet while
attempting CPR the police observed a
pinkish white frothy discharge emanating
from Sarah's mouth and nose indicative
of drowning when paramedics arrived they
made two unsuccessful attempts to
intubate Sarah in the bedroom
subsequently two more attempts were made
in the ambulance during the 10-minute
Journey to the hospital despite a fifth
unsuccessful intubation attempt a sixth
attempt by the emergency room physician
at the hospital was eventually
successful unfortunately it was too late
and Sarah was pronounced dead that same
night when questioned at the hospital
Ryan informed the police that he and
Sarah were alone at home that night he
mentioned watching a football game on
the downstairs TV while Sarah was taking
a bath at around 1 p.m. expressing
concern he conveyed to the police that
he had been afraid she might fall asleep
in the tub when asked whether Sarah had
fallen asleep in the bathtub before Ryan
responded negatively but noted that she
had a tendency to fall asleep in unusual
places despite Ryan's assertion to the
police that he found Sarah in the
bathtub and believed she had fallen
asleep law enforcement grew
suspicious upon arriving at the house
they noted Sarah's body was dry yet her
hair was wet detectives perceived
inconsistencies in Ryan's account
particularly in relation to the 911 call
where he described finding Sarah lying
face down in the tub there were doubts
arising from a potential contradiction
as they believed Ryan had told the nurse
of the hospital that he found her lying
face
up during the search of the widmer's
residence law enforcement noticed
several discrepancies that raised
additional concerns the bathroom floor
bathroom mat and the towel on the floor
were all dry the bathtub itself was
mostly dry with only a few droplets
observed around the drain notably there
were no wet towels found in the house
further inconsistencies in Ryan's
narrative were uncovered by the
police Ryan had initially informed them
that he was watching a Cincinnati
Bengals football game on the TV
downstairs while Sarah took a bath
however upon inspection the downstairs
TV was not set to that channel instead
the bedroom TV was tuned to the
specified Channel additionally police
discovered blood stains on the bedroom
carpet where Sarah had been found lying
on the floor when they arrived these
findings heightened suspicions and
contributed to the growing list of
inconsistencies in Ryan's account of the
events that transpired that night Dr
Russell up to Grove the Warren County
coroner conducted the autopsy on Sarah
his findings revealed that Sarah's cause
of death was drowning notably there were
several physical injuries documented
during the examination including faint
bruising on the right side of her
forehead a peal Hemorrhage on the inner
surface of her eyelid bruising on the
left side of her neck a contusion on the
back of her neck an abrasion on her left
armpit and bruising and lacerations to
her upper lip Sarah exhibited deep
muscle hemorrhaging in the anterior part
of her neck and contusions to her
scalp drct upag Grove concluded that
Sarah's death was a result of homicide
he expressed the opinion that the
injuries Sarah sustained occurred before
her death and were inconsistent with
injuries typically associated with CPR
procedures
the toxicology reports confirmed the
absence of prohibited substances or
alcohol in Sarah's
system remarkably on the 13th of August
2008 a mere 2 days after Sarah's death
Ryan was arrested on a charge of
aggravated murder it was the
prosecution's case that Sarah died as a
result of drowning it was their case
that the cause of Sarah's death was not
so much as dispute but the manner in
which she she died was how did she
drown the prosecution contended that the
evidence from the 911 call the crime
scene and Sarah's injuries collectively
pointed to Ryan as the perpetrator of
her death their argument centered on the
assertion that he had forcibly held her
underwater causing her to drown in the
bathtub during the investigation the
police dusted the bathtub for
fingerprints and identified streak marks
believed to have been created by human
hands primar located in the middle of
the tub employing a superglue fuming
process and reflected ultraviolet
Imaging they detected finger marks and
smear marks additionally a forearm
impression was discovered on the bathtub
determined to be made by an adult male
based on the testing of hair
follicles however the timing of when the
impression was made could not be
ascertained the prosecution further
contended that the absence of wetness
inside the bathroom was inconsistent
with the scenario Ryan described if
Sarah had drowned and Ryan had pulled
her out of the bathtub the floor and
other items in the bathroom should have
been wet they emphasized to the jury
that when the police arrived just
minutes after Ryan's 911 call Sarah's
body was dry the prosecution pointed to
the details in the 911 call asserting
that Ryan had divulged too much
information and was orchestrating the
call suggesting a level of
premeditation the prosecution presented
a narrative to the jury suggesting that
a violent confrontation occurred in the
vidmer home on that fateful night
although the reasons behind it remained
unknown to support their case they
brought in an expert witness who
testified that it was highly improbable
to fall asleep and drown in a bathtub
without the influence of prohibited
substances or
alcohol according to this testimony the
sensation of water on the face or the
triggering of the gag reflex would
typically awaken an individual and
failing that a decrease in oxygen levels
would prompt the person to wake up
coroner up grve who conducted Sarah's
autopsy was called by the prosecution to
provide his expert opinion on the events
of that night he testified that for
Sarah to have a dry body and wet hair a
plausible explanation would involve her
head being pushed over the edge of the
bathtub toilet or sink this act might
have occurred either forwards or
backward within running water or
submerged in full
water the heart of the prosecution's
case was the assertion that Ryan
deliberately held Sarah's Head
Underwater until she drowned and based
on this premise they argued that he
should be found guilty of her
murder in response the defense countered
that there was a lack of evidence to
support the claim that Ryan had killed
Sarah they emphasized the apparent love
between the couple and argued that there
was no discernable motive for Ryan to
harm Sarah according to the defense
those who knew Ryan had never witnessed
him displaying anger or raising his
voice Friends of the couple attested to
their happiness and shared belief that
they were making plans for a positive
future together to strengthen their
position the defense conducted their own
autopsy presumably aiming to challenge
or provide an alternative perspective to
the findings presented by the
prosecution's witnesses particularly
corer up to
Grove on August 15th 2008 2 days
following the initial autopsy a second
autopsy was conducted by Dr wner Spitz
who had been retained by the defense
although he concurred with the
conclusion that Sarah's cause of death
was drowning Dr Spitz expressed a
different opinion on the manner of death
stating he would have ruled it as
undetermined he observed various
injuries including those to her neck
arms near the crease of her elbow upper
lip nape of her neck scalp a tear in her
liver and hemorrhaging to her neck Dr
Spitz couldn't definitively ascertain
whether these injuries were the result
of
CPR consequently he asserted that he
would not categorize her death as a
homicide the defense argued that if
there had been a violent altercation as
suggested by the prosecution there would
have been evidence of it notably the
absence of injuries on both Ryan and
Sarah's unbroken or chipped Nails was
highlighted the defense also brought
attention to the presence of female DNA
found under Sarah's fingernails with no
match identified they contended that the
injuries observed on Sarah were likely a
consequence of the extended CPR and
multiple intubation attempts carried out
that night both inside the house in the
ambulance parked outside the house
during transport to the hospital and at
the hospital itself the defense posited
the theory that something medical such
as a seizure or cardiac ailment could
have been the underlying cause of
Sarah's death they also offered an
explanation for the seemingly
contradictory evidence of Sarah's dry
body and wet hair suggesting that skin
dries faster than hair in the initial
trial the jury found Ryan not guilty of
aggravated murder but convicted him of
murder however a few months later a new
trial was ordered due to concerns raised
by the defense it was discovered that
some jurors had conducted their own
tests regarding the time it took them to
dry after having a bath potentially
influencing their understanding of the
evidence Ryan's second trial occurred in
May
2010 however the jury was unable to
reach a verdict leading to the
Declaration of a
mistrial in January 2011 Ryan's third
trial commenced
introducing additional evidence into the
legal proceedings the defense aimed to
build a case suggesting that Sarah may
have had an undisclosed cardiovascular
or neurological condition that led to a
loss of consciousness resulting in her
drowning in the bathtub to support this
argument they presented testimony from
several medical experts who proposed the
possibility of such an underlying
medical issue however the state
countered these assertions by calling
their own medic IAL experts to challenge
and refute the defense's claims the
testimony from Sarah's co-workers
provided additional insight into her
health and daily
routine they recounted instances where
Sarah would sleep in her car before
starting work in the mornings and would
also go out to her car to rest during
her lunch
breaks colleagues further revealed that
she suffered from allergies and
experienced headaches and stomach pains
on at least one occasion her headaches
were severe enough to cause blurred
Vision prompting her to retreat to a
dark room until the symptoms
subsided Dr Benjamin Mesmer a dentist at
the practice where Sarah worked took the
stand and testified that he was present
on the day Sarah died he recalled that
she complained of a headache and stomach
ache on that particular day the
testimony of Sarah's friends painted a
picture of her tendency to fall asleep
in unconventional places such as during
a game or in the middle of group convers
ations the situation was significant
enough that one of her friends suggested
she might have narcolepsy a sleep
disorder characterized by excessive
sleepiness sleep paralysis
hallucinations and in some cases
episodes of cataplexy contrastingly
Sarah's mother Ruth andne Stewart
testified on behalf of the prosecution
she stated that she had never observed
anything unusual about her daughter's
sleep
patterns although Sarah did experience
headaches Ruth believed they were likely
the result of sinus issues according to
Ruth's testimony she spoke to Sarah on
the day she died as Sarah was heading
home from work and Sarah made no mention
of having a
headache Ruth emphasized that there was
no family history of seizures heart
disease or cardiac problems while Sarah
had a heart murmur as a baby and a cleft
pallet a June 2008 physical examination
report did not mention the continued
presence of a heart murmur additionally
there was no indication of any cardiac
ailment neurological defect or disease
in the report Jennifer crew's testimony
provided a significant and potentially
damning account according to her
statements she had contacted Ryan when
he was in prison after watching a DAT
line episode featuring his case she
claimed that on October 26th 2009 at
11:06 p.m. Ryan called her and confessed
to killing Sarah Jennifer testified that
Ryan said I did it I did it I killed
Sarah I did it in her testimony Jenifer
recounted that Ryan described a heated
argument with Sarah in their living room
focusing on issues related to his
alleged infidelity drinking smoking and
engagement with
pornography the argument purportedly
escalated upstairs where Sarah informed
Ryan that their marriage was over
according to Jennifer the confrontation
turned physical with Ryan allegedly
stating nobody leaves me nobody ever
leaves me and I mean nobody Jennifer's
testimony took a darker turn as she
detailed Ryan's alleged admission of
violence according to Jennifer Ryan
confessed to punching Sarah in the chest
during their confrontation causing her
to fall backward and hit her head Ryan
claimed to have blacked out and upon
regaining Consciousness he found Sarah
on the floor unresponsive and not
breathing with wet hair furthermore
Jennifer asserted that during the 911
call Ryan merely pretended to perform
CPR because he was aware that Sarah was
already dead rendering resuscitation
futle despite this shocking Revelation
Jennifer continued to have conversations
with Ryan after their initial
discussion it wasn't until after Ryan's
second trial ended in a mistrial that
she reported the incriminating
conversation to the police in response
to Jennifer's testimony the defense
sought to undermine her
credibility they presented evidence
regarding her past struggles with
prescription drug addiction and
convictions for misdemeanor theft aiming
to cast doubt on the reliability of her
statements and motives the defense
presented a challenging scenario arguing
that they could not definitively explain
what caused Sarah to drown that night
the defense urged the jury to consider
all the facts surrounding the case and
emphasiz ized that Ryan had no apparent
motive to harm
Sarah despite these arguments Ryan was
ultimately found guilty of murder and
sentenced to 15 years to life in
prison interestingly one of the jurors
from the third trial highlighted Ryan's
behavior in court as a significant
factor in their guilty verdict the juror
noted that Ryan displayed no reaction
when autopsy photos were presented in
court suggesting that this lack of
emotional response
influen the perception of his guilt what

The Alien franchise has made an indelible
mark on film history and future, but with
prequels and sequels expanding the original
story over a span of several decades, it can
be hard to untangle what's really going on
here.
What's the Alien movie saga really about?
Let's explore.
The Alien movie story begins when a protohuman
on Earth drinks a deadly poison that kills
him and dissolves his body into strands of
human DNA, which is then dosed into the water
supply.
Several million years later, Dr. Elizabeth
Shaw believes she has found a map and an invitation
to the planet where these protohumans originated.
"I think they want us to come and find them."
She calls them Engineers, and she wrongly
assumes they want to meet their children.
Shaw and a scientific crew are hired by the
Weyland Corporation to find the Engineers
on Planet LV-223, and after a great deal of
trouble, they arrive.
But the Engineers are all dead.
Their spacecraft is filled with jars of toxic
black goo corresponding to egg-like sacs that
begin to open once signs of life appear.
Yes, Dr. Shaw finds her Engineers, a lifelong
passion bordering on obsession.
But what she didn't expect to find was that
the Engineers had set a course to Earth with
the intention of wiping out the human race
they had created.
The Engineers never had their chance as they
themselves were wiped out by an ever-evolving
Neomorph, the predecessor to the Xenomorph
seen later in the series.
Megalomaniacal android David decides to take
up the Engineers' mantle and infect the human
crew.
"Big things have small beginnings."
After chaos, destruction, and an encounter
with a revived Engineer who proves his hostility
toward humans, David and Dr. Shaw escape to
the Engineers' home.
Shaw's new obsession is understanding why
the Engineers planned to kill all the humans.
Was greed one of the human foibles that led
the Engineers to want to eliminate us?
It's Peter Weyland's greedy obsession for
immortality that drives him to create the
android David, who eventually surpasses his
maker and winds up creating the Xenomorph
as we know it.
Did the Engineers know or come to suspect
that human behavior would be the universe's
eventual destruction?
All signs point to yes.
Dr. Shaw never actually makes it to the Engineers'
home planet, which she and David have been
calling Paradise.
Instead, David kills her and drops the black
goo on the thriving planet.
He cultivates Xenomorph eggs, and sends out
a welcoming signal to try and attract new
lifeforms to what is now his planet.
The Covenant is a colonizer craft set out
for one of the few remaining known habitable
planets in the universe, Origae-6, along with
an entire ecosystem on board.
The Covenant crew is awakened from hypersleep
years early, and, on a hunch, they divert
from their course to check out the signal
coming from the unnamed planet.
"A human being out there where there can't
be any humans.
A hidden planet that turns up out of nowhere
and just happens to be perfect for us?
It's too good to be true."
So much of the Alien story is based on humans
terraforming faraway planets because the Earth
was either becoming or already was uninhabitable.
Thanks to climate change and war, the privileged
few humans who could escape our planet did,
and with apparent gusto.
It didn't seem to bother them that they would
spend decades of their lives in hypersleep
to get to these planets and start rebuilding.
Without these humans looking for new places
to colonize, the Xenomorph would never have
found its perfect host to propagate its own
species, with a little help from David.
David has been engineering a new form of the
Xenomorph, "a perfect organism", that he can
finally test on human subjects.
With the crew on board the Covenant is Walter,
the newest model android, who senses his counterpart
is up to no good.
When David finds out Covenant has an entire
colony of hundreds of humans, it's a battle
to stop him before he commandeers the ship
for his own purposes.
When he does, we start to realize why the
Engineers wanted to destroy their human creation.
Like their ancestors, humans also decided
to play god and created synthetic life in
their own image.
David's god complex mirrors his creator Weyland's,
and now David has created a monster.
In the Alien vision of the future, android
technology mirrors human emotional development.
David and Walter are different models of clone
androids in Prometheus and Covenant, designed
by Peter Weyland for different means to different
ends.
David was a special creation, made to match
Weyland's great intelligence and one day surpass
it.
"He is the closest thing to a son I will ever
have.
Unfortunately, he is, he is not human.
He will never grow old, and he will never
die."
Walter was created to be a faithful companion
to its human counterpart.
A protector and source of support.
As Alien begins, it's been 16 years since
we left David and the spaceship Covenant.
A salvaging team on the ship Nostromo answers
a distress call on planet LV-426, even though
they aren't equipped for a rescue mission.
A hair second too late, Ellen Ripley figures
out the distress call is actually a warning,
but one of her crew, Kane, has already been
infected by a Xenomorph facehugger.
Breaking quarantine protocols, Kane is allowed
back on board, where the alien hatches and
wreaks bloody havoc.
Ash, a crew member who's secretly an android,
receives a communique from people at the Company,
who want him to bring the creature back alive
no matter the human cost.
Here, the android Ash is nowhere near as sophisticated
as either David or Walter, presumably because
these droids ended up being dangerously advanced.
But Ash was also a danger to humans, especially
once he got his marching orders to bring the
Xenomorph back alive.
Disobeying orders, Ripley and her crew hunt
the monster and eventually kill it.
As one of the most memorable survivors put
to screen, Ripley strikes a perfect balance
between strength and vulnerability, as well
as professionalism and competence.
Even though she is met with disbelief when
she first discusses the reality of the Xenomorph,
she refuses to be gaslighted.
Ripley and the cat Jones are the only survivors
who end this portion of the Alien saga, tucked
safely in hypersleep, waiting to be found
by another ship.
Interestingly, Jones was an excellent first
alert system, since he'd tried to warn multiple
people about the presence of the alien on
board the Nostromo.
And, like Ripley, nobody listened to him at
first.
But Jones would go on to survive the series
longer than any other human character outside
of our well-known heroine.
You'd think that when one of the deadliest
and most virulent creatures to ever exist
surfaces, the logical thing to do would be
to exterminate it, especially if it has the
power to destroy every planet it touches.
But because of corporate greed, opportunistic
humans attempt to capitalize financially off
the creature at the expense of other humans
with less powerful positions.
"You sent them out there, and you didn't even
warn them.
Why didn't you warn them, Burke?"
The arrogance of man we see throughout the
entire series is a scathing indictment of
an obsession with violence and killing.
There are few women in much of the Alien saga,
but it's the women who ultimately fight against
these deadly obsessions.
At the start of Aliens, Ripley has drifted
in hypersleep for 57 years before she's awakened
and ends up on the military vessel Sulaco.
Unfortunately, the Sulaco is under instruction
to return to LV-426, where Hadley's Hope,
a human colony, has suddenly stopped responding
to all communication.
Ripley is in severe post-traumatic stress,
which turns into grief when she finds out
her daughter died on Earth while she was in
hypersleep.
Worse still, her claims about the alien monster
with acid for blood aren't taken seriously
enough to stop the mission.
"Because if one of those things gets down
here, then that will be all!
Then all this, this bulls---, that you think
is so important, you can just kiss all that
goodbye!"
On LV-426, the Sulaco crew and Ripley search
the seemingly abandoned colony and find a
new Xenomorph nest.
The eggs have already hatched and used the
entire colony as incubators, with the exception
of one survivor, a young girl named Newt.
Newt is the same age Ripley's daughter was
when she first left Earth, so Ripley is immediately
protective of her.
Once the Sulaco's military crew realize the
Xenomorph threat is as horrific as Ripley
insisted, they try to escape.
But as in Alien, once again corporate and
military greed leads to sabotage, this time
from Burke, who's determined to preserve a
Xenomorph specimen.
He and the creature are both defeated, and
Ripley survives, joined by Newt, Jones the
cat, Corporal Hicks, and the torso of android
Bishop, who proves to be a portrait of empathy,
one in which we can see shades of earlier
Walter.
The reveal that Ripley's daughter has died
becomes key to her character.
It explains why she's so protective of the
women in her orbit going forward, especially
young girls.
Even by the time she's Hybrid Ripley in Resurrection,
she has a fierce maternal side, shown in the
way she shields the android Call as well as
a continued deep distrust of the "company
men."
When Hybrid Ripley has an alien baby who imprints
on her, she's horrified and disgusted by the
monster, but at the same time feels their
connection and weeps openly when she has to
kill it.
Shortly after Ripley enters hypersleep on
the Sulaco, a fire breaks out, killing everyone
else on board and shooting her pod into space.
It lands on penal colony Fiorina 161, where
the Sulaco shuttle also crashes.
But Ripley isn't the sole survivor: A Xenomorph
had also made it and had impregnated her before
ejecting her onto Fiorina 161.
The penal colony has essentially been abandoned
by the people who created it, the Weyland-Yutani
Corporation, until they find out there's a
live Xenomorph on board and that Ripley is
carrying an alien fetus in her chest.
"The company knows everything that happened
on the ship.
It all goes into the computer and gets sent
back to network."
Because it is a prison planet run by convicts,
there are no weapons to fight the monster
other than a steel forge that hasn't been
used in decades.
Ripley and the prisoners still finally manage
to kill the loose Xenomorph, again at huge
human cost.
When Weyland-Yutani emissaries arrive, they're
headed by Michael Bishop, the human template
for the android Bishop.
But Ripley knows better than to trust company
men by now, and she throws herself into a
pit of molten steel so nobody can try to weaponize
the alien monster within her.
Ripley's already sacrificed so much in fighting
this creature.
Here, she gives up the last thing she has
left.
Because humans can't seem to leave well enough
alone when it comes to universe-destroying
acid-blooded creatures, Alien: Resurrection
continues the story 200 years later, when
the United Systems Military is still trying
to recreate a functioning Xenomorph aboard
the USS Auriga.
Using Ripley's melded human and alien DNA
recovered from Fiorina 161, new crops of military
scientists tinker with her code to clone the
Xenomorph.
They've engineered a hybrid version of Ripley
who has green nails, acid blood, and vague
memories from the original Ripley who died
centuries before.
The scientists have also finally created a
working Xenomorph, but like Ripley, it's not
the same creature it once was.
It's worlds smarter and understands English.
"So.
We're a fast learner."
A salvage team from the ship Betty boards
the Auriga with human cargo that will be used
to create more monsters for military might.
A new android, Call, is on her own mission
to kill the hybrid Ripley before she can give
the military the queen that was gestating
in her chest.
She fails her mission, but Call's role here
is also to show how android progression in
the series has reached near-human status,
with a machine who's more human than inhuman.
Ripley attempts to kill the queen before she
gives birth, but is also too late.
However, the queen doesn't give birth to eggs
as past queens have.
Instead, it gives birth to a fully formed
alien with many of Ripley's features.
The huge baby alien kills the queen, thinking
Ripley is its actual mother, and Ripley is
forced to kill her "baby," while the Auriga
crashes into Earth.
Ripley finally makes it back to her home planet,
sort of.
"I'm a stranger here myself."
Long before the Alien prequels introduced
the Neomorph, the creature evolved over the
course of each original film, both in physicality
and intelligence.
While its evolution is confusing at first,
by Alien: Covenant we learn David is the "father"
of the Xenomorph as we know it from Alien
and beyond.
The black ooze cultivated by the Engineers
was a biological weapon with the ability to
mutate its host, hence why we see several
different versions of the monster over the
course of Prometheus and Alien: Covenant.
The Xenomorph is a perfect killing machine,
and one of the sad lessons never learned by
humans was to leave the thing alone.
It cannot be tamed.
It can only be killed, and even that proves
an almost impossible feat for hundreds of
years.
Even though Hybrid Ripley appears to kill
the last of the Xenomorphs, who knows whether
they have persisted on another planet out
in the universe, waiting for a meatsack to
arrive and play host.

they call her real-life mermaid a golden
haired girl with the tail of a fish who
swims the shock stingrays and make
friends with killer whales and dolphins
which is no creature of a fairy tale or
may this is a story of a modern-day
mermaid his life underwater took the
world by storm whose journey provided
incredible ability of the mind body and
spirit this is a story of mermaid
Melissa born in st. Augustine Florida
Melissa Durham stood on her life as any
other child but her Elias saw her
spending more time near the water than
any other kid of her age she would spend
hours in the pool at the beach or
visiting local waterpark whenever she
could people started calling her a fish
then a dolphin and then a male as she
grew older Melissa started to take
lessons in modeling for children while
the time she was 15 years of age she
knew what she wanted to be she had
visited Universal Studios animal actors
show at a local theme park and was
fascinated by animal trainers who host
the show she wanted to be just like that
an animal trainer when she approached
Universal they agreed to hire her as a
weekend show attendant
for three years Melissa worked their
thirst as a shower attendant then as a
cage cleaner and then in the show Rose
finally her hard work had paid off
Universal Studios hired her as an animal
trainer Melissa had achieved her first
dream job training acting and modeling
after the fresh new experience of her
working near universal studios she
decided to head for California for her
new goal to try her luck in Tinseltown
sounds a lot like Tortuga to me Melissa
experienced the highs and lows of living
in Santa Monica California she learned
the harshest truth of the industry and
its peers at one stage she proved to
herself that she could take on a
corporate role performing as a product
manager for a large corporate company
but still she knew that something was
missing from her life
the water was calling to her her
opportunity came in 2005 when she joined
a large public aquatic entertainment
park in Orlando her first role was as a
pearl diver and in aquatic entertainer
who would stay submerged in the water
with no breathing apparatus as they
professional free diver she would hold
her breath while flipping underwater
eight times in a row or lay at the
bottom of a lagoon exhaling 20 bubble
rings on one single breath for minutes
at a time underwater she could still be
seen smiling and waving at onlooking
guests never showing the strain eight or
more hours a day Melissa could be seen
performing underwater building up a very
strong endurance being known for her
lungs of Steel while performing in the
windows that same year Melissa decided
to do something that would catapult her
into an unprecedented online success she
decided to hold her breath underwater
for as long as she could she later said
that she decided to do it as a
dedication tribute to her friend that
had recently passed away even with years
of experience practice and training
behind what she was good at Melissa now
says it was no easy thing to do and
discourages others from trying this
without proper training practice and
supervision in the same year Melissa
decided to go for her professional scuba
certification
she was now spending more time
underwater without any gear but decided
to take the next step anyway she wanted
to reach further down and explore the
creatures of the sea 2005 was also the
year Melissa started posting her videos
on YouTube
since then melissa has kept a steady
presence in the cyber world reaching out
to millions of viewers today her aquatic
entertainment business has a website
that spreads her message and latest
projects in globe her YouTube channel
videos have been watched over a million
times by 2007 she thought she had done
everything she could have done and
wanted to move on she was about to leave
Florida once again for another job in
Las Vegas when her life decided to take
another turn this time she was to become
a Marine Mammal trainer the turn
involved working with killer whales and
dolphins and it did not turn out to be
an easy transition Melissa had to work
every inch of the way
she wanted to become what she had always
wanted to be deep down her heart
a mermaid luckily the progression to
become the modern-day creature of a
mermaid was not as difficult as the
previous roles although there was no
less planning she put into it the
popularity of her ever increasing online
video library soared as well she
perfected her motions and decided to
swim upstream from Florida to South
Carolina 2011 saw Melissa spending his
summer at Ripley's Believe It or Not
aquarium in Myrtle Beach as a lead
professional mermaid she entertained
visitors seven days a week four shows a
day all summer long with no break
melissa has her on aquatic entertainment
company called mermaid Melissa LLC it's
featuring her team of both mermaids
Merman and pirates savvy she is now a
professional mermaid for hire willing to
perform anywhere in the world this is a
life that involves danger something I
really like and is prone to many sinus
issues ear infections are not uncommon
in her line of work sometimes her very
life is on the line despite the danger
and fame recognition is now following
her she has also been interviewed on
radio shows TV interviews magazines
newspaper articles live TV broadcast
special websites and other mermaid viral
videos
being a creature of the deep melissa
believes she has a duty to help protect
the very environment that helps her feel
at home not surprisingly her shows and
video clips all spread the same message
let's help the oceans before all
creatures become mythical it's a message
she holds close to her heart
and conveys to everyone the journey has
been a long one with countless hours of
practice training and sheer hard work
Melissa does not believe it as yet
reaches climax and the possibilities in
front of her are endless she wants to
dive deeper explore further and
challenge herself beyond what she knows
her limits to be today but above all she
always remembers else who inspired her
most and those who seem to be her
greatest admirers such as me Captain
Jack Sparrow
you

sometimes the noise of news reporting
can numb the significance of a story for
example the ongoing talks with north
korea
over its nuclear arsenal the fury and
force of a nuclear bomb
something we all hope will never
experience
truly has to be seen to be believed
which brings us to this report from
david martin
miles back observers from all services
and several allied nations
stand by for the first daylight tower
shot
[Music]
the terrible swift power of nuclear
weapons has to be seen to be believed
this is a really big fireball i'll be
about two miles across
now thanks to a project headed by greg
spriggs
at lawrence livermore national
laboratory in california
the public can see them as never before
it's unclassified it's not a threat to
national security
starting in 1945 the u.s conducted 210
nuclear tests above ground
all of them recorded on film from as
many angles as possible
i now declare that the united states
does not propose to conduct
nuclear tests in the atmosphere so long
as other states
do not do so that ended in 1963 when for
the good of the planet
the u.s and the soviet union agreed to
stop testing in the atmosphere
let's play this in fast motion and you
can see that mock stem crawling up
unlike most of us spriggs understands
the physics that produces these
spectacular images
temperatures can reach anywhere from
about 10 million degrees up to about 15
million degrees initially
degrees calvin very hot very hot at the
outer edge of the fireball
is a shock wave but the fireball doesn't
vaporize
the shock wave crushes see those tiny
objects in the foreground
those are tanks about to be hit by the
shock wave
when it first starts off it's moving at
mach 100
100 times the speed of sound and then
there is the mushroom shaped cloud which
climbs into the sky spewing radiation
that's directly tied to the nuclear
fallout which was very very sensitive to
the cloud heights
using a computer to measure the cloud
from one blast
spriggs discovered the original
calculations made 50 years ago
were off by a full mile instead of 35
000 feet it was something like 40 000
feet and it was because of the way they
measured it
that made him wonder if calculations
from all the other blasts were wrong as
well
it was more than just academic curiosity
those calculations are used to predict
the performance
what spriggs calls the yield of today's
weapons
if you measure the shock wave radius and
you're off by one percent
you will be off by five percent in the
yield so spriggs set out to re-analyze
and then release to the public
the estimated 9 000 rolls of film that
had been shot
he found most of them in the archives at
los alamos national laboratory in new
mexico
birthplace of the atom bomb untouched
for decades
a vast scientific treasure trove left to
decay
i've had a challenge with some cans just
getting the can open
jim moy is one of this country's
foremost film preservationists
once entrusted with the supruder film of
president kennedy's assassination
he now has the job of retrieving the
only visual record
of america's most fearsome weapons i
want to first
once i open a can determine the
condition of the film and
one way is by smell because any
acetate-based film
as the base that carries the image
starts to decay
it will put off an odor which is called
vinegar syndrome smells like vinegar
does exactly it sounds like basically
it's a race against time
it really is because until those cans
are opened
you don't know the condition some of the
film has been lost forever
but moy was able to restore most of it
using a scanner to convert
each frame to a digital file here we're
able to analyze all the fireball films
in an automated way digital technology
allowed sprigs to analyze the films with
much greater precision those are high
energy x-rays running down the cable and
vaporizing the cable
and he found that the measurements made
decades ago over the pacific ocean and
nevada desert
were inaccurate the best they could do
in the 50s
was on the order about plus or minus
seven maybe ten percent
so we're talking maybe plus or minus 100
kilotons for a one megaton shot
a kiloton is an explosion equivalent to
one thousand tons of tnt
100 kilotons is about six times bigger
than the bomb which leveled hiroshima
killing a third of the population the
pentagon would not tell us if the new
data from the old tests had forced any
change
in current nuclear targeting plans but
that does not change the impact of
simply looking at
images like this frozen for one
millionth of a second from two miles
away
this fireball truly looks like an alien
come to devour the earth
what do you hope the public gets out of
i hope they appreciate just
how horrific these weapons are this is
something that
can kill millions of people in the blink
of an eye
spriggs is one of the few nuclear
weapons designers old enough
to have actually witnessed a nuclear
explosion
the 1962 weapon effects testing
operation
fishbowl a high altitude nighttime blast
over the pacific
this guy lit up like it was noon no
matter what direction you were looking
it just
lit up and it took about 15 minutes for
all the colors to
fade away how does the real thing then
compare with
the film it's amazing the difference
between what occurred out there and
what's on the film
as majestic and fearsome as those photos
appear
they don't come close not even close to
what you see in real life

Charles does find success entering the

a common pattern you find in UFC
fighters on a losing streak is going
down the weight class on an average day
Charles Oliveira weighs 180 pounds he
competes in the UFC in the lightweight
division that's 155 pounds after he gets
knocked out by Cowboys surrounding
Charles makes the decision to go down to
the featherweight division at 145 pounds
that's a 35 pounds weight
since most of that weight comes off in
water during fight week the perfect
method and timing is required to have
the right weight at the right time
Charles misses wait four times and even
Falls ill in 2014 due to a bad weight
cut as a featherweight he builds a

on the 6th of september 1992 a group of
hunters on the stampede trail near healy
in alaska came across an abandoned city
transit bus
thinking that it might make a convenient
shelter for the knights they ventured
inside only to be repelled by a terrible
smell that permeated the vehicle's
interior
suspecting the worst the hunters radioed
local police who came out and searched
the bus
they found the remains of a man who
would later be identified as christopher
mccandless
an individual with a fascinating life
and a legacy which has lasted for
decades after his death
christopher mccandless was born on the
12th of february 1968. even from a very
young age he was a bright and energetic
boy
he read widely with his favorite
literature being the stories of jack
london and mark twain
outdoor adventure was a common theme in
these books and also a massive part of
christopher's life
from as young as eight years old he took
part in hiking and camping expeditions
that would challenge children twice his
age
although there were happy parts to his
childhood it is clear that christopher's
relationship with his parents was not a
good one his siblings report that his
father was a violent alcoholic and that
there was often physical violence in the
family home
christopher's parents dispute these
claims
but even setting any domestic violence
aside christopher frequently found
himself at odds with his mother and
father
he abhorred their materialistic ways and
felt stifled by the vision they had for
his life
he complained that they were detached
from reality he didn't want to live the
comfortable middle class life they had
planned for him
he wanted to find his own more
meaningful path through life
by the time he turned 22 christopher was
determined to get away from home
after graduating from emory university
in georgia with excellent grades he
finally put his plan into action
without telling anyone of his intentions
he donated the vast majority of his
savings around 24 000
to the charity oxfam then burned the
small amount of cash he had left
he packed a few possessions into his car
a much-loved yellow datsun and set off
on a road trip across the country
for the next two years christopher
drifted from place to place enjoying a
life of freedom and adventure
he lost his car in a flash flood and
resorted to hitchhiking he spent some
months working on a farm before taking
off for the open road again
he kayaked along the colorado river all
the way to mexico and then was briefly
arrested when he tried to re-enter the
united states on foot
and through it all he left a distinct
impression on everyone he met some
people found his determination and
enthusiasm inspiring while others were
unsettled by his restless energy
throughout these years christopher lived
with very little money
he often foraged for food and would get
around by hitchhiking and stowing away
on freight trains
he tended to refuse offers of help from
other people preferring instead to rely
on his own resources even when this
caused him significant hardship he
repeatedly noted that he wanted to
escape from society and live his life to
the fullest out in the wild
during this time he went by an assumed
name alexander supertramp
in his journal he wrote a third-person
description of his new identity
two years he walks the earth
no phone no pool no pets no cigarettes
ultimate freedom an extremist an
aesthetic voyager whose home is the road
escaped from atlanta thou shalt not
return because the west is the best
and now after two rambling years comes
the final and greatest adventure
the climactic battle to kill the force
being within and victoriously conclude
the spiritual revolution
ten days and nights of freight trains
and hitchhiking bring him to the great
white north no longer to be poisoned by
civilization he flees and walks alone
upon the land to become
lost in the wild
the wild that christopher referred to
was alaska a place where he intended to
live off the land for a period of
several months
by april 1992 he had hitchhiked his way
there securing one final ride to a
trailhead outside the town of healy with
a local electrician
on hearing that he planned to hike off
into the alaskan bush the man became
worried by christopher's lack of
equipment and supplies and offered to
drive him into town and buy him more
equipment
christopher refused this offer but did
accept a sandwich and a pair of
waterproof boots
adding these to his meagre supplies he
marched off into the wilderness never to
be seen again
after three days of hiking christopher
came across an abandoned fairbanks city
transit system bus
the vehicle had been hauled out there in
the 1960s to provide shelter for
labourers building a road in the area
and had been abandoned when the project
fell through
after sitting empty for several decades
the bus was now to become christopher's
home
living off the land even with the
shelter provided by the bus wasn't an
easy task
christopher foraged berries hunted local
wildlife and at one stage even shot a
moose although he was only able to eat a
small part of its meat before it spoiled
a few months on with hunger setting in
christopher made an attempt to return to
civilization
only to find that the teclanica river
which he had easily waded across on his
way out was now swollen to the point
that he could not possibly cross it
he was he realized trapped in the
wilderness
tragically although christopher didn't
know it salvation was only a very short
distance away
just 800 meters or half a mile along the
river was a cable crossing that he could
have used to get safely to the other
side
unfortunately with no maps and little
knowledge of the area he would never
discover just how close he had been to a
possible way out
stymied christopher returned to the bus
and soon posted a note on the door
attention possible visitors
sos i need your help i am injured near
death
and too weak to hike out of here
i am all alone
this is no joke in the name of god
please remain to save me
i am out collecting berries close by and
shall return this evening
thank you chris mccandless
august
over the next few weeks he began slowly
to starve to death
there are various theories about how
christopher met his ultimate demise
some believe that he may have
accidentally ingested a poison that made
him too weak to forage
others that he simply couldn't find
enough edible plants or game
whatever the cause though in the end it
was a lack of food that ended his life
he kept a diary until the very end
writing a few brief words to describe
each day
his entry for his 100th day in the wild
paints a grim picture
day 100
made it
but in weakest condition of life
death looms as serious threat
too weak to walk out
have literally become trapped in the
wild
no game
there is no entry for day 113
it is likely that this is the day when
christopher passed away just 19 days
later hunters would stumble across his
body in the bus
the police would be cooled and by close
examination of his writings and
possessions the full sad story would
emerge
the death of christopher mccandless this
tragic narrative has been told the world
over numerous books have been written
and in 2007 the story was adapted into a
phenomenally successful film
many thousands of people have described
the way in which christopher's story
resonated with them noting how it spoke
to their desire to live more freely to
escape the constraints of society or to
reconnect with nature and the wild
at the same time his actions have drawn
criticism
some people including alaskan natives
who live near the stampede trail have
described him as foolish and naive
they point out how severely
underprepared he was to live off the
land and how his vision for his life may
not have been realistic given his
knowledge and abilities
there is nothing that illustrates
christopher's complicated legacy as
clearly as the bus in which he sheltered
during his time in the wild
it remained in place on the stampede
trail for several years after his death
during which time it became a popular
attraction for people who had heard
christopher's story
hundreds would hike out to visit it each
year writing tributes on the shell of
the vehicle and leaving behind objects
and messages in memory of christopher
mccandless
reaching the bus was however no easy
feat
and over the years many would-be
visitors got into difficulty while
trying to find it
some were simply under-prepared for the
hike and had to be rescued after getting
lost on the way out
others reached the bus but became
stranded in exactly the way that
christopher had with the river rising
behind them to cut them off from
civilization
in 2010 a visitor drowned while
attempting to cross the teklanica river
nine years later another tourist also
lost their life by drowning in the same
spot
by this time local police and rangers
were spending a significant portion of
their time rescuing people from the
trail and it was concluded that
something would have to be done about
the bus
in june 2020 an operation was mounted to
move the bus
it was airlifted off the trail and
transported to a safe storage location
before finding a permanent home in the
museum of the north at the university of
alaska
there tourists who admire christopher's
philosophy are able to visit the bus
without taking on the risks and dangers
of the stampede trail
the legacy of christopher mccandless is
an unusual one he was a fiercely
independent and courageous young man who
lived life by his own rules
but he was also extremely idealistic and
underprepared for what he wanted to do
something which ultimately sealed his
fate
his example tragic though it is has
proved hugely inspiring to many
but deadly to some who have tried to
live by it

BC Alexander the Great crushed the Hindu
Kush mountains and entered India for the
first time calling his veteran army to a
halt at the Indus River and demanding
that to rival kings in the region on
face and poorest come to him and submit
on face of tekzilla'
surrendered to Alexander but poorest of
perova resisted and forced Alexander
into a fight
Mattek battle at the hyde aspies river
which he won nonetheless wishing to
conquer all india Alexander marched
onward but his army mutiny dat's the
high fascist River and he was forced to
withdraw to Babylon their refusal to
march on was in part due to rumors of a
massive Indian kingdom possessing
innumerable legions further to the east
this was the Nanda Empire centered on
the magadha region which supposedly
fielded a colossal force of 250,000
infantry cavalry chariots and war
elephants though he had retreated
Alexander's conquests had destabilized
northern India a fact which would play a
key role in what was to come
once the historical shroud falls away
once again we see in 320 BC that it was
a man named Chandragupta Maurya who
stood victorious this Indian conquerors
origins are not clear but less favorable
Brahman sources state that he was a
sudra a peasant or serf whilst more
favorable buddhist texts designate him
as a member of the prestigious Kshatriya
or warrior caste he likely knew about
Alexander's stunning conquests and was
given a crash course in ancient warfare
tactics and geopolitics which he would
use to conquer his own empire having
gathered followers he initially attacked
the nanda empires capital but failed a
few times then he changed his tactics
and conquered the northwestern lands
which had been weakened by Alexander
using his subsequent control of these
prosperous regions to cut off supplies
to the capital resulting in the fall of
the nanda dynasty
after establishing his realm he fought
decisively defeated and made an alliance
with Seleucus famously gifting him 500
war elephants in exchange for peace and
the hand of seleucus daughter in
marriage
Chandragupta successor bindusara
continued his father's Weis domestic and
foreign policies such as his friendship
with Seleucus and his religious
tolerance in addition he thrust south
into the Deccan Plateau and expanded the
Empire it is the second of Bindusara
three sons who is the subject of this
video Ashoka whose eldest brother was
sue Zuma and whose youngest brother was
tisha it seemed as though the future
mauryan emperor at this point had no
chance of ever inheriting the throne for
one his mother supid Rangi was a
commoner while the crown prince and
favorite child
Susan burrs mother was a royal princess
nevertheless Indian princes were often
sent to govern faraway provinces and
Ashoka was no different at the age of 18
the young Mauryan royal was sent to the
cosmopolitan silk road hub of Taxila to
quell a revolt a task he supposedly
accomplished quickly the nature of
taxila as a scholarly and cosmopolitan
settlement where intellectual debates
were often had among different faiths
would have improved a shoka's knowledge
of the world as well as making him more
tolerant and sophisticated his next
appointment was at the important city of
Wu Jie capital of Avanti province the
high quality of the governorship that
Ashoka provided is shown by the fact
that he was entrusted with this station
that of administering a crucial region
connecting the capital city and the
coast it was in this new station that
Ashoka fell in love with Devi the
daughter of a trader interestingly she
was a member of the Secchia clan the
clan of Siddhartha Gautama the Buddha
himself it is widely thought that she
was a Buddhist upon bearing Ashoka his
two children their son Mahendra and
their daughter sang
this relatively peaceful life would come
to an end when in 274 BC emperor
Bindusara passed away what happened next
is the subject of much debate but it is
thought that a brief four-year civil war
occurred between Ashoka and his brothers
by acting decisively and swiftly
occupying the capital city and because
he was supported by his father's
ministers Ashoka reigned victorious over
his brother and was crowned as emperor
in 270 BC the same year Hannibal Barca
was born in Carthage after he had
ascended to the throne Ashoka continued
a policy of expansion and conquest one
of the reasons for this persistent
policy of warfare was that in this
period all Indian rulers wished to be
regarded as the chakra Vartan the king
of kings by their royal rifles practical
and economic reasons were also important
as taxes were the Maurine empires main
source of revenue the more land a king
conquered the more taxes he gained
however the more administrative and
military expenses would also pile up
leading to an endless cycle of violence
so it was that in the year 262 BC the
massive Mauryan army marched into the
kingdom of Kalinga their past successes
would likely have made them confident of
an easy victory but the king and his
army faced a tough grinding conflict
against a doggedly courageous enemy it
is said that Ashoka eventually won the
war not because Kalinga surrendered but
because the carnage was so terrible
after the final battle the victorious
monarch stood amongst his dead and dying
foes on the battlefield most monarchs
would have simply rejoiced in the grim
victory but Ashoka in this moment felt
horror and remorse it ended up being the
key moment of his life
supposedly 150,000 were there from
captured 100,000 were slain and many
times that died from famine and disease
more than just being horrified by the
direct results of the devastation he had
Ashoka also was acutely aware of the
tragedy that struck those left behind
the young sons left without fathers and
poor mothers who had been robbed of
their sons their families and loved ones
the educated and sensitive Ashoka
appears to have been made truly aware of
the real cost of war even admitting
publicly what no victorious ruler ever
had before
that he felt remorse on having conquered
Kalinga declaring that even one
hundredth or one thousandth part of
those who were slain died or captured in
Kalinga is considered regrettable by the
beloved-of-the-gods this was clearly not
the same man speaking who had
annihilated his brother and had seized
the throne by blood rather it was a
changed man finally admitting to his
mistakes and thinking on the futility
and tragedy of war henceforth said the
king he was not going to be provoked
into bearing arms again and also
dedicated his life and huge wealth
towards building a society where people
lived by the rules of virtue and good
moral behavior this abrupt change of
heart gradually led Ashoka to the
teachings of Siddhartha Gautama the
Buddha who had preached the same values
of peace non-violence and benevolence
two centuries earlier Ashoka had likely
known of Buddhism from an early age as
his wife was an adherent of the Buddhist
teachings and the faith was popular
within certain segments of the
population however he was the first King
in history to convert to this apparently
revolutionary religion contrary to watch
popular legends depict Ashoka did not
instantly convert to Buddhism after his
change of heart on the field of war but
thoughtfully and practically chose a
slow path which would benefit both him
and the welfare of his subjects
particular care was taken to remain
tolerant of the two other dominant
Indian
religions the Hindu Brahmanic faith and
Jainism in one of his major edicts
carved on a rock
he stated that should one blame other
religions or over glorify one's own
religion they are instead doing harm to
it an act which should not be done he
began to study under Buddhist monks and
two years later was accepted into the
Sangha the Buddhist Order his tutor was
a monk named PQ loopty of Mathura who
took the King on a pilgrimage of all the
important sites in their shared faith
such as lumbini where siddhartha gautama
had been born board gaya where he had
achieved enlightenment sarnath where he
had delivered his first lecture and
Kushinagar where he had died and gained
nirvana at all of these places and more
Ashoka erected pillars and carved rocks
with his edicts and royal orders these
proclamations were routinely read out to
the illiterate population by the
Empire's officials and appeared to be
personal messages from Ashoka himself
clearly in his own words it is also as
though the King's voice speaks to us
2500 years later when we read them today
his change in faith also changed his
role as the king rather than desiring
material gain which so many kings had in
the past
he now sought that his children obtain
every kind of welfare both in this and
the next world and dictated that
reporters could come to him with the
people's business wherever he might be
at whatever time despite all of this
piety and benevolence we must always
keep in mind that Ashoka was an emperor
above all else not a religious teacher
or a philosopher he had the duty of
running an empire and this was not
always a job which led to peaceful
outcomes there was a serious danger that
once Ashoka supposed pacifism had been
announced
the provinces would rebel and
neighboring Kings would invade sensing
weakness in the Mauryan leadership
however the emperor while he had given
up on aggressive conquest would
reluctantly but fiercely defend his
empire and refused to disband his army
every rebellion would still be put down
brutally and any foreign invader would
be met with devastating military force a
fact which he made clear to his own
subjects he also remained an almost
stern father-like figure benevolent and
caring but willing to inflict severe
punishment if necessary though his
engravings almost appear to plead with
his people not to force him to inflict
these penalties for example the forest
people or adivasi were told that despite
Ashoka's remorse he still had the power
and will to punish them for their
injustice 'as if necessary they should
he said be ashamed of their wrongs lest
they be killed
overall historian al bashyam stated that
while Ashoka could seemingly be a bit
naive he was still into fatigue herbal
strong-willed and imperious Ashoka also
worked hard to change the attitude of
his subjects not to force Buddhism onto
them but to spread his universally right
values the Emperor who had previously
enjoyed pleasure trips of hunting and
had wielded a mighty sword now went on
Dhamma atras or pious pilgrimage tours
during which he visited holy sites and
met his subjects he frequently talks to
local people to make sure they were
happy and would hear their compliments
or complaints about local officials in
this way he was the first Indian King to
think of the welfare of the poor rather
than just using them for tax revenue as
he stated the finest conquest is the
conquest of right and not might the
values he sought to spread were known as
Ashoka's Dharma a complex term which
essentially were rules of good behavior
in this particular context
for example Ashoka wished that people
would be obedient to parents and
teachers should behave properly towards
holy men relatives
servants friends and the poor and should
be kind and generous to the old and
vulnerable non-violence towards all
living creatures be they're humans birds
or animals was practiced one edict in
particular goes into detail about how
the Imperial kitchens will no longer
slaughter vast amounts of animals for
food in addition to preaching these
noble virtues to his people Ashoka also
sought to try his best to live by the
same tenets this was exemplified by his
thoughtfulness in the construction and
renovation of infrastructure he ordered
that shade trees be planted along roads
for shelter from the Sun and rains that
mango groves be planted in order to
provide food and that watering places be
dug to quench a travellers thirst in 253
BC a great gathering of Buddhist monks
was held as Pataliputra hosted by the
king himself at this the 3rd Buddhist
Council a momentous decision was taken
to send teams of big shoes Buddhist
monks to other foreign kingdoms in order
to spread the teachings of the Buddha
these missionaries are said to have
reached as far as Kashmir Cantara the
Greek Hellenistic kingdoms North Africa
Burma and Sri Lanka one of the travelers
was a man named Dharma Rex Sheeta and is
designated as Jana or Ionian in the
texts so it is possible he was a Greek
convert the most famous missionary of
the period however was Prince Mahendra
Ashoka's firstborn son in 249 bc
Mahendra journeys to Sri Lanka then
called Tamra pani at the invitation of
King Devan and Piatt Issa an admirer of
Ashoka and a man who wished to learn
more of Buddhist principles the
subsequent mission to this realm was so
successful that it gradually became a
Buddhist country and remained so even
today such was the legacy of Ashoka the
great
when he died in 232 BC he was 72 years
old and had reigned for 38 glorious
years though his death would instigate
the lung decay of his earthly Mauryan
Empire which fell after another
half-century Ashoka had ruled over the
largest indigenous Empire in Indian
history with wisdom efficiency and most
importantly compassion Buddhism in the
21st century is a world religion because
the first steps to spread it to the
world were made by Ashoka himself
gradually as the centuries progressed
after Ashoka's death the faith travelled
along the Silk Roads as far as Tibet
China and even Japan despite its decline
in the predominantly Hindu land of its
birth writer HG Wells stated that Ashoka
shines and shines brightly like a bright
star among the thousands of other kings

at the end of the video ever since the
israeli victory during the wars of 1948
and
1956 the arab coalition
led by egypt syria and jordan was eager
to change the situation in the region
by defeating israel both sides
understood that the conflict was far
from over
and were preparing for the next stage of
confrontation
international interference and the
inability of the sides to find a
settlement
made one of the most iconic conflicts of
the modern era
the six day war inevitable
on may 13 1967 the soviet union falsely
informed egypt about the concentration
of 11 to 13 brigades of the israeli
defense forces
with an intent to strike syria
in response egypt started concentrating
forces along the border with israel in
sinai
and on may 16 demanded that the un
peacekeeping forces
leave the peninsula at the same time
israel refused the request of the un to
deploy the unef
on their side of the border in the next
few days
egypt israel jordan and sudan started
mobilization of their forces
iraq sent expeditionary forces to jordan
and saudi arabia expressed its
willingness to participate in military
actions
but the turning point which made the
full-scale confrontation inevitable
was the decision of egypt to block
israeli ships
from entering the streets of tiran on
may 22nd and 23rd
on june 1st israel established a
national unity government
which on june 4 decided to go to war
the arab coalition of egypt jordan and
syria
had an advantage over israel in deployed
troops
with 240 000 against 100 000
in tanks with against 800
and in aircraft with 957
against 300 israel planned to strike on
june 5th
with operation focus which aimed to
destroy the egyptian air force
israeli media published false reports
claiming israeli soldiers were on
vacation
while their pilots were carrying out
training sorties as usual
their intelligence helped make this
training as realistic as possible
they also damaged the tracking antenna
of the us embassy
to prevent the americans finding out
about the operation
before the strike took place the israeli
pilots were informed about the start of
the operation
only five hours in advance at the same
time
the egyptian air defense system was
effectively off
on june 5th nearly 200 israeli aircraft
attacked 14 egyptian
airfields and caught them absolutely off
guard
338 egyptian aircraft were destroyed
and a hundred pilots were killed within
three hours
the jordanian and syrian air forces
attacked israel in retaliation
at 11 am on june 5th the response of the
israeli air force
was to attack their airfields which led
to the destruction of all
28 jordanian 53 syrian and 10
iraqi planes operation focus
was a decisive success israel lost only
19 planes in this operation
and guaranteed its total air dominance
for the rest of the war
the ground war was taking place on three
fronts
the sinai front the jordanian front and
the syrian front
on the sinai front the egyptian forces
consisted of seven divisions
four armoured two infantry and one
mechanized infantry
egypt had 100 000 troops and 900 to 950
tanks in the sinai
so israel concentrated three divisions
consisting of six
armoured one infantry one mechanized
infantry and three paratrooper brigades
for a total of 70 000 men and 700 tanks
along this
front israel's plan was to catch the
egyptians off guard
by attacking simultaneously with
airstrikes and attacking through the
northern and central routes in the sinai
peninsula
instead of the central and southern
routes used during the sinai war
on the 5th of june at 7 50 am the
northernmost israeli division
consisting of three brigades and
commanded by major general israel
tal started its advance towards arish
through gaza
with an aim to encircle khan yunus while
the paratroopers were ordered to take
rafa initially the egyptians offered
little resistance
since their intelligence concluded that
this was a diversion
rather than a main attack however
soon resistance against the 60th armored
brigade ramped up
this did not stop the israeli forces
from reaching the khan yunus railway
junction
in four hours afterwards the idf
advanced on shia zaweed
and defeated fierce egyptian resistance
thanks to air domination
the road to arish was open and by 8 am
on the 6th of july
elements of the 79th armoured battalion
and the 7th brigade
entered the suspiciously quiet city
suddenly the egyptians started firing
from the balconies and windows
and there was a heavy battle going on
for control of the city
the idf was only able to take full
control of the city
after reinforcements were sent the
northernmost division then split into
two parts
one of them continued the advance on the
suez canal
while the second group turned south and
captured birlafan
and jabal further south on the 6th of
june
the 14 000 man 150 tank strong
israeli 38th armored division under
major general ariel sharon
was confronted by the egyptian 2nd
infantry division
under major general saadi nagib
consisting of 16
000 troops and 90 tanks
israel successfully advanced towards abu
egala
the paratroopers landed behind egyptian
positions
and sowed enough confusion to weaken the
artillery of the egyptian defense
which opened the way for the idf to
capture unkatef
it was followed by a fierce close tank
battle which ended in an israeli victory
with 40 egyptian and 19 israeli tanks
destroyed
the egyptian forces in sinai were still
largely
intact but their field marshal abdel
hakim ammo
panicked and ordered the retreat of all
units from sinai
after hearing about the fall of abu
agala
this order did not elaborate on the
sequence and
manner of the retreat which only
decreased the defensive capabilities of
the egyptian troops
during the following days the idf
continued its advance westward
and inflicted heavy losses on the
egyptians
despite episodic heavy resistance by the
egyptians
as in bin gefgaffer the napalm bombing
by israeli aviation
and the uncontrolled retreat weakened
the morale of the egyptian troops
instead of catching retreating egyptians
the idf decided to capture three passes
from sinai to the egyptian mainland
and face the egyptian troops there
although the idf was not able to stop
all the egyptian troops from crossing
these passes became a killing ground
with ten thousand egyptians being killed
in one day alone the capture of sinai
was completed
by the fall of sham el-sheikh on june 7
and rasuda on june 8. on june 9
the un security council achieved
armistice between both sides
israel wanted to avoid confrontation
with jordan
and syria before defeating egypt but the
office of neutrality to jordan were
rejected
as the egyptian president nasa persuaded
king hussein of jordan
that egypt had an advantage against
israel
on the morning of the 5th of june both
sides started to fire
but israel attempted a last grasp
attempt to avoid confrontation with
jordan
by passing its message requesting peace
through the un representative
bull king hussein countered that it was
too late
and the jordanian air force was already
on the way
jordanian and iraqi aviation started
shelling israeli-controlled west
jerusalem
which caused 16 military and 20 civilian
casualties
with 900 buildings damaged israel
responded with its own air attack within
operation focus
which damaged the military aviation
infrastructure of jordan
and secured israeli air dominance
east jerusalem was controlled by jordan
at the time
and the jordanian army took position in
the un residency
the government house to fire on the
israeli sector
the jerusalem brigades reserve battalion
161 of israel
took the government house despite heavy
losses and forced the jordanians to
retreat to bethlehem
later on that day israel encircled
eastern jerusalem with the jerusalem
brigade from the south
and the mechanized herrell brigade and
55th paratroopers brigade
from the north a fierce battle took
place for ammunition hill
jordanian resistance was so strong that
the idf lost all but
two of their attacking officers and
achieved the goal
only after four hours the 55th
paratroopers brigade afterwards drove
eastwards
reaching mount scopus and defeating the
other jordanian positions around the
american colony
towards the evening of june 5th the
mechanized herrell brigade succeeded in
taking
let's run and ramallah also
the 163rd infantry battalion secured abu
tor
and cut the old city from bethlehem and
hebron
on june 7th the israeli minister of
defense
moshe dayan ordered the idf to enter the
old city
despite reservations and concerns by the
israeli government
the fighting was conducted solely by the
paratroopers
out of fear of destruction of holy sites
the idf took control of the old city
with little resistance
judea hebron bethlehem and nablus
were also captured by the idf on june
7th
remnants of the jordanian army fell back
into jordan
israel was victorious on this front as
well
syria also believed nasa about egypt's
early success in the conflict
and sent its aviation to attack galilee
this attack was intercepted by israeli
aircraft
a minor ground attack was also attempted
by the syrians
hoping to capture the water plants at
tel dan dan
and shiaya shiv this was repulsed by the
idf as well
israeli air domination lack of
communication by syrian units
and tanks being too wide for bridges
were among the causes of the
unsuccessful attack of the syrians
this caused them to abandon any attempts
to make ground offensives on israel
and airstrikes were chosen as their
method instead
however on the evening of june 5th
israel struck syrian airfields as part
of operation focus
destroying two-thirds of the syrian air
force and forcing the rest
out of the conflict the israeli
leadership was unsure whether to attack
syria or not
on one hand syria was using the golan
heights to
shell israel on the other hand it would
have been
a literally uphill battle against a
fortified enemy
but intelligence about weakened
positions of syria in general
and in golan heights in particular led
dianne to order an offensive on golan
without government authorization the
israeli offensive started with
air strikes which severely damaged the
defensive infrastructure
and morale of the syrian army
the eighth armored brigade led by
colonel albert mandler
advanced into the golan heights from
givert hayem
heavy fighting in unfavorable terrain
led to numerous casualties on both sides
but with the help of their aircraft the
idf ultimately captured the zora color
and einfit fortresses
in the central sector the israeli 181st
battalion
captured the strongholds of dardara and
talhilau
after fierce fighting by the evening of
june 9th
israel reached the plateau which allowed
reinforcements to join them
by dawn israel had eight brigades ready
for an assault on the second
line of defenses soon a ceasefire was
negotiated around the so-called purple
line
by the 11th of june all military action
stopped
up to 983 israelis 15 000
egyptians 700 jordanians and 2
500 syrians were killed in action
israel gained a huge victory it seized
the gaza strip
the sinai peninsula the west bank of the
jordan river
including east jerusalem and the golan
heights
about 1 million arabs were placed under
israel's direct control
in the newly captured territories the
israeli victory came as a result of
more efficient military leadership
better preparation of troops
and intelligence but the six-day war was
by no means the last conflict
and merely six years later the
confrontation escalated
into another war the sponsor of this

and we will catch you on the next one

on this particular episode we're going
to be talking about the response of
prophet or wise man John Chi H who was a
wise man to TV Joshua for I think about
over 15 to 20 years and this particular
episode I'm going to be doing it with
leadership bed Africa leadership yes sir
how are you so great to be back on the
show number number number one as I I
spoke to you guys we're going to be
doing a lot of collaborations so on this
particular episode we're going to talk
about John ch's response but there's
going to be another part that b is going
to post I'll put I'll leave it down in
the pinned comment on that video we're
going to talk about leadership you want
to tell them what we're going to focus
on yeah I think for me what's on my
heart is you know a lot of people in
this discussion you've got two groups
one group is saying No this guy has
passed away let's leave him then you
know and then there's another side of
the story is that there are people who
are hurt and there it seems to be a
thing that's continuing in our community
and it's not just happening in the
church we see even in the fake goas they
also abusing people there so what's on
my heart is how do you discern when you
are part of a cult what is a cult you
know those sort of things and I think
you're going to highlight in this video
as well that it's really about following
Jesus and about following the word and
not following people so that's what I'll
be looking at my brother awesome stuff
so on this video we'll talk about one
person's response and then we'll
highlight this particular element uh but
then the the further aspect of it we'll
deal with it on bat's videos all right
so uh leadership do you want to pop up
that uh video we're not going to play it
but I'm just gonna we're just going to
pop it up so please pop up the video
John Ministries that's the thumbnail
that actually highlights the the video
leadership do you remember particularly
what you were saying so uh he was
basically saying Prophet to be Joshua
was a father to him is somebody who
taught him the word discipled him so
he's not really coming out and saying
I'm defending him but he's just saying
this is who he was to me you know in
other words versus what the other guys
are saying he's saying I'm also a
disciple and he's basically say saying I
didn't see anything wrong basically yeah
yeah so if if a person is new to the
stuff this is how this guy defend okay
uh this is how these guys win each other
or win each other's following uh this
has nothing to do with whether this
person has seen anything or is given a
testimony about the character of the
person it's not otherwise he would have
posted this video yesterday or day
before yesterday or before then before
he post it right now when the trend of
the BBC comes out so that it can pick up
the people that follow TB
Joshua okay and so this is their way of
saying you know what to those TP Joshua
followers who no longer have a home come
to my
church new synagogue over here new
synagogue over here all of the people
that you hear coming out with these type
of things don't fall for it it's a trick
mentality they always do that
stuff absolutely and uh you know the the
guys are very smart because they're not
saying not addressing what other people
are saying but just talking from your
side but leadership you'll remember that
there was a scandal
withi Zacharias very recently as well
passed away and then when he passed away
a lot of people came out uh talking
about what had happened but I I just
found the response of the church like
synagogue of of Nations very different
to how the organiz ation of Ravi
zakarias responded so those guys what
they did is they straight away conducted
an investigation to find out if these
things are true or not and in fact his
daughter was the CEO of the organization
and she's the one who came out and said
we did an investigation and it turns out
that these things are true this is
somebody from the family so and then you
look at the response on the other side
the guys are just saying no it's
false they don't want to actually
investigate let some privately look at
these things you know yeah that's a very
good point because Ravi yo you know I
used to admire ravi's way of responding
to questions and what I be like yo this
guy is like there he's like there you
know and so when those things came out
they were very heartbreaking
definitely but then don't dismiss the
error of a human being uh investigate
ask questions what investigations have
these people done they've not done any
they've just come out and said you know
what this is common people always do
this you're so Superior to error to it's
just ridiculous leadership I think let's
back what we are saying with scripture
so First Corinthians chapter number
three verse one it says brothers and
sisters I could not address you as
people who live by the spirit but as
people who are still worldly near
infants in Christ I gave you milk not
solid food for you were not yet ready
for it indeed you are still not ready
you are still worldly for since there is
jealousy and quarreling among you you
are not are you not worldly are you not
acting like mere humans for when one
says I follow another and I follow
Apollos You Are Not Mere
humans and then he says what after all
is Apollos and what after all is Paul oh
only servants through whom you came to
believe as the Lord had assigned to each
his task I planted the seed Apollos
watered it but God has been making it
grow so neither one who plants nor the
one who Waters is anything but only God
who makes things grow I could not
address to you as antip spiritual so uh
if you've read uh First Corinthians
chapter number I think it's 2 Corinth
chapter number 5 verse 16 and he died
for all that those who live should no
longer live for themselves but to live
for him who died for them as was raised
again so from now on WE regard no one
from a worldly point of view though we
once regarded Christ in this way we do
so no
longer and then it goes on therefore If
any man be in Christ he is a new
creature so before he gets to If any man
is Christ he says we don't
regard those who are believers as in the
flesh and so when he says it it makes it
now a big deal when he says I cannot reg
you unto spiritual because you're still
functioning by moral no way Covenant
basically right we know that the noi
Covenant is the is the law that will
that will govern the judge J that God
gives unto all
men and so you're still functioning
under no Covenant ideas by by human
logic you're not you're not thinking
spiritually
God and so he says I have fed you then
he talks about why does he say this so
there's a certain teaching I gave you I
expected you guys to be living up to the
standard of what that truth
is
he says I I fed you with milk this was
my responsibility I did my
part and not with meat either he were
not able to Bear it he says if I had
given you difficult things I'll would
say you misunderstood and just never
ventured into it I gave you what was
fitting sure no it's hectic it's hectic
it makes it worse you know yeah at first
if he had given them difficult stuff
okay but he gave them simple stuff that
was meat for now why am I bringing up
this verse before we get to the part
where he talks about Apollo and
everything the reason why a lot of
people are
busy I I speak I stand with ti Joshua TI
Joshua is what T and this ones who are
also coming out and making their defense
of TV Joshua without sounding like
that it's because they never matured in
what they were given at first
absolutely so every single person has a
responsibility to the knowledge of the
Gospel that they are
given so that's why he says in the Bible
it will be worse for for you
than because those of Sodom did not have
the gospel the way it is plain for you
guys absolutely so degrees of judgment
goes with what was placed before you so
there are people in church claiming to
understand the scripture as leadership
and they don't understand you you can't
come out and speak of a human being
within that
light then he goes then he goes on and
he says for ye are wherein are there
amongst you strives ER Envy
divisions are he not caral and walk as M
men this way it shows you that he's
talking about people that are born again
then he says who is
Apollo PA what is Paul and
Apollos oh my God he's including himself
and he says who am I but just
vessel that conduct that spoke the
message to you guys it is God that's the
center absolutely leadership any
thoughts
yeah I think you've said it all and I'm
I'm trying to not go into what we're
going to say on our video because I can
see that the links are there but I think
you've already said it leadership it's
just who is Paul who is Apollo who is
Tip Joshua who is if you are putting
those people on the same L level with
Christ you've got a problem I think it
just calls on all of us to check how do
we relate to our leaders you know are we
putting them on the level with Christ or
is Christ exclusive that's a question
for all of us that that's what I would
say we need to really look look at at
that last point would be this
um people don't understand when we talk
about Systematic Theology you know the
thing that I like about the the way the
doctrine is laid out in Systematic
Theology is that there is the doctrine
of man so it tells you who is man what
is he where is he you know and when you
read Romans chapter number 7 it tells
you sin is dwelling in this issue this
is the this is the thing yeah that's by
the way that by the way is still
awaiting its day of redemption my spirit
is redeemed absolutely tame yourself
even Paul says you know I bid my body to
submission yeah Paul said that he said I
bring my body I am the one who's
dragging my body like a lamb to the
slaughter
to
submission amen so you don't know how
loose these people become and if you
allow one error it can corrupt a lot the
whole thing yeah you know and so just a
reminder you know as we are not we are
not your church
leaders no absolutely not all we are are
messengers social media you come across
our videos you pass and that's pretty
much it that's all our interaction but
bear in mind that these particular
voices that you are hearing and so forth
might be the last link for you to for
your area of conviction that area where
you become loose to allow
error leadership if I had error and you
defended me it would be a problem that's
a problem you're going against God yes
because now it's no longer that you know
Ricky is my friend no that's not the
issue you're going against truth if
Ricky does something Ricky must
understand the standard is truth
absolutely yeah and if Ricky does not
agree with the fact that leadership you
are rebuking him and saying Ricky you're
going into error
here if Ricky doesn't care on on the
standard of truth I would rather
distance
myself absolutely than to deny them the
of TR truth has a standard yeah
absolutely and a lot of people they they
mixmash this things and you know Paul
actually goes further in that when he
says H he says verse 9 of First
Corinthians chapter number three he says
we are laborers together with God that's
all we
are we are laborers with God now the the
that's why the the scone Church can't
even tell you till date this is how far
they want to to remove the humanity of
the men till date they have still not
told you what killed T Joshua
yeah because they can't have a man
preaching healing dying of sickness of
sickness yeah it projects weakness IT
projects weakness but then if you if you
understand we are in a fallen world we
are human yeah yeah what's what's the
wrong no Ricky they shot him yeah you
see he died violently no we in we in
human yeah he wasn't God yeah and so
this will then extend into B's video
where we're going to talk about this
idea of humans dis disappearing
completely and thing so y'all guys check
it out down in the pin comments and I'm
going check you out leadership do you
have any closing words no I just think
yeah for me my heart is still sitting on
on the fact that we as a church must
still look at at ourselves before we
preach the gospel outside you know
there's a sad story of uh you know zakus
trying to get to Christ and uh he's
prevented by the crowds you know he just
can't get close to Christ because the
crowd is in the way and so for me when
people don't come to God or can't come
to God because they are prevented by us
as the church the people who are closer
to God are the ones that are supposed to
enable people to come close to God but
yet we are the stumbling block you know
and and Christ says woe unto him who
causes people to stumble or people to to
go away from Christ so for me it's it's
really it's not even about TB Joshua to
me uh because I think like he was
talking about the doctrine of humanity
all of us are capable of being a TB
Joshua so how does one prevent
themselves from not going there and I
think it's for me it's living according
to the standard of the word the that you
elevate people and you elevate yourself
money power and all those things look at
what's happening with with even uh
Bishop TD Jakes it's the same thing you
know whether he's guilty or not what was
he doing at a party where people are
twering and all those things what
standard are we setting for ourselves as
the church like this verse you spoke
about where Paul says no man there's no
difference between you and the world you
are just doing the same thing following
the world and and and you're following
power and money but we have to be set
apart we have to be different so that's
where my heart is is what's stopping you
from becoming a t Joshua and I think
it's it's it's when we live according to
the standard of the word and really
apply it to our lives and and not just
play lip service but really are you are
you obeying Christ are you following
Christ or are you following people you
know what I'm saying yeah no let's make
an effort let's make an effort
change
something change something it it it

[Music]
louis if you win on sunday it will be
your record-breaking eighth title max if
you win it will be your first
[Music]
max has definitely been always on it
always on the top of his form where
lewis seems to be a little bit tired at
times uh the the saving grace for uh
mercedes and lewis is they don't pay a
high price for mistakes
you cannot forget that lyrics
had that opportunity to beat michael
or he's already the top of the top maybe
the top of the top of the top and i
think that's very important for him
to win this championship but max
he's trying everything he can i think
the first
title is something that uh
is the most important one because the
first i mean is just
put your name on the on the on the page
a lot has been made about how the
championship may or may not be won this
weekend do you have any concerns that it
may not be won fairly honestly i just
don't give it any energy i'm here to do
the best job i can with this incredible
team we never thought that we would be
neck and neck going into the last race
naturally the media
starts to say these things you know so
yeah i don't really have a lot
more to comment on that i think i
arrived here
just trying to do the best i can trying
to be the best prepared and and of
course actually trying to to win this
weekend i'm here to do my job and i
don't want to see the stewards
any more that they want to see me
second row for him max verstappen
crosses the line he's on pole
oh yes
didn't expect that one but amazing jump
guys
[Applause]
we've pushed the limits we've pushed
each other we've pushed our competitors
and i think you know here we are at the
final race for the showdown it's all in
for this sunday and whoever wins
deserves to win
the eyes of the world look to the
conclusion to hamilton versus verstappen
in 2021 two of the greatest drivers this
sport has ever seen are ready to put it
all on the line for the ultimate prize
in motorsport
all eyes now focused on the grid the
talking eventually has to stop the
wheels start to rotate and then it is
game on
[Music]
it's lights out away we go and hamilton
gets a decent start and he's already
ahead of max verstappen
hamilton leads into the first corner
this three of breasts going into the
turn nine headband oh near
and lewis hamilton almost coming
together hamilton has to go off the
track the dutch fans roaring in the
background yes he gets that back
back
yeah we're happy with the gap that
you've reinstated well we'll wait to
hear from michael massey all eyes on the
message board here in our commentary box
and what about the stewards are they
going to get involved 58 laps to run and
already on the first lap the two
championship rivals collide no
investigation necessary say the stewards
an investigation on the shortcuts all
the advantages that he's gained in terms
of caps
that is incredible
what are they doing here
go ahead jonathan so max is ahead of the
apex jonathan's on the track jonathan
he's forced him out there that's why we
asked him to give back lewis has he left
the track and i told him to get back on
the advantage all the advantage was
already given back prior to the first
lap ending
so the regulations say a 401 car must
not be any wider than two meters
and why do you think sergio perez can
make that red bull at the moment then
this could be checkmate for lewis
hamilton who's trying to get past the
honda power driver how tight is he going
to push it as tight as he can but he's
gone to the inside will perez throw it
back he will hammer to be aware yes he
is and look at this defensive tactics
this time he stays on the racetrack
hamilton gets the power down and
hamilton gets the race lead back perez
tried to hold him off but it's not been
by enough hamilton saw it coming and
he's gone to perez
inside and hamilton has to give it back
the problem that sergio perez is causing
hamilton is enormous here
perez paying back the team for all of
the faith that they showed him to give
him another he's basically not driving
off the corner here
this is extraordinary this is kicking
off ladies and gentlemen this is really
really big time because they're furious
with the move on the first lap like it's
a bit dangerous can you want
perez and hamilton in the 134s and the
133s the gap now coming down between
verstappen and hamilton you can see him
right in the background hamilton needs
to get past perez here he does get past
perez he moves towards the inside he's
going to force perez the long way round
if perez is going to try and retake that
lead of the race but on lap 21 hamilton
does get past perez but perez has played
the ultimate team game and he's really
brought his teammate back into play and
he can give his teammate a bit of trs
for good measure so great team play
that's the team play we talked about
earlier on now he gets clean out of the
way oh checkers
absolute animal
red bull are looking for something
beyond their control to try and help
bring them back into this race lewis
hamilton on course to become champion
you know the pace of the mercedes is
just too strong today so with yeah
but uh we're gonna need a miracle in
these last uh ten laps to turn it around
so uh he'll give it everything but
you know the clock's ticking
copy
[Music]
oh no nicholas latifi has crashed that
will be a safety car that's a safety car
because they'll not be able to recover
that and we've got a completely
different situation
so have a double yellow turn 14 entering
it now stay left stay left staying out
staying out
will we get any more racing laps or not
what jeopardy at the end of this grand
prix the end of this world championship
that's there's a yellow flags at 10 14.
latifa is completely in the middle of
the road debris all over the shop
so strap mode one strap
negative
coming into the pits max verstappen
hamilton stays out verstappen coming
into the pits
hamilton's a long way clear on the track
but i rather get the feeling by the time
he comes around to the main straight
he's not going to be able to pit and
stay ahead of max verstappen oh man you
love good meaning
there's four laps including this one
uh these back markers should get out of
the way they should unlock themselves
yeah they will once that message comes
through
what's the situation behind so situation
is that the staffing has pitted he had a
free pit stop we've lost track position
to him four laps remaining or when you
cross the line it may not restart is he
right behind me
he will be
once they've sorted out all the order
this is going to take a while to sort
out
with new tyres
and copy lewis we would have lost track
position if we had pitted
and lapped cars will not be allowed to
overtake which leaves verstappen with a
lot of work to do then
okay so stay online max those lap cars
are now being allowed to overtake stay
online let them go off the racing line
i'm not sorry cancel that black cars
will not be allowed to overtake
yeah of course difficult decision
it's classic
oh that's the price
mr michael yes go ahead christian yeah
why why are we getting these cars out of
the way and just give me because
christian just give me a second
okay my big one is to get this uh
incident clear
you only need one racing lap
that cars may well
will now overtake what is going on so
norris and alonzo and okon and leclair
and fettel
wow
i think all the cars ahead of you are
going to pass hamilton
everybody behind you will stay in
position
the safety car is in this lap max
that was so not right
this is unbelievable this is incredible
if you've never watched formula one
before if this is the day that you're
watching it's never normally like this
max verstappen is almost overtaking
lewis hamilton this is barely believable
this is it
this is it
we're gonna have one lap of racing to
decide the championship hamilton has the
advantage verstappen has the faster
fresher tyres and we've got
3.2 miles of racing action all the way
to the checkered flag
is it gonna be a first world
championship for verstappen is it gonna
be an eighth world championship for
lewis hamilton where can verstappen try
and get past hamilton first overtaking
zone it's normally down in the turn five
it's verstappen firing up back he's
gonna make
the championship trophy from lewis
hamilton who's trying to fight back
no drs for two laps so lewis hammer will
not get the rear wing open now he's
gonna go down the outside
if the stabbing keeps it tight and neat
but he hasn't he's got a little bit
worse
here comes lewis hamilton though down
the back straight he's got a slipstream
he almost touches verstappen they almost
make contact into turn nine verstappen
stays ahead of lewis hamilton of all the
drama of all the controversy of all the
magic moments in formula one in 2021 it
comes down to this and at this moment it
looks like it's gonna go the way of max
verstappen mercedes not happy red bull
will be delighted they have shared a
brilliant championship battle but the
championship could only be one by one
and it's going dutch in 2021 max
verstappen for the first time ever is
champion of the world
oh
you are the world champion the world
champion we are so proud of you
i've just speechless absolutely
speechless
you need to reinstate the lab before
that's not right
toto yes it's called a motor race okay
sorry we went to car racing
[Music]
so
[Applause]
[Music]
max verstappen you are a formula one
world champion
[Applause]
it's unbelievable i mean
well to my team i i think they know i
love them and i hope we can do this for
10 15 years together
there's no reason to change ever
[Applause]
[Music]
a big congratulations to max and to his
team um i think we did an amazing job
this whole year it's been the most
difficult of seasons and um this last
part of the season we gave it absolutely
everything and we never gave up and
that's the most important thing yeah
we'll see about next year
it just means a lot i mean it's my life
you know once you achieve your life goal
your life mission it's just something
truly incredible but also not only for
me but for my whole family because they
also had to live for me because my dad
was away a lot
it probably cost a marriage
and also my sister you know she missed
me she missed her dad
because my dad was always with me so all
of this now you know this hasn't been
for nothing
and that's something i which is very
special
[Music]
[Music]
you

It's interesting what happens with you when you're on the line.
Because it forces you to be in the moment. You're in such a specific and strange place
that your mind doesn't really comprehend what is going on, so
Whenever you're calm, the line is calm and the line will move with you.
But whenever you're stressed, the line will get really shaky and it will kick you off.
First of all, you obviously see a spot that you want to go highlining in.
you see an opportunity and you start preparing, you start thinking about
what kind of materials do you need to rig this line.
Because every single line is different and every single line has to be rigged different.
And I really already get into the zone when I'm in my gear shed.
I like rigging early in the morning, just because...
The only things around you are the trees the birds singing and, there are no people around.
You really get into the zone of being one with nature.
And then, when the line is there when it's all rigged and you're done
you can wake up on the line. You can start off your day so nicely.
So, about 10 years ago...
I got raped...
And I fell into a really bad depression and a post-traumatic stress disorder
with panic attacks and really depressing feelings.
And I was searching for something that challenged me again and gave me a purpose of life again. Because before...
I felt like every day was a good day to die.
When I found slacklining, I found something I enjoyed
I found something I was good at and it gave me confidence.
It gave me a purpose of living again.
And it didn't only give me confidence in the slackline world but also in the rest of my life.
It gave me confidence to live again and it made me comfortable with my body. 
Whenever you're on a slackline, your thoughts go blanc. There is no room for thoughts.
The good ones or the bad ones.
And, it made me feel free. I didn't have bad thoughts anymore.
I saw some people in the park slacklining, and I just asked them if I could try.
And from that moment on, it went really fast. I felt really comfortable on the line.
And about two weeks after I walked my first line, I went on a highline.
So when I was sitting on that highline, I felt really comfortable.
Even though it was shaking and I was high above the ground.
I was really scared of standing up because I knew I would immediately fall.
That was a process of believing in yourself knowing you are able to stand up and just walk a line.
It makes me so calm...
It makes me feel like I can do anything and I can conquer anything.

history is peppered with fascinating
facts about kings and queens who ruled
england who it's fair to say have had a
significant impact good and bad on the
world we live in history box is
currently taking a look at individual
kings and queens but in this video we're
going to whiz through history taking a
very brief look at 64 of them from the
wessex king egbert who was crowned in
802
right the way up to the current queen of
england elizabeth ii who was crowned
1150 years later before we get onto
egbert though let's take a brief look at
what came before more than 2 000 years
ago britain was occupied by several
relatively small celtic tribes then in
43 a.d the romans arrived and they
stayed for around 370 years before
leaving after that the anglo-saxons
arrived and established several rival
kingdoms these kingdoms existed for
around 400 years before one wessex
emerged dominant the aforementioned
egbert was one of the last in a long
line of wessex kings born in 770 he
ruled from 802 to 839 we're starting
with him because he won an important
victory against the then dominant
kingdom of mercier and so he set the
train in motion for the dominance of
wessex which in turn produced the first
english kings he was succeeded by his
son ethelwolf who ruled from 839 to 858
and was the father of one of england's
most famous early kings alfred the great
alfred was his youngest son though so
before he could take over his older
brothers ethel bald ethel bert and
ethelred ruled as wessex kings between
858 and 871 alfred himself ruled from
871-899
alfred's famous because at the time the
vikings had defeated most of the
anglo-saxon kingdoms and had almost
turned england into their own fiefdom
they'd already established danelore in
the north and were close to completely
overwhelming wessex and ridding england
of anglo-saxon kings once and for all
alfred stopped them
his son edward the elder who ruled from
899 to 924 defeated the vikings
conquering the southern part of dainlaw
edward's son ethelstone who ruled from
924 to 939 is our first king of the
english and obtained that title after
conquering danelore sending the vikings
packing and uniting all anglo-saxons
ethelstone didn't produce an heir so he
was followed by his brother edmund the
first who ruled from 939 to 946 and who
initially lost part of the north of his
kingdom before regaining it edmund did
produce a male heir called edwig but at
six years of age he was too young to
take the crown so instead edmund's
brother edrid reigned next from 946-955
after edward died edwig took over the
reigns ruling from 955 until 9-5-9 edwig
is famous for having fallen out with the
archbishop of canterbury at the time
after he had a threesome on the night of
his coronation with his girlfriend and
his girlfriend's mother yes you heard
that right edgar the peaceful came next
ruling from
959-975 and he's famous for being the
father of two english kings edward and
ethelred edward styled edward the martyr
ruled from 975 to 978 but was brutally
murdered at the age of about 16 after he
was stabbed sitting on top of his horse
the murderer was never captured and
there were rumors that his stepmother
was behind it after all edward's death
meant that his half-brother her son
ethelred succeeded to the throne ethel
read the unready as he came to be known
ruled from
978-1016 he dealt with renewed viking
raids by paying them off rather than
fighting them he also paved the way for
the 1066 norman invasion by marrying
emma of normandy she was william the
conqueror's great aunt something that
would enable william to later claim that
he had a legitimate right to sit on the
english throne though ethel read ruled
until 1016 in 1013 the king of denmark
swain forkbeard invaded partly in
revenge after his sister was killed in a
massacre ordered by ethelred swain had
himself crowned king of england and
ruled for 41 days in 1013 before dying
ethelred's son edmund ironside ruled
next in 1016. unfortunately throughout
his short reign he was forced to fight
swain forkbeard's son knude for the
crown and he died after just seven
months possibly of battle wounds after
that the way was open for canute who
reigned from 1016 to 10 35. canute was a
learned man and is known for having
ordered the tide back the sea washed
over his feet proving his point that
kings were not infallible canute's son
harold hereford reigned after he died
from 10 35 to 10 40. then kinute's other
son harthak newt ruled until 10 42
before keeling over a friend's wedding
and dying next ethel read the unready
son by emma of normandy sat on the
throne edward the confessor would be the
last king from egbert's house of wessex
dynasty and he ruled from 1042 to 1066 a
devoted religious man who was later
venerated as a saint edward ended his
reign childless and he's supposed to
have nominated william the conqueror as
his successor instead of william taking
over though a powerful wessex earl
harold godwinson stole a march had
himself crowned and ruled for nine
months in 1066 harold would be the last
anglo-saxon king to rule having
reportedly been promised the crown by
edward the confessor the duke of
normandy swooped into england and
defeated him at the battle of hastings
changing england's destiny forever by
installing a new norman regime and
ruling from 1066 until 1087. william the
conqueror's son william rufus or william
ii ruled next from 1087 until 1100 when
he was shot through his lung with an
arrow whilst out hunting after that
rufus younger brother was crowned henry
the first and he ruled from 1100 to 1135
his son william adeline drowned in the
white ship disaster of 1120 leaving him
without an air henry tried to install
his daughter matilda as his successor
matilda had married into a powerful onju
family something that would later lead
to a dynasty of plantagenet kings when
henry died though his nephew stevens
stole in ahead of her and had himself
crowned king plunging england into a
civil war as matilda fought to claim the
throne stephen ruled from 1135 to 1154
and he's the first of our kings to have
been placed in prison after being
captured by matilda's forces though he
was later released he was succeeded by
mathilda's son who ruled as henry ii the
first of the plantagenet kings from 1154
to 1189 expanding his empire into
ireland and deeper into france but also
causing a crisis when his men murdered
the archbishop of canterbury thomas
beckett henry's son richard ruled next
from 1189 to 1199 he was the crusading
king who led forces against the mighty
saladin during the third crusade to
reconquer jerusalem he was also captured
and handed over to a rival european
monarch and spent 14 months in jail
before being freed having produced no
children richard the first was succeeded
by his brother john who ruled from 1199
to 1216. john lost his father's lands in
france and developed such a bad
historical reputation it would lead him
to be cast as the villain in the robin
hood legends jon also fell out with his
nobles who forced him to sign magna
carta a legal document cited today as a
touchstone for all modern freedoms
john's son ruled next as henry iii from
1216-1272 like father like son henry
annoyed the english barons by favouring
french courtiers and proved fairly
useless on the battlefield the barons
forced him to sign the provisions of
oxford which created a council of
advisers to oversee the king's
administration henry iii son edward
ruled next from 1272 to 1307. edward the
first proved more effective and is
credited for having accepted the baron's
reforms and for calling the first ever
representative parliament to help him
rule however edward the first has a
terrible historical reputation as he's
also known for stripping jews of their
property and expelling them from england
and for suppressing scottish revolts and
killing the scottish independence
warrior william wallace edward's son
ruled next from 1307-1327
styled edward ii he proved unpopular
with the barons after promoting his
friend possibly his lover piers gaviston
he was also routed by the scots under
robert the bruce at the famous battle of
bannockburn which secured scottish
independence edward's resentful wife ran
into the arms of her lover roger
mortimer whose forces invaded england
and toppled the king edward was
imprisoned and it's rumored tortured and
killed by having a red-hot poker
inserted into his
his son edward iii ruled next for an
incredible 50 years from 1327 to 1377
though the black death devastated
england killing up to 40 percent of the
population his reign is considered a
success edward iii restored royal
authority and led england into the
hundred years war with france winning
important victories at cressie and
poitier edward iii son died too soon to
be king so instead the crown pastor
edward iii's grandson richard ii who
ruled from 1377 to 1399. richard ii was
only 10 when he became king so edward
iii's other son john of gaunt took the
reins initially helping the young king
through major challenges such as the
continuation of the hundred years war
and the peasants revolt of 1381 richard
later fell out with an exiled john of
gaunt's son his cousin henry
bollingbrook seeking revenge henry
invaded england deposed richard and had
himself crowned king henry iv henry iv
who ruled from 1399 to 1413 might have
stabilized the monarchy but overthrowing
king richard ii would later lead to the
war of the roses henry's son ruled next
as henry v from 1413 to 1422. henry v is
known for his prowess on the battlefield
leading his english army in a stunning
victory over the french at the battle of
agincourt in 1415 and coming very close
to conquering the whole of france henry
v was succeeded by his nine-month-old
son who was crowned henry vi and who
ruled from 1422 to 1471. thanks to his
father's successors he was also crowned
king of france though he was eventually
dethroned there and the war with friends
started again domestic troubles led to
poor henry vi having a series of mental
breakdowns culminating in the war of the
roses which resulted in him being
deposed by the son of his cousin richard
the duke of york who had himself crowned
edward iv though henry vi was eventually
restored to the throne edward iv killed
his son and heir and placed the ailing
king in the tower of london where he's
thought to have been murdered all this
means that our next king edward iv had
two reigns from 1461 to 1470 and then
again after henry vi was reinstated and
then died from 1471 to 1483. his 12 year
old son would subsequently reign as
edward v for just 11 weeks in 1483
before being disappeared by his uncle
and protector the dastardly richard iii
who would himself rule from 1483 until
1485. richard iii's reign culminated
with the invasion of england by a
distant claimant to the english throne
from the lancastrian branch of the
plantagenet family henry who had himself
crowned after richard iii was slain at
the battle of bosworth crowned henry vii
he ruled england from 1485 to 1509 and
established one of england's most famous
ruling dynasties the tudors having
stabilized the kingdom henry vii passed
the crown to his son henry viii who
during his 38-year reign from 1509 to
1547 famously married six wives
executing two of them in a bid to
produce a male heir he also initiated
the english reformation and separated
the church of england from the catholic
church in the process he was succeeded
by his nine-year-old son edward vi who
ruled from 1547 until his untimely death
in 1553 aged just 15. in that short time
the young king made his mark by
reinforcing the independence of the
church of england these efforts were
undermined by his older half-sister who
reigned next from 1553 to 1558 as mary
the first mary the first became known as
bloody mary for attempting to return
england to the catholic fold and for
sending dissenters to be burned to the
stake she was succeeded by her
half-sister the virgin queen the mighty
elizabeth the first who reigned from
1558 to 1603. elizabeth reversed mary's
attempts to re-establish catholicism in
england during her reign so famous it
was named the elizabethan age the
spanish armada was defeated the english
force is inspired by a stirring speech
she delivered on the eve of battle and
english literature and poetry flourished
especially under the penmanship of one
william shakespeare elizabeth produced
no children so she was succeeded by
james the first the great-great-grandson
of a previous king of england henry vii
james the first the first of the
stewards was already king of scotland
when he came to the english throne in
1603 and so he ruled both kingdoms until
1625 during james's reign the gunpowder
plot of 1605 a plan by english catholics
led by guy fawkes to blow up the house
of lords during the state opening of
parliament was thwarted james was
succeeded by his son who reigned as
charles the first from 1625 until his
execution in london in 1649. charles was
an unpopular king who tried to rule
without parliamentary oversight on top
of that he had a catholic wife and his
failure to provide aid to protestant
forces during the 30 years war in europe
fostered suspicions about where his
loyalties lay in 1642 the english civil
war broke out pitting round-head
parliamentarians led by oliver cromwell
against royalist cavaliers charles was
defeated in 1645 and executed four years
later for the first time england didn't
have a king a commonwealth of england
was established before the roundhead
general oliver cromwell ruled as lord
protector from 1653 until 1658 as well
as being a very capable military leader
cromwell is also known for his
intolerance of catholics and for the
atrocities he carried out in ireland he
was succeeded as lord protector by his
son richard cromwell who was weak and
ineffectual and spent just eight months
in office until 1659 when a council of
state was established to oversee the
running of england until charles the
first son could be brought back in crown
king he was and england became a
monarchy-led country again charles ii
reigned from 1660 until 1685. this
period of history is known as the
restoration and is characterized by a
sense of relief that england was back on
a steady course after the civil war and
by the music art and literature which
flourished at the time though he was a
bad administrator he was known as the
merry monarch and even became a people's
hero for his personal involvement in
trying to save london from the great
fire of 1666. despite having 13 children
non well legitimate so he was succeeded
to the throne by his younger brother
james who ruled from 1685 to 1688 a
catholic james ii was unpopular and was
deposed in the glorious revolution of
1688 when leading members of the english
political class invited the dutch
protestant william of orange a grandson
of charles the first to invade england
and take the crown william iii as he
became known ruled from 1688 to 1702
alongside his wife mary ii who ruled as
queen until her death in 1694. william
and mary helped to secure england's
status as a protestant parliamentary
democracy the couple didn't produce any
children so they were succeeded by the
daughter of james ii who ruled as queen
anne from 1702 to 1714. during her reign
the acts of union was signed merging
england and scotland into a single
sovereign state great britain
anne was the last monarch from the house
of stuart and died childless she was
succeeded by her second cousin her
closest living protestant relative from
the house of hanover george the first
who ruled from 1714 to 1727. under
george the first britain began the
steady transition from a country led by
a king to one led by members of
parliament notably robert walpole
recognized as great britain's first
prime minister george's son george ii
reigned next bonnie prince charlie the
stuart pretender to the throne attempted
to overthrow george ii in the last
jacobite uprising of 1745 the rebellion
failed george ii son frederick was due
to inherit the crown but died in 1751 so
instead frederick's son was crowned next
and styled george iii he ruled for an
incredible 60 years from 1760 right the
way through to 1820. george iii is
perhaps best remembered as the king who
lost britain's american colonies in the
american war of independence also during
his reign napoleon was defeated and the
transatlantic slave trade was abolished
in 1807. george iii is also thought to
have suffered from a severe mental
illness allowing his son to step in his
prince region george iv eventually
graduated from prince region to king he
built buckingham palace and presided
over the emergence of the british empire
as a dominant world force george's only
legitimate child charlotte died before
him in 1817 so when he himself died he
was succeeded by his younger brother
william who reigned as william iv from
1830 to 1837. william iv inherited the
throne when he was 64 and had led a full
life before then he'd served in the
royal navy was known as the sailor king
and cohabited with an actress with whom
he'd had several children william was
succeeded by one of the most famous
monarchs in british history queen
victoria victoria reigned from 1837
right the way through to 1901 and
presided over a period of industrial
scientific and cultural change the likes
of which had never been seen before in
britain or the world victoria was
succeeded by her son edward vii who
reigned from 1901 to 1910. after edward
or bertie as he was nicknamed came
george v who sat on the throne from 1910
to 1936. during world war one the house
of saks coburg and gotha was deemed too
german sounding and so was changed to
the house of windsor george v was
succeeded by his eldest son edward viii
who sat on the throne for less than a
year when he stepped down he was
succeeded by his younger brother george
vi who reigned from 1936 until his death
in 1952. george vi is remembered for his
radio broadcasts which boosted morale
with the british public during world war
ii and that brings us to the current
queen george's eldest daughter elizabeth
ii who was crowned in 1953 and in 2015
became the longest-serving monarch in
history elizabeth ii has presided over
some huge changes in the 20th and 21st
centuries from the dissolution of the
british empire to the cold war we'll end

1815. Napoleon has been defeated.
During his time as the French emperor, he had redrawn the borders
of the states in Italy to look like this
after the Vienna Settlement they were changed to this mostly to what they had been before
except that the Austrian Empire was given to control to
 
The Austrians were basically
 
 
 
 
The most notable of these ideas being that the Italians should see themselves
as a single people and dismiss any foreign intervention.
Naturally, this upset the many
 
earning them the title "reactionaries." The years following the Vienna
settlement were troubled with unrest
with many liberal thinkers forming secret society, such as
the Carbonari in the South. In 1820 and 1821,
a series of revolts and coups were launched across the Italian state
in order to force through liberal reforms.
In the Kingdom of the two Sicilies, there were two. With those in Naples
calling for the introduction
of a new constitution and those on Sicily demanding independence
for the island.
Basically, no one in these revolutionary movements could agree
on anything. And the Austrian army, soon after, come down and crush them.

head coach of the Tottenham Hotspurs and
I'd like to talk to the Queen please my
name is Ted lass so I'm new head coach
for Tottenham Spurs and brought over
here to you know implement my coaching
style footballs football no matter where
you play it yeah grass you got cleats
and you got helmets with masks on
football in the states is my specialty
but they have a different kind of
football over here yeah yeah
Circle them up haven't put on their pads
let's start playing for real they're
wearing their pet coat there's a lot of
a lot of small similarities a team I
coach they're gonna play hard for all
four quarters okay what's that - okay
hams it won't play hard for two halves
now we're gonna play till there's a
winner there's a loser what's that okay
there's a winner a loser or tie you can
tie if you tried to end a a gaming of
time in the United States heck that
might be listed in Revelations as the
cause for the apocalypse yet we have any
goals this season absolutely go and win
a lot of games we're gonna get in the
playoffs
there's no playoffs again my job has got
a lot easier ties and no playoffs
why don't even do this one of the issues
I've had is what tackling was that's not
a tackle it's just sliding around soccer
tackle sir that's how you tackle to
prepare for this job you know read a lot
of books watch a lot of game films but
to be honest with you the best way to
learn how to play this game is to play
this game the square goal second second
stall see I got you those who don't you
don't know what to do there you go just
stop okay it's over for now 15 nothing
huh we're going going remesh yeah they
do things a little bit differently army
to find some of the things they do a
little silly but Pasadena like keep
passing it backwards what's going on
here it's nice to be able to go
backwards and forwards and not have some
ref make a big deal about you explain me
how that was offside no I'm asking you
seriously
explain offside of me ain't no sense
well the first thing I had to do and
getting this job is learn about the
competition we came up with flash card
system in order for me to make American
comparisons to English teams all I had
to do is link what I don't know to what
I dunno Manchester United
super-rich everybody either love them or
hate some Dallas Cowboys Liverpool used
to be great haven't won a title in a
really long time also a Dallas Cowboys
Cardiff City dragons on the crust
was that hot girls nine from Game of
Thrones Khaleesi Khaleesi Manchester
City Jennifer Lawrence West Ham United
pickup trucks because of that training
that I did I guarantee that we're gonna
beat the Cowboys and the Cowboys and
Jennifer Lawrence has there been a
learning curve I would say a little bit
sorry I understand why were you so but
looking out tying these goals are oh the
practice coach coach he knocked that
ball of his head not legal
totally legal points no points no points
why not gotta go in come on Rob you got
get it in there to get three points one
point they got like an application for a
phone I can learn the rules with these
trust exercises who's uh orange Shuster
Gareth Bale as Gareth Bale where he's
from he's from England Wales Wales wait
that's another country yes and no how
many countries are in this country for
but but I'm learning and and I want to
learn these young men I just would not
understand exactly what I was trying to
get him to do guys all I'm looking for
is sixty percent effort four thousand
percent of the time that's a skip skip
like middle girls do not acknowledge
care in the world I'm lucky to be doing
this for a living
everybody's do the robot you got to ride
a few players a little bit harder than
some of the other players blondie you
are killing me John what do you got on
their pants lies what is those three
quarters and I get those in the women's
section John
pick up the ball pick the ball of your
hands that is a violation and an act of
solidarity I spent an entire day not
using my hands out of respect towards
the game and I think that went pretty
well I think it garnered a lot of
respect from the players they appreciate
not only the fact that I could do most
activities without the use of my hands
but that I just tried after a few days
of practice players gaming nicknames
started small but if now they'll chanted
a B every now that's pretty nice what's
the nickname
wanker jenos means I think it just means
great I just like a nice guy like you
know kind heart you know someone that
listens someone gonna push you a wanker
is it someone who did there's a mine
being alone you know likes to sit with
his thoughts well with a new job you got
to anticipate a learning curve I'll tell
you what I'm in Tottenham and I'm here
to stay you can guarantee that once a
here oh no I got fired Premier League is
on NBC and the NBC Sports Network live
on TV online or on the go is there a
third kind of football maybe I could
look into

nshed's roombeek neighborhood is known
as a less upmarket part of the city near
the eastern border of the netherlands
far from the eyes of authorities
working-class families are living in the
tight-packed affordable housing
on a sunny saturday afternoon in may
2000
the residents of roombik are gathered in
the streets wondering where the cloud of
black smoke is coming from
they seem surprised to hear there's some
sort of production facility right around
the corner
little do they know that living
standards in the neighborhood had been
so low that a fireworks factory was
allowed to operate nearby
out of sheer curiosity the entire
neighborhood goes out and clogs the
street
suddenly roombeek looks like a festival
is going on
the smoke coming from the factory yard
also catches the attention of local
firefighters the immediate response crew
arrive at the scene in minutes but are
blocked from approaching the factory by
hundreds of onlookers
the crowd is deft their pleas to clear
the way as everyone wants to be in the
first lines to see the show
the police have to intervene and push
the people away from the scene
as soon as the path is clear the
firefighters waste no time rushing
straight into the smoking factory yard
danny devries a young cameraman from the
neighborhood is here to capture the
event
having both the street and the smoke
rising from above the rooftops in his
frame he finds himself in an ideal
position
a burst of fireworks into the sky
followed by an explosion suddenly breaks
the generally joyful atmosphere on the
streets
suddenly everyone is awake and alert
whatever is inside that factory is
dangerous and might threaten their lives
while the sound of whistling fireworks
crackles through the air and small
rockets fly all over the place the crowd
flees from the scene devries stands
calmly and records it all
then out of the blue a powerful
explosion knocks him off his feet his
camera is still recording but nothing
can be seen except for a thick smoke of
dust that falls in the neighborhood
the dust settles after a couple of
minutes and everyone recovers from the
shock
instantly the streets of rumbik turned
into scenes akin to a disaster movie
the level of destruction caused by the
explosion indicates the factory was not
an ordinary one
the center of the explosion is the se
fireworks factory one of the leading
firework suppliers to major festivities
in the netherlands
the roomba compound was established in
1976 when the area was already in
urbanized zone
the original facility comprised of a
workshop and 13 storage cells designed
to accommodate 18 tons of fireworks
in 1996
factory owners increased the storage
capacity to 105 tons and two years later
to 159 tons
at the time of the disaster the se
fireworks storage capacities comprised
of 13 bunkers within the central
compound that were built of reinforced
concrete 16 steel containers seven light
concrete boxes and two large hangers
obviously the factory accommodated quite
a large amount of explosive material
which was not unusual considering the
company's high turnover
the problem was that it was just a few
yards away from a residential area
on may 13 2000 at 3 03 p.m
a local fire station received a call for
intervention in the roombeek
neighborhood a fire had broken out in
the fireworks factory and neither
neighbors reporting the fire nor the
firefighters knew what kind of factory
it was
when they arrived at the scene at 308 pm
firefighters noted the ignition of
pyrotechnic material that likely caused
the fire with those sorts of fires being
hazardous the fire brigade called for
reinforcements
they knew it would be a tough job to
keep the fire under control luckily
since it was a saturday there were no
employees inside the factory
the firefighters located several
ignition spots within the main workshop
the fire had quickly spread through and
out of the central compound reaching
facades and the roof of nearby hangars
at 3 28 pm the fire reached steel
containers starting with the one
designated e-2
six minutes after it was set ablaze
container e2 exploded sending many of
the fireworks into the air which
onlookers witnessed from outside
meanwhile the situation inside the
factory facilities grew worse
the fire spread out of control and
firefighters were forced to abandon
their positions and run for their lives
inside the yard was also local
photographer marcel van neuenhofen who
was trying to get a close-up shot from
the fire from container e2 the fire
spread to concrete boxes which began to
explode in sequence
the explosion created a 280 foot
diameter fireball and a pressure wave
equivalent to the explosion of one
thousand seven hundred pounds of tnt
the blast destroyed the doors on the
other storage units which were then
caught by the raging fire followed by a
massive explosion of the entire lot the
epicenter was cell c11 within the
central compound the force of the blast
was evaluated to be equivalent to the
explosion of four to five tons of tnt
it created a huge fireball 440 feet in
diameter the blast was heard within a 9
mile radius
the explosion at the se fireworks went
on to destroy the entire area around the
factory 100 acres in total
400 houses were utterly demolished with
another fifteen hundred damaged fifteen
streets were burned to ashes
firefighters from nearby towns as well
as from across the german border arrived
at nshed to help responders battled the
blaze throughout the neighborhood the
entire day
the fire also consumed the facilities of
the nearby gross brewery with an
asbestos roof releasing the harmful
compounds into the air
throughout the weekend an apocalyptic
scenes rescue teams searched the debris
for survivors
23 people were found dead among them
were four of the first firefighters to
arrive at the scene
marcel van newenhofen the daredevil
photographer was also killed in the
explosion
at the media spectrum 20 the ensched
hospital
974 people were treated for injuries
50 of them were in a serious condition
and were kept for further treatment the
disaster had a devastating influence on
the state of health of both victims and
survivors especially those that lost
their homes
many of them suffered from insomnia
anxiety difficulty coping with
day-to-day life and a lack of
self-confidence for a long time after
the disaster
the material damage was enormous an
entire neighborhood was wiped out the
remaining houses were evacuated and
demolished leaving more than fifteen
hundred residents homeless
the damage was estimated to be 486
million dollars
dutch prime minister vim koch and queen
beatrix of the netherlands visited the
scene promising that the entire nation
would back up rebuilding the destroyed
neighborhood
by all accounts the ensched fireworks
explosion was an unprecedented tragedy
in the town's history only comparable to
the allied bombing in 1943
it caught the whole country's attention
curious to know how it happened as a
result a board of inquiry called the
usting commission was set up to
investigate the circumstances that led
to the disaster
the inquiry was based on three
hypothesis
the fire was caused by human error while
handling fireworks
it was caused by self-combustion of
explosive material in the workshop
or the fire was set up by a pyromaniac
as there were recent arson cases in the
area
six days after the tragedy the
authorities issued an arrest warrant for
the company's two owners rudy bocker and
willie pater
since the factory had a multitude of
safety issues the two were marked as
prime suspects
when the police arrived to execute the
warrants both were gone however that
same day peter turned himself in to the
police followed by bocker the day after
inspectors in charge of the
investigation questioned them over the
number of irregularities in the way
fireworks were stored at the facility
at the epicenter of the explosion the
central compound workshop there were
almost two thousand pounds of fireworks
despite it being an off day at the
factory according to regulations if they
were not being operated with they
weren't allowed to be in the workshop
but should instead be stored in storage
facilities
additionally is problematic was that the
factory housed more explosive material
than allowed and that there were types
of fireworks inside the factory that
they had no authorization to store
in general fireworks are classified into
four hazardous categories according to
their potential to cause accidents
these are
hazard type 4 fireworks they present a
low fire risk
type 3 fireworks have a fire hazard and
minor blast and projectile threats
1.2 g fireworks present a serious
projectile hazard but does not have a
mass explosive risk
and finally the most dangerous category
type 1 comes with a very high hazard
with the potential of mass explosion the
sc fireworks were authorized to store
136 tons of type 4 and 2 tons of type 3
fireworks instead inside the storage
containers and boxes there were only 16
tons of type 4 fireworks and 153 tons of
type 3 fireworks
5 tons of type 2 and 1.6 tons of type 1.
that was more than 160 tons of
unauthorized hazardous materials stored
near the residential area
furthermore there was a series of issues
regarding the safety of the storage
capacities the most obvious was the
inappropriate layout of containers and
concrete boxes in the factory yard they
were packed tightly with no separation
distance between installed earth walls
or any other form of partitioning
prescribed by regulations
two containers were not even supposed to
be there and were not authorized
none of the storage facilities went
through any kind of testing and had no
appropriate detection and fire
extinction devices
in addition the aerial photos of the
compound taken a few days before the
explosion showed the container doors
were left open if that was the case on
the day of the disaster it surely
enhanced the spread of the fire from one
container to another and the resulting
domino effect explosion
ironically just a week before the blast
the factory had been inspected and
determined to have met all official
safety regulations
the safety irregularities still didn't
explain how it came to the explosion
human error was the less likely cause
since there were no workers inside the
factory on that day self-combustion of
the explosive material left in the
workshop was also a less plausible
scenario even though it was a warm and
sunny day the temperature inside the
workshop was far from enough to cause
self-ignition
if it happened an electrical short
circuit from some devices could have
been more likely
one of the arrested owners rudy backer
tried to defend his case by claiming it
was arson
according to his claims the previous
owner of se fireworks harm smallinbrook
had the financial motives to organize it
smolenbrook had sold the company to
bocker and peter on april 27 1998 but
had remained the owner of the land and
buildings which he rented to new owners
under the articles of the buyout
contract
bocker claims smallinbrook had plans to
sell the land to the municipality but
had to get rid of his tenants somehow
the arson seemed like a good choice
indeed the police arrested 34 year old
andre devries accusing him of setting up
the fire in sc fireworks on may 13 2000
but with no connections to smallenbrook
whatsoever even though devries
persistently claimed his innocence in
may 2002 the court sentenced him to 15
years of prison
the verdict was based on witnesses
testimonies traces of powder burns on
his pants and his statements
as it later turned out devries was right
about his innocence
in 2003 the appeals court acquitted him
of arson and released him from prison
the final report of the usd commission
was released on february 28 2001. the
conclusion was that the factory owners
quote committed a number of serious
offenses in terms of pyrotechnic
materials management equipment from
various structures and the use and
location of inadequate structures
as far as the responsibilities of the
local and national authorities were
concerned the commission only proposed a
series of improvements to the system
on april 2nd 2002 a dutch court
sentenced the owners of the se fireworks
to six months for importing and selling
illegal fireworks breaking safety codes
and violating storage licenses
they were also fined two thousand five
hundred forty dollars each for violating
safety regulations however since they
had already spent three months in remand
and had their sentences suspended for
three months they were walked out as
free men
a more serious charge of negligence for
the fire was abandoned
years after the disaster and the trial a
famous whistleblower paul van bouterden
conducted an investigation of his own
he initially claimed inspectors did a
poor job leading the investigation but
then suggested the whole thing was a
huge government-led cover-up
as stated in his reports two detectives
claimed there were problems with the
official investigation
these claims were rejected but the
detectives were fired however an
internal police investigation shows the
detectives were right but the report
about this investigation was never
published
then bouten further reported that the
official information regarding the
unauthorized powerful fireworks in the
storage was based only on a
reconstruction of the disaster by the
dutch forensic institute nfi and tno not
on actual evidence
he concluded that both the investigation
and the report of the usd commission
were made to conceal the authority's
responsibility
nevertheless the government and the
local authorities did their best to
respond to the disaster and rebuild the
roombeek the government offered
substantial financial backing for
rebuilding the neighborhood while the
ensched authorities organized the
execution of the rebuilding plan
aware of their responsibility for the
disaster the local council had no direct
participation in the decision-making
process
but gave over the job to residents of
roombeek
those who suffered the most were able to
decide what the neighborhood would look
like
local authorities were only there to
catalog their opinion
in the end the hopes and wishes of the
public were turned into reality at
amsterdam's p de brown's design roombeek
has been rebuilt into the same warm
neighborhood it once was
at the location of the former fireworks
factory the epicenter of the disaster a
part of the original factory cement
foundation that was destroyed by the
explosion was left in place to be
overtaken by nature although they say
time heals all wounds it will take a
long time to heal the traumas of the
people who survived one of the most
devastating accidents in the recent
history of the netherlands

pretty pretty uh sad for us because it's
our it's our own game american football
[Music]
we're at the regional trial program for
uh the under 19 u.s national team we
have 150 athletes they've traveled in
from california alabama louisiana to
this football field to compete against
each other for a spot on next year's
roster our fundamental strategy here is
pretty straightforward we're looking for
the top right players we talk about that
all the time internally it's important
to find guys who have the talent and the
skill a lot of kids do around the
country but then you add in the
discipline and leadership and ultimately
the character and that's what equates
the top right players and that's
ultimately the type of kid that we would
ultimately want on team usa well number
one the attitude has been a plus and the
talent level the most of these young
guys are all juniors to be seniors and
they are all very gifted it's a very
very
uh equal competitive situation but the

we carry forward in our life every day
and it's something that is truly special
about this game

[Music]
you know in running there are three
things that but you really need lesser
as an athlete you know you need strength
you need endurance initially when when
when you have not grown to understand
why you're doing it they feel like
torture now especially when you're in a
groove and then they static I had to
suffer in the track then there is that
feeling the pain again before you go but
once you understand why you're doing it
and then how it impacts on your
performance then I'm gonna push you you
begin to enjoy them
precision seems not to be important at a
marathon us and that the people see so
seems not even official but to my team
is really crucial it's beneficial to us
first is that it tells us to make our
per to maintain the eye base that's the
main thing and the second is that it
actually opens the whole politically to
feel how hard training is it makes you
run in a smooth way can flow in a good
way make sure and when were in a long
run it makes you a curry move swiftly
because I have equalities continua
ported to to I speak with the same
rhythm but maintaining that time until
the transition is haw
you know practicing because you can run
constantly on high-speed because if you
do if you say let's say if you do 33
minutes on like fartlek something you
have hills or there are some stones and
going down with a lot of group so you
don't maintain high speed while track
you can run every love like the FEI 16
68 68 68 or 70 70 70 so that that speed
it opens your legs and then the longer
nose you see is much easier
the far leg is much faster again so it's
really important I think to to have
structures actually it was my worst
training always so if every time when I
know how to Taurus Tuesday as I don't
know because to run constant cross when
you're always difficult even in
marathons are like sometimes literally
let the group go and then chase them
again and so that chasing give me energy
but we have to run like like a robot it
was very difficult always but the last
actually last year the last two seasons
I'm able to stay in front do my part
also to pace the group ones and to run
actually good instructor and then I saw
when I change that mentality
I was running much faster than America
ideally you know when you're writing a
program we profile athletes so the the
profile of acting is that you are
dealing with gives you what packets you
should put in your speech session
training so let's say an athlete with
jacketing to 2 hours 3 minutes for
example you know so you you you you do a
range of from that key top group to the
people who are also running 2 to 10 to 9
then do a range so that you know your
training program will capture in the
interest of the athlete running 2 or 3
to the one running 2 to 9 to 10 if you
are training with your a camera or
injured and your enough coming at it and
then you post yourself to stay with them
then naturally you're killing myself
so we always encourage people just to to
know themselves understand their bodies
so that when they go for training they
are taking their position they are not
following and/or posing themselves to
fit into the position over anybody else
that's what we calculate in them and we
time it's not something that happens
instantly but we time they'll understand
we always encourage them to pace
themselves be it in you know speed
sessions on the track or in the long run
you know you need to know how to balance
your energy side that you know you
finish the training you know
[Music]
yeah the good thing with track session
is that as we do repetition even if
somebody is dropped with one repetition
then you can go in front in the next
repetition so we try to to put somebody
else in the front to place I can start
with placing the first 1000 then another
guy take the second 1000 and then
continuing like this and that's why it's
really nice to be a group when you go
for a track session on my own it would
be very difficult I mean the motivation
you get from the booth is is uncountable
like even when you are exhausted you
have one guy in front of you to to to
pace you to push you it's it's really
helping and I think sometimes when you
are tired you cannot think so straight
and you you you will feel unmotivated
for the next wave but if you have
someone you have no choice
kind of nervous before transition I
always want to to reach the time that my
my coach is sending me and sometimes I
know it's it will be tough but we have
to do it there is no choice here coach
will fade not take over this so people
don't push too much the person in front
of you is not it's not like
a gap is there's no gap to the other guy
you're gonna have to pass coming thrown
just stay where you are so if you see on
the video we're gonna like a long train
so the first if it is 10 times 60
nanometers that first 10 people will do
the first of guy will do 60 non-material
go back
number 11 now and then the one was
number two he would take it over later
and like that so sometimes you see like
some people take a type I want to skip
it because EULA is play your position
it's your turn to do technical we like
to help each other as a team and but
also don't express it because it's the
code let it go you know someone who may
feel nice today and say let me 6262
instead of 68 so we want to run like
constant actually that's the only train
that coach controls is like
[Applause]
[Music]
as a certain point the matter can be
also a sprint competition so that you
know reputation sessions speed workers
it can help you like that
it doesn't matter if it is a 80
kilometer or 30 kilometer or 42
kilometer you need it somehow somewhere
so you have to be capable of doing that
[Music]
yeah sometimes I have a 2 times a week 2
times the speed work sometimes I work in
the like like today force will work one
time I go to in the trash so choose one
one week I go to pull the truck one week
I came to filete this kind of places so
like this way sir is very necessary
fantastic also sometimes I go to foreign
and the truck like I'm suppose to do
just combining for both places like this
place in like four truck so it's it's
depend of two youth program is different
once it's the speed work and the reason
why we do track workers it makes the
other work easier so if you have if you
have that fast training on the track and
you go to the long run it feel way
easier and that's the most reason I
think rather feeling every time I do
track and the next time we're going to
further like a long run it's way easier
and I think that's the secret that way a
lot of model renders feels sometimes
track athlete think every athlete have
some days that you don't feel 100% so
it's always great to have someone who
feel 100% and to push that limit and
yeah we motivate each other and we help
each other to make the heart work easier
[Music]
if speed is very important because look
sometimes you have to keep
advance advance advance means if you are
going it run let's say marathon at 250
you need to maintain a speed workout and
you need to cover speed may be difficult
you have to run faster if you trade
maybe on the speed to 42 minutes 40
seconds if you have seconds
so that means not
tragedy just relax you know especially
doing training on on attitude going
silly wheel you know you get much
advantage
easily you can catch up the pace and
running relax it actually we are
following a program set so we we are
crossing each lap with a certain time
where they have got just given us if
it's low we have to increase and if it's
faster we have to maintain it
[Music]
sometimes when you feel you want to call
you have to relax and that shows that
you re in a in a coochie yeah
it's more of a control environment since
when the coach before beginning each and
every session then we go to the coach
the coach explains to us that this is
the best so we try to stick at the pace
of the coach and sodomized us so we
don't get crazy but maybe two at the end
we can cut crazy closets so we are we
are nearing the end of the session
our speed is not so fast in like 1000 is
anomaly ran from 250 mm 2.5 38 to 40
that's a fast real fast that say to
photograph during the last time like mm
we are doing after 5.6 540 1,600 here -
enough - 4412 understeer team up to 315
317 actually we don't run that much
faster okay for Elliot here on his face
but Mia's like 260 I know but I remember
I run 159 in great role in the UK last
year September and I think I was running
like 250 250 that's what we do see any
training always so that time it was
feeling actually nice like I was able to
run constantly - GT - reached 250 while
2 years back if you told me like that
that's fun so truck actually opens you
let you always say that I don't know how
to explain but to open your legs you
could go much faster much easier for the
in the long run and as I say also fart
legging Kagome we have a cool system
whereby you are leading and somebody's
following and when you finish you go
back and follow the others it gives
everybody a chance to show his energy
that and tell him that there you can you
are able to do in there is in if you are
ever the trucking profession in a
cutaway it's teamwork teamwork also call
it open minds of many people
Tim workers alkalete a belief that
somebody can do better there Berkeley
doing you asana in a good way
you know when you start began stalking
after the speed have been done your body
reacts because this is when you are
becoming tired and when you become tired
and then you began another speed speed
walk your body wants to adapt so that
when you become tired in a race there is
that reaction from your body that you
are used to then you can speed up and
can never affect you
[Music]
it's really special to to everyone here
in camp because when we want to trust we
work together as a team and when we
achieve we celebrate that that we did as
a team and it's always it's always about
teamwork which is our key close to
everyone that to be a an active member I
support a supportive member so you have
to do a pact to give everyone a chance
to need to work for himself and to
achieve what he what he or she wants
someone will drop you get motivation
someone will go too fast and the code
will punish him to do it again everyone
will of course so of course then you
make jokes and laugh and this is
actually nice thing but I used to hate
it but now I will enjoy
this group of athletes that we handle
and coach I've worked in a formula of
team ik so naturally when they we go for
training they organize themselves
we don't know ask them in the beginning
when you started the whole thing
organize them but somehow naturally
they've grown into the system and causes
they believe in teamwork I think we all
enjoy
it's about Akali acceptance about love
in the track session
it's about knowing the phonetics it's
about knowing that that is their own
road to success
after transition that is why we had each
other hands after the transition because
of what we have done it to show that
it's science over we have done it
something good
yes of course taxation is are always
tough because of mas Pete but I do
always enjoy so much in speed petitions
because when I achieved the tacit which
was set for the speed it's always my
choice it's always my special moment
that I've achieved what was set for
today and it motivates me to go for the
next day the next session
[Music]

Hey guys my name is Denver Riddle, I’m
a colorist and filmmaker and if you're wondering
how can I make the look of my films stand
out through color grading in Premiere Pro CC
and make my films look big budget?
Well I’m going to reveal that here in this beginner
crash course using the Lumetri color tools
found in Adobe.
We’re going to create this amazing look,
you can download the look as LUT or look up
table and easily apply this to your own footage.
Also, while YouTube is a fantastic resource
for learning about so many different kinds
of subjects if you are looking for a step-by-step
guide that takes you all the way through discovering
the art of color grading and getting the big
Hollywood film looks I want to let you know
about a free training workshop I’m going
to be doing where I reveal my top color grading
secrets, to attend the just click the link
below in the description and I hope to see
you there.
Alright, let’s do this thing!
Here inside let’s set up our workspace for
color grading,
we’ll choose Color workspace and that will
bring up the Lumetri color tools.
In the top section, we have the Scopes…we
have the Program Panel, where we see the clip
we are currently working on, and the Lumetri
Color panel over here on the side, where we can perform our grading.
It’s also worth pointing out the Effects
Control panel where we can do some other things,
including adding and tracking color masks
but more on that in a bit.
Before we jump in and start grading this thing,
let’s discuss basic terminology for how
we define color.
The three basic terms that we use to define
color are Hue, Saturation, and Luma.
Hue is the name we call colors.
Saturation is the intensity or vividness of
a hue.
And Luma is the brightness or shade of hue.
It’s also important to know how to read
the scopes, which can be super beneficial.
If you’re in the color workspace the scopes
should appear but if not just click on the
Lumetri scopes tab.
The three scopes I always use are the waveform,
the RGB parade and the vectorscope.
The waveform let’s us correct for exposure.
If I overlay an image on top of the waveform,
you can see that the trace the stuff you see
here actually corresponds with the image of
the girl dancing.
The RGB parade scope is helpful for correcting
white balance issues, it reads similar to
the waveform other than it’s broken out
into the individual color channels of red,
green and blue.
With this scope, it makes it easier to spot
imbalances if either the image is too cool
or too warm.  How that will show is one channel elevated above the others.
The Vectorscope, corresponds directly with
the color wheel, and I’ve overlaid it here
for convenience.
It shows what colors are in the image as well
as their saturation.
The further the trace extends from the center
of the scope, the more saturated or vivid
the colors are.
Here’s a simple but powerful workflow for
color correction: We first correct the exposure
or brightness of the image, second the white
balance or color temperature if there are
any issues and lastly the saturation by either
increasing or reducing it.
This will make more sense as we actually do
it!
Let’s first make a correction to the exposure
of this image using the basic correction panel.
Now if you look at the controls in the basic
corrections panel you’ll see controls for
highlights and shadows, but also for whites
and blacks.
Lumetri uses a terminology that’s slightly
different than other grading applications.
But here’s how the controls work:
The Blacks control adjusts the darkest parts
or the very bottom darkest point…and the
Whites control adjusts the brightest or the
very top of the image.
The Shadows control affects the tonal range
between the shadows and the midtones if say
you want to recover or darken details in the
shadow areas and the Highlights control effects
the tonal range between the highlights and
the midtones, or the upper part of the image
if say again you want to recover or brighten
details in the highlight areas.
We’ll adjust the shadows first with the
blacks control while watching the waveform.
We want to bring the trace in the shadows
down until the darkest parts of the image
sit right above 0.
Then we’ll bring up the highlights with
the whites control so the brightest parts
of the trace sits right about here near the
top.
Then let’s darken the undertones or the
area between the shadows and the midtones
by pulling the shadows slider to the left…
this will help us remove that washed out look
from the talents face.
And then I’ll just adjust this a little
more until we have good contrast and exposure.
This is the first step.
Next we’ll fix the color temperature since
the image is looking cool.
Looking at the RGB Parade scope, the blue
trace is elevated above the red and green.
Our goal is to “neutralize” or white balance
the whites and we’ll want to find something
in the image that is white.
In this case, we’re going to use her sneakers
as a reference.
Now we can do this manually with the temperature
and tint sliders or we can save some time
and use Premiere’s auto White Balance Selector.
To do that we just need to select and click
on the white part of the image and voilaaa…
the temperature and tint sliders automatically
move to white balance the shot and the traces
are aligned in the RGB Parade Scope.
Now if for whatever reason we’re not happy
with the result we can still manually adjust
those sliders to our liking.
In this case I think we can warm up the image
a little bit.
And that’s the second step.
As our final step let’s boost the color
a little bit by increasing the saturation.
And here’s what the clip looks like before
and after the correction.
Pretty amazing right?
On the next shot we’ll repeat the same procedure
going for a nice balance of exposure with
the the blacks, whites, shadows and highlights
controls…the color temperature in the shot
looks off too, so we’ll use the white balance
eyedropper, this time, over the truck in the
background.
I’ll then refine it a little manually.
Lastly we’ll add some saturation too.
Moving to the third shot, we wanna match it
to the first shot for obvious reasons, since
this is pretty much a wide version of the
same scene.
To give us a good starting point let’s copy
the correction from the first clip to this
one.
We’ll go to the first shot select it and
use the keyboard shortcut command "C" (if you're on a Mac) or control
"C" if you’re on Windows, we’ll then go
back to this clip… right click on it and
choose Paste Attributes from the dropdown
menu.
Make sure the Lumetri Color effect is checked
and click OK.
This copies the correction and gives us a
good starting point, but you’ll see that
we still have some matching issues.
The image is too dark.
To help with matching we can go to the Color
Wheels & Match panel and activate the Comparison
View.
Now we can see a side by side comparison of
our clip and any other clip in the timeline.
There are also vertical and horizontal split
options, but we’ll stick to the side by
side option.
Now here’s the really cool thing.
In the side by side view, we can compare them
visually AND in the scopes as well so this
makes matching a breeze.
To match the traces better we’ll bring up
the general exposure using the exposure slider
and then bring up the shadows with the blacks
control.
We can see now in the Waveform that both traces
look like they’re at the same level.
That’s a nice looking match.
Now let’s disable the Comparison View
option.
In the interest of time I’ve already gone
ahead and performed color correction to these
remaining clips.
But in this last shot you’ll see that the
yellow pole looks greenish compared to the
ones on the other shots.
Well what’s really cool, is that with Lumetri
we can fix that one color.
So let’s open the HSL Secondary panel and
then with the eyedropper, let’s click and
drag through the pole to qualify it.
To see what we’ve selected, let’s turn
on the highlight feature by clicking here.
Now clearly our selection isn’t enough.
So let’s improve our selection with the
hue, saturation and luma sliders.
Then add just a little denoise and blur to
soften the key.
Okay now let’s turn the highlight feature
off.
We’ll then drag the color wheels control
until the pole loses that green tone… and
Bam!  Doneski!
As a final touch, her face is looking a little
dark so to lighten it we’ll accomplish that
with a mask, where we’re effectively relighting
the scene, something really cool we can do
in post.
Now in order to do this using Lumetri we’ll
need to add a 2nd instance.
To do that we need to open the effect panel
and then If we go to the Project Panel we’ll
see a double arrow located at the upper right
side… go ahead and click on that and choose
Effects from the dropdown menu.
Once we find the Lumetri Color Effect we’ll
drag it to the Effect Control panel… and
this adds a second instance of lumetri where
we can now use a shape mask.
I’ll go ahead and add a mask and size and
position it over here face like so… and
add some feathering so this doesn’t stand
out too much.
Then to lighten his face, we’ll increase
the shadows…and highlights…
Playing it back you can that the talent’s
face moves so this is a problem.
To address that we’ll want to track the
shape to her face, so going to the Effects
Control Panel, we can easily do this by clicking
on the track forward button.
And badda, bing, bada bang!
The shape moves perfectly with the movement
of our talent’s face.
Really amazing stuff!
I love doing color grading in Premiere Pro
CC.
Okay now it’s time for the really fun part
and that’s creating an awesome look for
these clips.
The Orange/Teal Look is a really popular look
because it uses principles of color contrast
to make the skin tones advance or pop out
from the background.
And frankly it just looks awesome so you’re
going to love this!
I’m gonna show you a quick way to apply
the SAME look on top of all of these clips
and this will save you time and ensure you
have a consistent look across the board.
To do that we’ll go to the Project panel,
right click and select from the dropdown menu…
choose New Item… then Adjustment Layer.
A prompt will appear and we’ll just click
ok.
We’ll drag the Adjustment Layer to the second
video layer over top of our video clips and
any adjustment or color treatments we apply
here, will be applied to all the clips underneath
the adjustment layer.
Pretty sweet huh?
Alright now let’s create the look.
Make sure the adjustment layer is selected
and we’re going to skip and go straight
past the basic correction panel to the curves
where we’ll have more creative control.
And a quick crash course on the way this works
in case you haven’t already used these in
Photoshop is bottom point adjusts the shadows,
the top point adjusts the highlights and we
can make as many points as we want on the
curve in between to shape the tonal range.
In this case we don’t want to affect the
highlights or the shadows too much so we’ll
create contrast in-between these areas known
as the undertones and midtones.
I’ll make a point here in the midtones and
drag it up.
This improves our exposure but makes the undertones
look a little washed out.
So let’s add another point here and drag
it down to adjust the density of the undertones,
there that looks nice, now we have a much
richer contrast.
For color we need to push teal into the overall
image but without affecting the skin tones.
So let me show you how we’ll do this, we’ll
go to the HSL Secondary panel and use the
eyedropper to select our talent’s skin.
We’ll then refine our selection with the
Hue, Sat and luma sliders.
Then add some denoise and blur for good measure.
Then what we need to do since we currently
have our skin tones selected is to actually
invert our selection (like so) and now we
can use the color wheel to introduce teal
into the image with affecting the skin tones.
Now we are onto something… right?
But we are not there yet.
Something is off.
Because we pushed teal into the entire tonal
range our shadows also look teal, so we’ll
want to clean them up so we can have clean black
shadows.
To do that I’m going to show you a really
awesome trick.
I’ll add another instance of lumetri…
go to the Hue Saturation Curves panel.
Then go to the Luma vs Sat curve.
Now the way this tool works is the shadows
are to the left and the highlights are to
the right, and then anywhere that we place
points on the curve, we are able to adjust
the saturation for that part of the tonal
range by either pulling up to increase the
saturation or pulling down to decrease it.
So this is really cool way for selectively
reducing the saturation in the shadows without
affecting anything else so we’ll place a
point here so nothing above is affected and
then we’ll drag the left point all the way
down to reduce the saturation in the shadows.
Voila our shadows are nice and clean and the
skin tones and everything else kept their
saturation.
If I toggle this instance of lumetri off and
back on again… you can see the difference
it made in pulling the teal out of the shadows
on the walls, her hair and the trash can.
Okay, so don’t forget that cool trick.
Now, just to play with these yellow poles
to have them have a closer tone to her coat
and skin tones, so this is more orange teal
we’ll go to the Hue Saturation Curves panel,
and under the Hue vs Hue curve we’ll use
the eyedropper to isolate the yellow range.
And drag it up to introduce more warmth into the poles.
As a final touch, I want to apply one of the LUTs from Ascend that’s available
for download when you sign up for the free
workshop.
Let’s add another instance of Lumetri and
go to the creative panel.
From there we can browse our LUTs and I’ll
choose the 3strip LUT.
Now at first it’s too strong but that’s
okay because we can dial it back to taste
with the intensity slider.
What an awesome look!
Now if any of this, has seemed overwhelming
to you I want to let you know about a great
alternative that we’ve developed as a plugin.
For content creators who don’t want to specialize
as a colorist but still need a professional
look with on screen grading, lightroom style
controls, false color mode for landing the
correct exposure and real time preview of
LUTs and presets, you can find out more about
Cinema Grade I’ll have a link for it in
the description below.
So that’s just an alternative.
Now I know that I covered a lot of things
here, but my purpose was to help you get started
with seeing a difference in your films today.
If you’re looking for more guided help in
discovering the power of color grading I want
to invite you to our 1-hour color grading
workshop where I reveal the top color grading
secrets used in Hollywood and how best to
do color grading in Premiere Pro CC.
You’ll find a link to register for the workshop
in the description below this video.
In the web class I reveal how I went from
being a wedding videographer down to 0 wedding
bookings during the recession of 2008 to improving
the look of my films and landing client work
with some of the biggest brands like Facebook.
I reveal the same techniques that have had
the biggest impact on my career, so if you’re
serious and want to be guided every step of
the the way you won’t want to miss it.
I also want to point that if you want to learn
more about our Color Grading Academy it’s
the only way you can do that.
People ask if we do formal training, well
this is your opportunity to discover that
and we’ll have a special offer for the it
at the end of the presentation.
So be sure to save your seat, click the subscribe
button and then the bell for more grading
videos!
I hope you enjoyed this beginner crash course
as much I enjoyed creating it for you and
I look forward to seeing you at the training.
Have a great day!

ah
old show that was very much focused on
his branding of the the circular LED
shape that was the cover of his first
album so initially we thought well let's
develop on that Nick wanted to move on
to a bigger scale of things but maintain
that kind of uh idea so originally the
the challenge was how do we maintain the
circle but try to put Sub Focus in a
more prominent position rather than
being hidden behind the installation as
he was because what Sub Focus has been
trying to do is develop the show so that
it's more of a live
performance there are quite a few
challenges when performing music
electronically often it's people
interacting with computers or laptops
that doesn't look very interesting to
the crowd I wanted to make my show
completely electronic performance but
make it much more interesting
[Music]
visually so because again we wanted to
put emphasis on this live performance I
thought well one way of course is to
have him in the center and people seeing
that he's playing with stuff and not
just pressing play but the other way was
to make the whole show and installation
react to his live performances so people
get that connection even
more something that we developed for the
show that I'm pretty sure is unique to
USS is that the Lights of the
installation are reactive to the
instruments that I'm playing in real
time so for example the drums that I
play during the intro also create these
flashes of white light across the
[Music]
circles we're using this reactivity
across several of the different
instruments that I play during the show
as far as I know uh we're the only
people doing this kind of reactivity at
the moment and it effectively means that
I'm controlling the sound and the lights
at the same time with Nick music is very
varied he has a lot of different sort of
elements that he wants to try and do so
we have a lot of scope with the content
to be able to try different things so
there are some tracks that are very
graphical based and other tracks that
are more sort of cinematic and his music
gives us the opportunity to look into
lots of different ways of making all
this stuff happen we have a system where
all of the content
will be in
place but he has control over each one
of these little clusters they're midi
controlled and uh link to his Ableton
project so anywhere that he wants to go
in his Ableton project this computer
will follow him so like this is a module
that controls one of these led
batter and this will tell it where to be
in space and how it functions everything
that's in this show was custom
built so everything that we built had no
rules that we had to follow we had to
make them up as we went along so we've
been refining the process as we go and
uh every every show we find something
new that we can do to improve
it now generally LED screens come in
just typical uh squared panels where
also all the LEDs are put into a grid uh
to do them in circles uh you can't
really find Parise that way one of the
new things that we did that hadn't
really been done before was to put the
LEDs in uh perfect circles within the
panel so that you avoid the steps that
you would get when trying to make
circles out of you know squared arrays
of LEDs the whole lighting installation
wasn't the only thing that we had custom
made for the show we also had a bunch of
stuff on the audio side as well uh for
example the software that I use on the
iPads um but also these motion sensors
which I use to control sounds during the
show by moving my hands around in air
above
them
these are the type of things that I've
wanted to do with live electronic
performance for a long time so it's
amazing to finally make them a
[Music]
reality
[Music]
it's R it bullets out my
window see a shells are on the
ground it maybe fatal when the wind
blows but you and I are safe and
S
[Applause]
it's when it bur it out my
window see it shares around the
ground in maybe fade a little
love but you and I are safe
[Music]
and
[Music]
oh
[Music]
[Music]
so here's a bit of a breakdown about my
live
setup I've got the trackpad here here
the two iPads I use this one on the left
for sample chopping so I can take a a
piece of sound and chop it and rearrange
it into little
bits on this side um I've got a step
sequencer which is basically one bar
split up into lots of sections and I use
this for programming new drum beats
things like that here I've got one of
the motion sensors here I've got the
other
one and uh over here's the keyboard and
here is various controllers to control
more in-depth controls on the step
sequencer uh but yeah and this is is the
main brain of the operation this is the
APC which I use for navigating around
the projects and playing different
sections of my songs so I'll give you a
little demo
here just run a
[Music]
beat then I'm going to add some
[Applause]
snares add a high
hat or choose a different high
[Applause]
hat
[Music]
maybe Loop a section of
[Music]
vocal start bing up the beat a little
[Music]
bit
make a build
up and then start to bring in the rest
of the original
[Applause]
track
feel like feel like
feel that's pretty
cool
[Music]
[Applause]

which report
[Music]
so you may be aware that
BBC has recently broadcast a documentary
a longish documentary on the Gujarat
rights which also says that Narendra
Modi was the perpetrator of ethnic
cleansing
now this is based on a secret document
that apparently question has come from
we are just to explain to you has come
from the foreign office from 2002.
now
can what is the Indian government's
reaction to it the British prime
minister has spoken but what has the
Indian government said or done about it
you were giving some examples from the
BBC documentary I presumed the one you
talk about was day before
do note that this has not been screened
in India so I am only going to comment
on the context of what I have heard
about the or have my colleagues have
seen let me just make it very clear we
think this is a propaganda piece
designed to push a particular
discredited narrative
um the bias a lack of objectivity and
frankly A continuing Colonial mindset is
blatantly visible
if anything
this film or documentary is a reflection
of the agency and individuals that are
peddling uh this narrative again
it makes us wonder whether about the
purpose of this exercise and the gender
behind it and frankly we do not wish to
dignify such efforts
just to follow up I I I'm kind of
confused as to how can a documentary be
labeled as propaganda if it has not been
viewed in India as you say and also a
very specific question I mean the
documentary does show the former foreign
Secretary of UK then Jack straw on
record saying that there is this cable
that exists internal report that exists
does India confirm or deny this report
is India taking this up the report on
the Gujarat Riots of 2019.
this report with UK which report
the report that Mr Jack straw refers to
in the documentary ah okay
that there is an internal cable of the
UK government
I will continue with that from the Hindu
the BBC documentary also says that that
the Gujarat rats actually led to the
killing of UK citizens of Indian origin
so did the UK government ever take this
up with the Indian government till
before
the death of UK citizens in the Gujarat
riots
human take-up is in what if there's a
legal thing legal thing for the sake of
Justice or damage
diplomatically uh you know I'm not sure
you're asking the right question why
would they take up a case diplomatically
for a death
I mean their citizens like you know but
their citizens dying you know questions
a very broad one I'll try to answer I'm
not fully convinced your question
yourself Smith I try to answer both your
questions look um you can't have it both
ways I am confirming that this as far as
I know is not available for viewing here
I delete a question shouldn't have been
asked to me no but people are happy to
ask me a question which is not to be
viewed in India this is because we have
a high commission we have information to
that video okay so that is not clean
screen here I am repeating again
um we think it's a propaganda piece our
assessment this is a propaganda piece
now how can you say that I am saying it
we have seen it and I feel it's a
propaganda piece I don't know what's the
perspective you could say it's not aired
here true but I happily answering
questions here I'm happy to say it's not
aired in India and I could say I think I
have no comment to make but since you
asked I am responding to it
um the separate question you had about
the comments by uh former foreign
secretary in that and something about
reports that he is suffering look he
seems to be referring to some internal
UK reporter how do I have access to that
and it's a 20 year old report uh why
would I just jump on it now and just
because Jack so straw says it how does
it ended Latin that much legitimacy I
heard words like inquiry and
investigation this reason we use the
word colonial mindset
we don't use words Loosely uh what
inquiry they were diplomats here
investigation are they ruling the
country I I'm sorry I do not agree with
that characterization and obviously
there is an agenda behind him UK
Citizen's death look um
if there are deaths here in our country
they followed by our legal procedure
whether they took it up in 2002 look I
don't have any answer I wasn't around
and I'll have to check whether it was
taken up uh whether that's a formality
of taken up or not whether legal systems
but as you very well know there is a
been a lot of legal process against
deaths that have happened uh during that
time I wouldn't be able to answer
whether it was taken up or not without
checking the facts of that

Grace and peace to you all in Jesus's
mighty
name after much prayer and reflection I
want to share with you all a short
statement in relation to the documentary
on BBC
regarding my mentor Prophet TB
Joshua remember first that salvation is
personal as the scripture says in
Revelation
3:20 Philippians 2:12 and John
3:16 as a disciple of prophet tib Joshua
for 17
years from
2004 to his passing in
2021 I want to emphasize that my
personal experience es do not correlate
with any of the allegations in this
documentary I personally witnessed both
the fruits of the Holy Spirits in
Galatians 5:22-23
and the gifts of the Holy Spirits 1
Corinthians 12:
7-1 in the life of of prophet TB Joshua
and I saw the the name of Jesus Christ
consistently glorified and the truth of
God's word consistently
preached now I have a word of advice for
believers as
Christians we must be careful not to
shift our Attention our Focus from the
spiritual to the Natural and get
distracted from the Great
Commission please see Mark 16 from: 15
to 18 Galatians
3:3 and 1 Corinthians 2
verse4 Disciples of Jesus Christ must
remain focused
on doing what God has called us to
do
preaching the Good
News to a troubled
World remember what Hebrews chapter 13
ver8
says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
today and forever his power to heal the
sick has not changed his power power to
deliver the oppressed has not changed
his power to restore broken
hearts has not
changed his power to save the Lost has
not changed and faith in his mighty name
still works wonders
today acts
3:16 Phil Philippians chap
2:
9-
11 let us
continue to fix our eyes on Jesus Christ
the author and the finisher of our faith
as Hebrews 12:1 says and let us continue
to love
everyone and Trust only
God God bless you all and
remember it is all about Jesus

how do i film, edit, color grade the videos that i 
shoot on my iPhone 13 Pro Max?! i'm about to share  
all of it with you like right now
well if you've seen any of my recent short films 
the Yosemite one the Light and Shadows one which  
were all a hundred percent shot on this iPhone 13 
Pro Max you may have wondered to yourself, "dang,  
how did Bryan shoot and edit and color grade all 
of this footage? it looks cinematic it definitely  
doesn't look like it was shot on an iphone" so 
i wanted to make this video to share with you  
guys my secrets my tips my tricks on exactly how 
i created these films and if you are shooting with  
the iPhone 13 i'm hoping this video will help 
you to go create some amazing content right in  
the palm of your hand now if you didn't know i'm 
shooting all of this footage in Cinematic mode  
now i did do a full review on Cinematic mode if 
you want to check that video out click up above  
but cinematic mode on the iPhone 13 simply offers 
you 30 frames per second at 1080p resolution in  
Dolby Vision HDR so you can't actually manipulate 
the settings beyond that i personally think the  
footage still looks really good but one thing i'm 
not a huge fan of is that 30 frames per second  
it just looks a bit more like footage for a soap 
opera or like live tv sports and the news one of  
the first things that i do when i get my footage 
into my video editing software adobe premiere pro  
is actually set my project frame rate to 23.976 
and then i take my 30 frames per second footage  
and slow it down by 80 percent and this 
gives me a much smoother feeling footage  
if you take a look at some of these shots here 
comparing the 30 frames per second footage  
to that same footage slowed down by 80 percent 
you can definitely see a huge difference  
now also when you're shooting in Cinematic 
mode you have two camera focal length options  
the 1x camera and the 3x i pretty much shoot 
all of my footage with the 1x camera which is  
a 26 millimeter focal length and i found that 
the artificial depth of field that Cinematic  
mode creates is just better with the 1x camera 
i do shoot some stuff at the 3x camera but i'm  
typically not trying to create any depth of field 
with it additionally i keep my aperture at f 2.8  
i like a more shallow depth of field again this 
all helps to create a much more cinematic look i  
could bump the aperture to like f8 or i think it 
even goes all the way up to f16 but i just prefer  
a more shallow depth of field it just gives you 
more of that like it was shot on a cinema lens  
one thing i do when i open up the camera go to 
Cinematic mode and shoot is adjust the exposure  
i've personally found that the iPhone exposure 
right at zero just feels a little too bright  
not that it's overexposed but it just feels 
a bit too bright for me so i usually take it  
down to like negative one and it also saves me 
a little bit of time in post-processing because  
that much closer to the final product in terms of 
coloring and exposure and all of that for my light  
and shadows video i actually used my Ronin-S 
gimbal and kind of rigged it to a piece to an  
iPhone tripod it was kind of a sketchy situation 
so i wouldn't recommend that you don't need  
that nice of a gimbal for your iPhone what 
i actually bought recently is the DJI OM 5  
and it's much more adequate for the job at a 
much better price point it's only 160 bucks it  
keeps a fantastic battery charge on it you 
can get really smooth shots with it you can  
run with it it just does the job probably 
about 80 percent of my shots maybe even 90  
of my shots are with the gimbal and then i do some 
handheld stuff if i'm getting tight detail shots i  
usually don't want to be like trying to get into 
tighter spaces with the gimbal and if i don't  
need to be like running around with it you know 
it's easy to just take it out of your pocket and  
shoot with it like that without having to get the 
gimbal set up i would definitely recommend this  
for sure it's linked in the description click on 
that link spend 160 bucks and get smoother footage  
i personally use Adobe Premiere Pro to color 
grade all of my footage and what i typically  
do is actually create two iterations of Lumetri 
color the first iteration of Lumetri color is  
usually going to be adjusting basic settings 
things like white balance exposure highlights  
and shadows some basic tone curve adjustments now 
keep in mind just the unedited Cinematic mode of  
footage already looks good so i find that i don't 
have to do a ton of crazy just basic adjustments  
so that's all within that first iteration of 
Lumetri color then i add an additional Lumetri  
color and start to really dial in specifically 
on the red green and blue tone curves this is  
where i might add even more vibrance saturation 
a lot more color and creative adjustments on that  
second Lumetri color you might be asking well 
bran why do you do the two layers of Lumetri  
color why not just do one and i found that with 
two layers of Lumetri color i can make a lot more  
subtle yet still dynamic adjustments to the 
footage i'm color grading with just one Lumetri  
color i found that i'm pushing the sliders and the 
control points a lot more to achieve the results  
that i want it just ends up looking over edited 
i wish i could give you an exact science to this  
but so much of what i'm doing is referencing other 
filmic looks films that i'm personally a fan of  
just replicating that cinematic color now with all 
of that in mind i'm super stoked to share with you  
guys two preset packs that are for adobe premiere 
one is based on the Yosemite short film and one  
is based on the Light and Shadows film if you go 
to the link in the description you can actually  
buy those preset packs and with like one click get 
the colors that i've been able to achieve i spent  
a lot of time dialing in these colors and really 
getting them to look very filmic very cinematic  
they're specifically tailored for that cinematic 
mode footage you can try it on other iPhone  
footage as well check the link in the description 
and get those creamy yummy delicious cinematic  
colors the only other thing i do that makes my 
footage feel very cinematic is add those black  
bars to the top and the bottom of the footage 
and that just gives you that more anamorphic  
widescreen classic film look to it and i simply do 
this by adding an adjustment layer and from there  
i add a crop effects to the adjustment layer do a 
15 crop on the top and the bottom of the footage  
and there you go typically when i just have a 
bunch of unedited iPhone shots i'm gonna start  
cutting up and finding some of my most epic 
and eye-catching shots first and then i'll  
jump over to logic pro and start working on the 
music and usually i'll get a rough idea down for  
the soundtrack and i'll get that idea over into 
premiere and start cutting a lot more of the film  
and it's a bit of a back and forth between the 
music and the cutting until i find a really good  
spot with the music and then finish the cutting in 
premiere and then finalize the music in logic this  
is probably one of the most time consuming parts 
is getting all of that to sync up and making sure  
the story both visually and sonically makes sense 
and meshes well together if you guys didn't know  
which i would imagine you do at this point but i 
did start a music licensing company called Moods  
Sound Design i've personally been producing 
music for over a decade now and i thought  
with my video experience as well as my music 
production experience might as well join those  
forces and create a company that offers just good 
music to videographers and filmmakers so if you  
need good music for your videos which if you're 
already making epic cinematic mode footage with  
your iPhone you probably do need good music go to 
MoodsSoundDesign.com and start a free trial with  
us and you're probably going to find some pretty 
sick music for your next video project so i hope  
you're inspired and stoked by this video to go 
out and create something epic with your iPhone  
technology is getting pretty crazy with these 
things and i'm super excited to see where it goes  
within the next few years go get those preset 
packs sign up for Moods Sound Design it's all  
linked in the description and if you hit that like 
button as well as the subscribe button that would  
just warm my heart thank you guys so much for 
watching i'll see you on the next video peace!

My name is Casey Jones, I've been doing parkour and freerunning for about five years
and I've been doing martial arts tricking for about two and a half years.
So, parkour and freerunning for those who don't know is pretty much going into an environment
and expressing or challenging yourself using obstacles around you.
It's really physically tasking and it's also mentally tasking
because you have to be able to see what you can do with your environment,
like "what can I do with this wall?" or "what can I do with this rail?"
So it's a very different kind of self-expression.
A lot of the time I get the question of why I would do this; what possesses me to want to jump from a fifteen-foot drop?
Everything in society nowadays is so pushy and edgy and people are always judging you.
Whenever you do parkour or do a trick, it's just so distant from that
because everyone in the community is so supportive and they wanna teach you -
it's all about love and I don't mean to sound cheesy but it's just so emotionally connected to who we are
that we love doing it every single second because it's the sort of passion and brotherhood that you get from it.
It's honestly an entire lifestyle change and you never go back from it.
We were at this tree spot at Ward Park which is a pretty popular spot here in Orlando
and this little kid walks up to us and he was like "whoa, you guys are doing flips, that's so cool!",
and this kid was like this tall and I'm sitting down so he's like, maybe seven and he just does a front flip and lands it perfectly.
Then he was like "man, I really wanna learn back flips" so we're like "alright, we could spot you on it".
This kid, before we could even spot him for it, just does it and perfect back tucks
and we're just so like "what!".
It was the greatest moment to see someone so young sharing in what we do
because I started when I'd just turned eleven and this kid started when he was seven.
When I was younger I had a pretty troubled childhood. My parents weren't really ever home;
they were always working so I didn't really get to see them a lot.
And that affected me pretty deeply and I got bullied throughout elementary school, you know,
and partial way through middle school until I started doing parkour.
It really got to me, but it all made me who I am and so that's important and all of this was learned over a very long path,
and I think the moment I realised that was the night that I got put into a behavioral center for about a week.
I was in there the second day when my mom came and visited me and the night that I went into the behavioral center,
my sixteen year old cousin Austin, shot himself over a girl, and it hit me so hard.
Everyone in my family was thinking that could've been Casey - that could've been me who pulled the trigger.
You have to enjoy life and be positive, and for me that's what parkour is all about.
I had a small birthday gathering because my parents pretty much said that "you're not having a sixteenth birthday",
just because they don't have time or whatever; I didn't really question it.
So I was like "alright, I'm gonna call up some friends", and I scheduled this birthday gathering for tricking.
David actually flew here from Miami just to be at this gathering.
We had a great day, and it was just tricks, all day. It was really great just being with my friends. 
I couldn't ask for anything else, I love all you guys very much.
Find your outlet. Parkour and tricking is just the most beneficial thing to me for it
because if I need family I have my tricking and parkour family. I can go to any of those guys;
I could go to Miami if I wanted to and stay the night at their houses for maybe 2 or 3 days.
I know that no matter where I'm at I always have a community around me - I have a family and that's so supportive for me.
It's just this big loving brotherhood between us all, and sisterhood now because there's more girls getting into the sports.
It's just such a moving thing to see so many people all across the world so connected by this one thing
and for all of you out there that have problems or even if you don't have problems, if you just need an outlet,
go try something new: try skateboarding, try BMXing, try wakeboarding, try all these things.
If you don't have the money for it, find a way. Go mow lawns, go hustle on the street, don't sell drugs - drugs are bad -
but just find a way because there's always a way to make success happen.
If you wanna go and skateboard, find yourself a board, or if you wanna try parkour just slip on a pair of shoes.
I don't care what shoes; you can wear Vans. Just put them on and go out there and try it.
For tricking you don't need anything - you don't even need clothes - you just go out to your grass and you try.
Go find a way to do this because in life if you don't try to find a way, you never will. You have to seek it.
Twenty-two stories.
I was out there.

the report The Breakfast Club well
surviving r.kelly that docu-series on
lifetime broke ratings records for a
lifetime in many different ways now it
got 1.9 million total viewers on January
3rd which by the way was my birthday
shout-out to everybody that wish me a
happy birthday
and that was lifetimes best performance
in more than two years in all key demos
they said there was over seven hundred
and forty three thousand total
interactions on social media which was
their largest social premiere for any
series or movie in network history now
there were a lot of people that were
interviewed on this docu-series it took
place over six different episodes I
watched all six episodes so let's get
into a little bit of what happened on
there now there are a lot of people that
saw what our Kelly was doing but didn't
do anything to step in Craig Williams
who worked with our Kelly also discusses
how our Kelly would meet these very
young girls I was traveling through High
Park at one time and I stopped at a
store and Rob was driving by and he was
on his way to Kenwood high school and I
heard a lot about Rob going to Kenwood
high school to to hang out and I always
wondered what the heck is he doing
hanging around the high school
left high school many years ago that's
all I could say on that one cuz I don't
know but I heard that you know he was
picking up a lot of a lot of kids from
the school that's so disgusting and
what's even more disgusting as everybody
else in that documentary that's seen
what was happening that knew what was
happening and did absolutely positively
nothing all you up mother effers are
disgusting now they also in this
documentary talks about how he would
target these young women he would go to
the mall he would go to the schools and
he would whoever made eye contact with
him I gave him a little smile those are
the people he would target even a
security would go over and give the girl
his number he would stay in contact and
a lot of people I saw on social media
we're blaming other people for our
Kelly's behavior but the thing is that
he was an adult he knew what he was
doing was wrong he was trying to cover
things up he was forging documents all
kinds of things were going on with him
and the people around him were yes
enabling him but you cannot blame these
young girls who were the victims and
even if they weren't young girls if you
watch the docu-series you can see they
had all kinds of specialists and
psychologists psychologists on there
discussing what our Kelly was doing
mentally to these young women very
abusive mentally and he was physically
abusive as well according to the women
who were interviewed in this docucenter
is one in particular seen that had a lot
of people talking on social media that
was heartbreaking was watching a mom who
was trying to save her daughter
Dominique from our Kelly's hotel my plan
is just to go into the hotel I know
she's here
god I leave me here and
take it away that came to a close
believe it
such an effing predator and I mean he
played he played on weakness he played
on the fact that these girls wanted to
be stars and you know what he was doing
he was our Kelly for a lot of these
young girls and there's all kinds of
studies that show how your brain
develops and how you make decisions as a
young girl he used with these young
girls he used his position he used his
fame to draw them and lure them in and
then he would slowly little by little do
certain things like all right call me
daddy in the bedroom then it was call me
daddy outside of the bedroom then it was
okay you have to ask permission to use
the bathroom
Nishan II and he would cut them off so
they couldn't even speak to each other
and nobody really understood what was
going on a lot of these girls he was
grooming from a very young age not not
to blame the victims of blame to parents
but what a parent's like that that's
that's the one thing I was kind of
confused like I have three kids three
girls I should say and there's no way I
could even halfway allow my 15 16 17
year old to go without talking to me for
months at a time I I just I just
couldn't Dominique's mom didn't even
know that her daughter was going over
our Kaylee's how she was going with her
friend and so she's thinking she's
hanging out with her girlfriend and in
reality she found out later on that her
daughter was at our Kelly's house that's
crazy
y'all call me crazy for watching my
daughter and putting monitors on my
daughter's phone and on her call like
y'all call me crazy but that no that's
the reason why I because there's
predators there's crazy people that will
take advantage of your kids and your
kids being just just child and just
children just have no clue and it is so
freaky we'll be talking about this all
throughout the morning but our Kelly is
saying that he did not watch the
lifetime show at all just like you said
he didn't watch the sex tape when he was
in court now he's saying that he's going
to sue everybody that actually is
involved and did interviews and all of
those things on the documentary so we'll
see what happens with that but that's
what his claim is that he's gonna sue
everyone and in the next hour and of
course you want you guys to weigh in on
what you thought about this as well now
in other news Letoya Luckett and Thomas
Walker congratulations to them they just
had their daughter so congratulations

first child and Walker second and Kim
Kardashian and Kanye West according to
People magazine are expecting their

North who's five and a half so once
again another baby congratulations to
them but we'll talk more about Kanye
West later on

report

with all the tech and cool video gear
out these days it's easy to get bogged
down in the amount of stuff there is to
buy as a filmmaker when you're just
starting out you might think you have to
get the latest drone plus a professional
gimbal and a giant matte box with every
missed and anamorphic filter there is
before you can shoot anything luckily
this is mostly just marketing and while
these tools might help you build up your
production value down the line when
you're looking at making your first few
projects you can get away with a pretty
simple setup in this video i'm going to
get into the five truly essential things
that you need to get started with your
documentary project and some
recommendations on what i might pick if
i was starting out again
[Music]
hey guys welcome back and if you're new
here my name is luke forsyth documentary
cinematographer and filmmaker and on
this channel i teach the skills i've
learned over 10 years working as a
documentary filmmaker and photographer
okay so you've decided you want to make
a documentary or a short film and after
a few dozen youtube videos you're
feeling overwhelmed with all the stuff
you're supposed to have when i was first
transitioning from professional
photography into documentary production
i felt exactly the same way it seemed
like unless i spent an obscene amount of
money i wouldn't be able to shoot
anything but the reality is that is not
true sure filmmaking is always going to
be an expensive thing to get into
compared to i don't know soccer or
drawing but you can get by in the
beginning with much less than the
internet might lead you to believe in
fact for the first piece of video i ever
shot i only had three of these five
items and it was still published in al
jazeera which is a pretty big outlet so
what are the five essentials and what
would i pick if it were me the first one
is pretty obvious you need a camera i'm
gonna be annoying here and cheat this a
little by saying you need a camera and
whatever zoom lens comes with it which i
know is technically two items but since
they're usually sold as a package deal
i'm going to take some liberties on this
one i'm also going to count a battery or
two and a memory card as included in
this because without them you can't make
the camera work feel free to vent at me
in the comments below for documentaries
especially when you're starting out i
personally think that zooms are more
versatile than primes and even though
some projects might get away with only
using primes and look amazing i'd say
this is the exception rather than the
rule especially if you only have one
camera and you're filming moments that
can't be repeated again having the
ability to go from wide to detail shots
without changing lenses is huge with one
mid-range zoom lens something like a
24-105 or even an 18-55 you can cover
pretty much any normal scene from inside
a cramped car to a wide open landscape
as you advance in your career you might
decide to lean more towards primes for
stylistic reasons and i definitely
respect that but if i was shooting my
first few assignments and didn't have
that kind of confidence i would
absolutely want to zoom the good news is
that camera technology has come so far
that it's really hard to find a bad one
these days what you choose depends on
your budget obviously and what works for
me might not be realistic for you i
personally shoot on sony cameras with an
fx9 and an fx3 and i love that
combination but those are pretty
expensive cameras and it took me 10
years to work up to them if you can
afford it then something like an fx3 or
an a7s3 or even an fx6 if you can swing
it would be on the higher end of things
but you totally don't need to buy five
thousand dollar cameras and please don't
think that these are the only things
that will work when i started out i was
on a crazy tight budget and my policy
with cameras was always to buy whatever
the old model was used so now that the
xt4 is out something like a fuji xt3 or
now that the sony a74 is out look for a
used a7 iii if those are too expensive
take a look at older dslrs on facebook
marketplace and find one that works for
your budget just make sure it has a
microphone jack and shoots at least hd
video there are probably hundreds of
options that will work and unless
someone is paying you to deliver top
quality then don't worry so much if you
don't have the newest and best stuff and
if someone is paying you for that then
you should have a better budget anyways
the moral of the story is just get
something that doesn't break the bank
and start using it because not shooting
anything just because you don't have a
red camera is not the way to get better
i'd also add that you'd want to get a
variable nd as well but since you
technically can get away in most
situations just by riding the aperture
and lowering the iso i'm not going to
say you need it but it's highly
recommended alright so you've got a
camera with a mid-range zoom and that's
covering you for all the moving action
scenes where you're following your
characters around getting a variety of
shots as the story happens in front of
you but what about those moments when
things are a little slower and you can
slow down and really focus on things
like shallow depth of field and
composition without worrying about
missing something that's when you can
start thinking about the second item on
the list a prime lens i know i just went
on and on about zoom lenses and i stand
by my opinion that a zoom lens should be
your first priority in my experience
i'll have zoom lens on my camera most of
the time during a dock shoot but when
the moment allows for it it's great to
have a prime on hand too this is for
things like sit down interviews or when
you find yourself in super low light
environments where the higher aperture
of your zoom just isn't enough a single
prime lens in your bag can bail you out
of all kinds of situations and open up
some really cool creative options when
you have the time and you're not under
as much pressure to capture things in
the moment the debate about which focal
length is best will probably never end
if it were me i'd get a 24 or 35
probably some people also like 50 mil
but it's a little too tight for me to be
useful in all situations 35 would
probably be my first choice because it's
wide enough to film a decent wide but
also tight enough to use on an interview
without distortion but you can also make
a really strong case for 24 millimeter i
know people like mark bone keep one of
those on their camera pretty much all
the time so you'll have to decide for
yourself what works for you in terms of
your style when it comes to which one to
get if you can afford a sigma art lens
i'd probably go with one of those
they're built really well they're
cheaper than the canon and sony lenses
and the image quality is amazing i have
a few of them at different focal lengths
and i think they're the best value for
money out there if those are too much
you could look at something like slr
magic lenses which i've also heard good
things about if you look around on dslr
video shooters youtube page i'm sure
you're going to find a ton of
recommendations for great budget lenses
whatever you end up picking a single
prime lens in combination with the zoom
will round out your camera package
really nicely okay so that takes care of
the camera side of things but in
documentary video is only half the
equation some people are adamant that
sound is more important than video and i
might even agree with them as much as it
hurts me to admit as a dp sound is gonna
create the backbone of your story and
without good sound you're gonna have a
tough time in the edit if you have good
audio you can build out a scene in post
and cut around any mistakes in your
shots but if the audio sucks it's gonna
be really hard to keep the story rolling
a good example might be the popular
netflix crime series the jinx spoiler
alert here i'm gonna ruin the ending in
this next tip so mute the video if you
plan to watch it okay so by the final
episode we've spent five hours or
something wondering if this guy is the
murderer and right up until the last few
minutes we still don't know then he goes
into the bathroom and forgets he's
wearing a lav mic and admits the whole
thing thinking no one can hear him it's
a crazy ending and it makes the whole
show notice that the shot they have on
the screen is about as boring an image
as you could imagine yet because the
audio is there it tells the story and in
docs story is always king so to make
sure your audio base is covered you're
gonna need two things and don't worry
i'm not lumping them into one this time
the first is a decent shotgun i have a
few of them and i switch them out
depending on the camera and the weight
i'm going for if you have a big shoulder
camera like an fx9 then maybe go for
something like a sennheiser 416 at the
high end or maybe down to an mk 600 or
whatever the road equivalent is to save
on weight those mics are going to work
really well on a bigger rig but if
you're using something smaller like a
mirrorless system that doesn't have xlr
ports i'd probably downsize to something
like the rode videomic pro there are
definitely cheaper options out there but
again just get the best one you can
afford a shotgun is essential for all of
your ambient sound and in some
situations it'd probably work to cover a
character as well and without one you're
kind of screwed for basic audio but what
happens when you're following a
character through different environments
and they're not always facing you a
shotgun doesn't capture sound well
unless it's right in front of the
subject and since people don't always
live their lives thinking about the
direction of your microphone you're
gonna need a lav mic to make sure you're
getting clean audio the whole time a
scene like we just talked about from the
jinx for example would never be possible
without a shotgun alone and a lava work
even if your character is in the next
room as long as you keep the camera
rolling pro tip here i'll often put the
camera down in my lap but keep rolling
as characters talk just in case they say
something interesting then you can take
that sound bite and layer it over with
b-roll in the edit the classic basic lav
mics are sennheiser eng series which i
think is now up to the g4 i bought a set
of g3s in 2012 and have been using the
same ones ever since you might have to
change out the microphone cable itself
over the years as they can break but the
actual transmitter and receiver set
should last you a really long time
there's also cheaper options like the
road to go or whatever it's called and
i'm going to leave it to you to choose
one that works for your budget but i
just say that good audio gear never
really goes out of date so it's worth
investing in something decent because
you're going to get to keep it much
longer than your camera cheap stuff will
break faster and you're going to spend
more in the long run replacing it
whatever you go for though you'll
definitely want a wireless one because
being tethered to your characters just
won't work for a moving dock so if you
have your picture and sound sorted now
it's time to talk about the fifth and
final essential the tripod no one is
really excited about tripods except
maybe landscape photographers but a good
tripod can last your entire career i
shoot my stuff handheld probably ninety
percent of the time but for those
moments when you need a steady shot like
a sit-down interview or some
establishing landscapes there is no way
around it you're gonna need sticks i
personally use the sackler flotec 100
which is one of my favorite pieces of
gear ever i actually made an entire
video about it and how it stopped a
bullet in mexico which i'll link to
somewhere up here but that thing is
really expensive and probably not what
most people are looking for when they're
starting out i know benro makes some
budget tripods and their quality is
getting better all the time and when i
started i used one of theirs so that's
also a possible option peak design
tripods are also pretty cool if you have
a smaller camera when it comes to
choosing one for documentaries
especially if you're on a budget i would
worry less about things like carbon
fiber and extreme light weight and
instead prioritize getting one with a
ball head so you can level it without
adjusting the legs there is nothing more
annoying or hard on the back than
fiddling with little knobs trying to
drop them down to get it level and a
ball head is going to make this so much
easier if your tripod isn't level it's
super obvious to everyone watching so
the faster you can do this the happier
you'll be a single stage release is also
nice to have which basically just means
that you only have to open one latch to
drop all the lag segments rather than a
separate knob or lock for each part of
the leg but it's not a must-have by any
means a tripod is another thing like
audio where the technology doesn't
change very much so if you invest in a
decent one you're going to keep it
across multiple camera systems and
that's it with those five things a
camera and a zoom a prime lens a shotgun
a lav mic and a tripod you can cover 99
of documentary situations you can
endlessly add to this kit to the point
where you travel with seven checked bags
like i do but those are really the only
things you need to get going i'd say as
soon as you can add a good light
something like an aperture 120d maybe so
you can up the quality of your sit-down
interviews but when i was first starting
out i didn't have a light and i got by
just fine by putting my subjects near a
big window so it's definitely not
essential when i shot my first ever
video piece which was a two minute long
spot for al jazeera about cambodia's
first female mma fighter i didn't own a
tripod a light or even a prime lens so
whatever you do don't let your lack of
gear stop you from getting started so
there it is i hope this video was
helpful and thinking about how to start
building out a documentary filmmaking
kit let me know in the comments if you
think i missed anything or what you
think the essential items are and if you
liked that video you might like this one
where i go into even more detail about
my views on the great zoom vs prime lens
debate in the context of documentary
filmmaking see ya

ancient tradition
untouched nature
and Urban Development Laos is a country
where these three Worlds Collide in a
very distinct Laotian way
the country is building dams these
enormous works of engineering are what
the Buddhist country is hoping will
allow it to catch up with its wealthier
neighbors
but during a debt crisis can the country
break out of isolation
thank you
the Mekong River is where fishermen
sirhood grew up he knows it inside out
the 25 year old has deployed a bottom
set Gill net
he lives in a small village in Laos
further Upstream a huge hydropower plant
is being built on the Mekong
fishermen are concerned about fish
migration routes spawning grounds and
fishing waters on Asia's most important
Waterway
could you add if the dam is built I
might not be allowed to fish here
anymore this whole section of the river
could be declared a nature reserve
because we are right behind the future
power plant here but my family is
fishing rights only for this section the
fishing times could also change
the Marxist leninist government of Laos
wants to see the country become the
battery of Southeast Asia building
around 100 dams by 2013.
so far 78 have been built one of them is
located on the Namo a tributary of the
Mekong River
the Namo one power plant one of seven on
this River alone was built by China
three years ago at a cost of 2.7 billion
euros
in return the Chinese state-owned
company power China will sell
electricity to the country for the next
29 years after which the power plant
will be taken over by Laos
The Village lutta Hair located directly
behind the dam had to give way for the
plant the only trace the Old Village
Temple by now mostly submerged in the
reservoir
Buddhist monk buncha sotomano is now
worshiping at a newly built Temple
further up the mountain
s
the old Temple was a gift from our
ancestors but the government really had
no choice
I had to do something to make the
population better
the dam brings important foreign
exchange to the country
and
with a donation of about 14 euros per
mural the villagers can bring color to
the new building piece by piece
the painter has been working tirelessly
and the monk seems pleased with the
result
he is content with the change but not
everyone in the village below shares his
stoicism
the state gave every resident the same
compensation when they were resettled
with each household receiving 600 euros
and a 400 square meter plot of land
the farmer sutep sun-dried chilies once
dried on a larger porch
[Music]
house was twice the size of this one
with two floors
the new place is just so small I started
to extend it myself piece by piece but
there's hardly enough space for that
[Music]
with the identical partition plots The
Village has lost its Soul the residents
say and the soil up in the mountain is
no match for the fertile ground by the
river where animals thrived and crops
flourished
the Mekong River is the vital artery of
Laos spanning along its western border
the Communist ruled country as one of
the poorest in Asia seven million people
live here most of whom work in
agriculture
Downstream the quality of the soil is
degrading thanks to the hydropower
plants further up
by slowing the flow of the river itself
the dams limit the supply of valuable
nutrients too
more fertilizer has to be used in the
fields to compensate but fertilizer
prices as soaring says Farm upon
the collapse of the Laos currency the
Kemp can be felt Nationwide
I'm still buying the same things at the
store what can I save on we're doing on
powdered milk for my baby perhaps
I've had to start using up my savings
and borrow money from relatives
Laos 2 is borrowing money from China the
number one investor in the land of the
temples
high amounts of foreign debt are largely
to blame for the currency's decline
the situation only exacerbated by the
covid pandemic
like many places in the capital the vien
Chan shopping mall has seen a huge
decline in Commerce
Miss news Boutique on the second floor
is only just starting to draw customers
again
the rent has doubled rent she pays in
dollars
I heard the government gets inflation
under control soon before the currency
collapsed I could buy 10 pairs of pants
for about 50 euros
now I get five and utilities have gone
up too
at one store however customers are
lining up
train tickets have been sold on the
first floor since late 2021.
China has built a 414 kilometer railroad
line from the Chinese border to laos's
Capital vien Chan
during the day high-speed trains hurtle
through the country
at Night freight trains bring Goods over
the Border
[Music]
the trains speed through dozens of
tunnels and valleys
in the next few years the line will be
extended to Bangkok in Thailand and to
Vietnam's deep sea port
Laos is the only landlocked country in
Southeast Asia so the new rail line
could improve things for many
especially farmers will benefit
according to Alex crema of the World
Bank
well Laos often uses the phrase
moving from Land locked to land linked
and we've looked at the numbers and we
think that that actually is a very
realistic vision for the country we're
already seeing
Farmers particularly in the north of the
country take advantage of the proximity
to very fast growing markets for
agricultural products and in fact this
has really lifted the poverty rate in
the north of the country
we are now arriving at long tap on
Station instead of a treacherous
day-long journey by bus on muddy tracks
the trip from the capital to the world
heritage site luang probang now only
takes a few hours
at the destination a modern train
station the likes of which are usually
seen in China
the new Railway has opened the door for
tourism which brings new opportunities
for the city if you take a walk here in
the morning you might think that time
has stood still
Buddhist monks perform their daily
morning arms round
20 years ago a quarter of laotians lived
below their poverty line today that
number has fallen to just seven percent
but if that number is to continue
improving now is the time for action
the Communist Party of Laos must find a
better way to finance itself than
through additional debt according to the
World Bank
new dams cost money that Laos does not
have and money from hydropower must be
invested properly for example in better
roads and bridges
for a long time there was only a single
bridge over the Mekong to Thailand today
there are four and the fifth will open
in 2024.
at the market in Vientiane the hope is
that prices will sink most of the
products here are imported so faster
delivery would be an advantage
war in Ukraine crane has seen energy
costs explode even here
the rice comes from Laos but has a long
transport route
man so I have to charge twice as much
okay I'll put that one here
onions like these aren't grown here
these ones from Vietnam are bigger and
have gotten much more expensive
those pumpkins come from the south so
they cost around 30 percent more
night falls in the capital and the
streets come to life
Laos is a Young Nation but also a
patient one young people here don't want
to hear about protests despite the high
prices and corruption in the country
there is hope that the end of the
pandemic will bring about change the
hope that for many takes the form of a
hydroelectric power plant
for many laotians green hydropower and
tourism are the light at the end of the
tunnel and the potential is huge
electricity from hydropower alone could
bring the country foreign exchange
earnings of up to 2.6 billion euros
annually
but opposition to too many dams is
growing in neighboring countries studies
warn of the impact on fishing for
example
oh
and more fit fisherman to heard calls it
a day for the time being he is glad that
he can fish at all
a few months ago the gasoline was so
expensive that I couldn't go out at all
that was a real blow our whole village
depends on fishing
[Music]
the catch this afternoon was modest
it's hard to say for sure what will come
of the Mekong it's incredibly diverse
Wildlife or its fisherman when the dams
are completed but for now the river
flows the source of life and livelihood
for some 60 million people

432 days have passed since kflox
surrendered himself to detectives for a
murder that happened on December 16 2021
while walking with his sister and her
friend down 151st and Amsterdam he
crossed paths with another gang member
who spotted him from inside of a barber
shop words were exchanged and just
moments later the man who was identified
as Oscar Hernandez died from bullets to
the neck and chest after 9-1-1 calls
came pouring in investigators quickly
identified K flock in his 4 000 outfit
as the main suspect they then issued a
warrant for his arrest on first-degree
murder charges on December 23rd and
without question he self-admitted he was
only 18 years old at the time
three days later his lawyer would
release a statement claiming the
shooting was done in self-defense
somebody walked out to confront him it's
all on video when the guy hits the
ground he's got a loaded gun that was in
his pocket that his hand was on at the
time we considered that to be
self-defense the surveillance footage
that was released seemed to strongly
back this up seeing that he was the one
who was approached and then threatened
now those court date would continuously
be delayed the entire 2022 year it was
likely he was going to beat the case and
be released within a matter of time but
the feds had other plans and they want
anything but to see k-flog back on the
streets of the Bronx on February 23 2023
the federal government stormed in and
added a 15-page indictment on k-flog and
seven others now being labeled the
leader of an organized crime syndicate
the New York federal court is demanding
that the 19 year old rapper serve a
minimum of life in prison or a maximum
of the death penalty
in Harlem the incident took place
yesterday morning
[Music]
before he was ever known as cavelock he
was just Kevin Perez born April 20th
2003 in the Bronx New York although the
Bronx is the birthplace of hip-hop music
40 of the borough lives below the
poverty line making it a hub for crime
and gang activity unfortunately he was
no exception to that growing up in this
environment his mom says he tried to
play Sports boxing and was also into
fashion but she never expected him to
become a rapper he wanted to actually do
clothing designs and stuff like that I
had him in boxing because that's what we
do things like that but never nothing of
music ever school never interested him
either he already had an early mindset
of getting out on the streets and he did
so with the hustle of someone twice his
age at just 10 years old he had already
been outside hanging on the Block K
flock took note of what other rappers
were doing at the time in Chicago
because while he was growing up in the
Bronx the Chicago drill scene was
starting to take over although young in
his mind he was old enough to start
hustling and meeting new people in the
neighborhood even though K flock was
good at making enemy he was even better
at making friends
Aaron Howard or Dougie B is actually his
blood cousin but the two grew up like
good friends then there was question or
B love as we know him he was the oldest
and had a lot of influence over them
including being the first one to pick up
rapping and lastly there was also Jalen
known as pmvj who at one point was their
friend needless to say Be Love had
already been in the streets and he had
some connections and was already making
a name for himself to them the streets
were too much fun this was our mindset
at a young age being young and not fully
understanding the lifestyle that came
with it losing family and friends was
part of growing up in the Bronx being
from 187th Street KFOG repped a gang
called sevside in DOA and like any said
they were at war with a few others
sometimes they even referred to
themselves as ebk or everybody Killers
how do you be K because anybody could
get shot so you can imagine they had a
lot of enemies with the YG's and ogs
being the main Ops of Seth side as I
mentioned B love was the first one to
start recording music but he didn't like
the way his songs were coming out so he
ended up giving it up for a while and
never release the songs meanwhile pmbj
would actually be the first one to find
some success with songs like ombk seeing
that pnvj could get views like that only
made them realize they could do it as
well seeing they all come from the same
area shortly after beloved ended up
doing some time Behind Bars later
claiming that someone had snitched on
him this made him hate the street
politics wanting to pursue music more so
he could leave that behind but while
this was happening k flock was running
his Ops down in the streets and would
even go live on Instagram showing him in
hoods he wasn't supposed to be in like
he was Bulletproof
[Music]
down there
although negative this attention would
actually put his name out there so his
reputation was quickly building in just
a few months Flocka had made a few
hundred fans I would watch his streams
where he taunted his enemies the idea of
making music still wasn't on his mind
though the streets had his full
attention
however the atmosphere of New York's
music scene was quickly changing before
this auto-tune melodic rappers like a
boogie and Lil TJ have been setting the
tone but 2018 saw the rise of Brooklyn
drill rappers who began using UK drill
beats giving a whole new sound that
quickly took over the city no drill
wrappers were popping up all over
Brooklyn while the Bronx was struggling
to get anywhere close to that kind of
recognition but that was about to change
foreign
[Music]
Ty beloved came home from his sentence
and upon his return Dougie B convinced
him and K flock to start rapping
seriously but things were only getting
more complicated in the streets at this
point their friend pmvj started repping
a new set in Dougie B and others were
upset about that what is your reason
why you don't like me
one day pmvj was back in Southside
visiting his family when Dougie B and
her friend pulled up allegedly asking
pnvj's mom if he was home she unknowing
of the beef told him that he was
upstairs if they wanted to hang out this
would ultimately lead up to Dougie B
taking the chain off of his neck and
recording the entire incident
[Music]
K flock of course would side with Dougie
B and the rest was history because of
this though Dougie B would actually
spend some time in jail for the robbery
with Dougie gone bee love and K flock
were still in the streets looking for a
way out but for an undisclosed reason
due to being a minor K flock was then
also put into a juvenile detention
center for a short period of time
with Beloved the only ones still holding
on to his freedom he began freestyling
over drill beats until K Vlog came home
when Flocka was released beloved sat him
down and told him he should really give
rapping his full attention and within
time he booked a studio session for him
where he recorded his first track on May
26 2020 K flock dropped that song which
was titled fto a remix to 22g's Blakey
freestyle the song amassed over a
hundred thousand views due to the hype K
flock had already been building in the
streets and now everyone wanted to hear
him rap 22gs even ended up giving him
props for the remix a huge success for
his first song one month went by and
beloved dropped his first official song
as well no hook which also saw about the
same success they now had a platform to
grow off of and put the Bronx drill
movement on the map dropping music at
least once a month and collabing on many
of them their names were quickly
becoming the talk of the city they also
made sure to shout out Dougie being
verses while he was still locked away so
his past music was also getting
recognized and gave him a small Buzz for
when he got out but with all the
attention they were now getting it was
also putting an even larger Target on
their backs every song became more
specific targeting different ops but
this is also what made it so popular in
the first place they made it a point to
help each other stay on track and no
matter what was happening in the streets
they had to keep recording music if they
were gonna make it out
Dougie B was released around August of
2020 and when he saw the momentum be
love and K flock I built up he quickly
rejoined the mix this is when things
would really start to take off kind of
like a trio except they all had their
own individual careers in March of 2021
the three of them dropped their song
brotherly love the first month it was
out it got over a million views and
really put them on the map I feel like
the famous
people from outside the city were now
tuning in and their fan base grew a lot
after this a big reason the music was
catching on was because they didn't just
copy the drill sound that Brooklyn was
seeing success with but rather they put
their own twists on it making it an
entirely new sound
[Music]
and although other Bronx rappers were
getting views too it was really these
three who took it to that next level
from here forward their songs were
easily Gathering millions of views every
time but make no mistake they were still
in the middle of a war things between
sebside the YG's and ogs was heating up
and the music was only adding fuel to
the fire for all sides unlike most gangs
that you've heard about in the past the
ones doing the most damage here in the
Bronx were actually kids from the ages
of 12 to 18. these kids are younger and
wilder than anything you could imagine
in their pulling triggers during this
time K flock was having beef with his
own cousin and rapper D thing just
because he was repping a different set
and that just shows how serious they
took it
but it's gonna be an RRP
then there was another situation with
rapper edot who at one point was friends
with gay as well after an Instagram live
showed eat out smoking and chilling with
kflox Ops their friendship was over as
well 16 with 2 million views they never
do that before all my Ops 18 19 20 21
I'll be for old great old no they're not
even my Ops I'm smacked I'm high y'all
know that they know my eyes
at this point it seemed like everybody
had a problem with everybody but again
every single one of them was benefiting
from these beefs Bronx drill had
everybody tuned in but at what cost in
July a 21 year old rapper named Ty swish
was shot in the head while outside of
his apartment complex two days later a
13 year old named jarion was chased down
and shot outside of a cafe in Belmont
yeah Joe it was a shooting that left a
13 year old dead and parents of
teenagers here horrified that someone
could do this the NYPD tonight is asking
for anyone within information to help
them find the killer it's not confirmed
but it's rumored that this was probably
retaliation for Tai swish's death from
just a few days before on July 11th
another 16 year old rapper named rajes
was getting into an Uber headed to a
studio session two kids on scooters
rolled up from behind him and shot him
rajes had been mocking the death of
jerion on social media just an hour
before around 11 30 Sunday night by the
corner of East 178th Street and Webster
Avenue in the Bronx police say two men
pulled scooters up next to a cab Medrano
was taking to a recording studio they
then shot him in his head and chest
killing him a Perpetual cycle of dissing
and then death was happening but while
this war was brewing between everyone K
flock Dougie B and B love were on the
brink of going mainstream something they
had been risking their lives for in an
attempt to make it out was finally about
to pay off
[Music]
let me
shortly after K flock dropped his song
being honest and he would get his first
collab from a mainstream artist when G
herbo gave him a verse following suit
Lil TJ and 504 and would also collab
with him on the song in the mood now he
was getting radio play on Hot 97 and
together with B love he walked onto his
first major show at rolling loud K flock
beloved and Dougie B would all sign
record deals shortly after with keflash
rumored to have been worth a few million
dollars now they had the money and
freedom they had been working hard for
but it's a double-edged sword the
dissing and Gang Lifestyle was partially
the reason they became so popular so
it's hard to just leave that behind at
this point but with money in his pockets
he was seen enjoying the Finer Things in
life taking trips to Miami riding around
in a new BMW and spalling his little
sister and girlfriend with shopping
trips but the money and fame only made
him an even larger target for his Ops
which means he now had to think twice
before doing anything in his home City
and you better believe they were
watching his every move
the morning of December 16th kfloc woke
up and was seen on live once again
taunting his enemies to come find him
but he made sure to let him know he
wasn't lacking as he revealed a gun
tucked in his belt hours later he was
walking down Amsterdam Avenue in 151st
Street a sheisty covered most of his
face but a 1500 Montclair jacket
unreleased Air Jordans and a fourteen
hundred dollar pair of Amiri jeans may
have still gave his identity away as he
passed by a barber shop surveillance
shows Oscar Hernandez comes storming out
to confront K flock although he walks
out of sight of the cameras for a second
we can assume threats were being made on
both ends after Oscar turned his back to
walk away keflak pulled the gun from
under his jacket and shot him twice in
the neck and back Oscar would die later
in the hospital while kefla quickly fled
the scene
was inside a barbershop when the gunman
opened the door and asked him quote what
are you looking at and the victim went
outside to confront him he was fatally
struck in the neck in the back because
he was so easy to identify and
investigators had access to surveillance
from multiple angles a warrant was
issued only six days later but the
police wouldn't need to look for him
on December 23rd K hired a well-known
lawyer named Scott Lima to represent him
they drove together to the 30th Precinct
where he surrendered himself in this
statement his lawyer describes that
police had received a tip that K flock
wasn't actually the shooter in the
surveillance footage but that was
quickly shut down he was denied Bond and
waited Behind Bars while more evidence
was collected by the police then in
March out of nowhere Kay would fire his
old lawyer and hire the same lawyer who
represented El Chapo a promising sign in
this Instagram post his new lawyer
stated that he was excited to work with
K flock and was confident he would beat
this trial
is you know I don't want to talk too
much about the details of the case that
the government claims that he pulled the
gun out and shot him but at the same
time the person that was dead on the
ground had his hand on a loaded weapon
illegal loaded weapon KFOG then posted
several updated photos with the caption
reading all good don't believe the blogs
or Internet everything trendy forever
DOA over the summer of 2022 his attorney
began to argue self-defense claiming K
had no intentions or premeditation to
murder oscar but instead feared for his
life after all he was in a dangerous
part of town and he was the one who was
confronted in the situation social media
had been supporting free k flock and
many believed tend to be released sooner
than later but his court appearances
were being postponed one after another
in November of 2022 fans tuning in would
explode when the courts made an error
showing his next court date to take
place in December of 2028 leaving many
to wonder if this was a mistake but
shortly after the next court appearance
was updated and corrected this time set
for November 16th but even that would be
delayed once again the only update the
world would get was a recorded phone
call of K flock dropping bars saying he
felt confident he would be home in 2023.
his next appearance was set for February
2023 and those tuned into the drill
scene were patiently awaiting for the
return of the Bronx biggest drill artist
instead what fans and kfoc would get
would be a wake-up call that no one
could see coming
oh
early on the morning of February 23rd
before Kay was set to appear in court
the federal government would release a
15-page indictment on him and seven
others of the gang Seth side under the
racketeering influence and corrupt
organization act or Ricoh charges and
these are very serious accusations
normally the evidence behind Ricoh
charges go back many years but in K
flock and sevsides case it was only two
years worth of evidence leaving many to
believe this was rushed in a desperate
attempt to keep K flock away and locked
up regardless the government had
gathered enough evidence against him in
his entire gang wanting to make an
example out of all of them due to New
York having some of the strictest
sentencing in an image to uphold New
York wasn't taking a liking to the image
that K flock and his music were giving
the city after all this is the home of
the stock exchange and some of the
wealthiest people in the country the
last thing they want is kids glorifying
murders in their City New York City the
not waiting for that you're not gonna
make the city where e-commerce and the
stock market lives look like a
crime-invested Haven to the rest of the
world and when you're now a rapper and
you're going on live to say hey I have a
gun and I'm chasing them down you're not
going to do it in New York City you can
do this in Chicago you could do this in
Houston you could do to Miami you will
never in life do this in New York City
now it suddenly made sense why KFOX
court day was being delayed what most
initially thought would be no more than
a few years quickly turned into a
minimum life sentence with the maximum
being the death penalty
neither K or his defense have responded
as of now only a few recent photos of
prison where K is seen here police are
now Gathering all seven indicted members
in kflox life hangs in the middle
he wanted to be the one who made the
change for everyone around him but at
just 19 years old he may have already
lost the chance of being a free man
yeah
I'm gonna be the [ __ ] that make the
change to everybody
[Music]
[Music]
will you see me

[Music]
hardly a shift goes by without a
physical assault police officers are
experiencing violence more and more
often now some German states are hoping
body camps may help deescalate that
trend worn on the uniforms the cameras
record the encounter and may discourage
potential attackers that's the idea
anyway
[Music]
mine's the skate capital of
rhineland-palatinate Gavin sheesh and
Stefan male are going on duty
the two officers carry a new weapon in
the fight against the increasing
violence and decreasing respect from the
public body cams the primary aim is our
own safety in other words we wear the
body cameras are preventative measure we
always carry them and we turn them on in
dangerous and tense situations to try to
influence the behavior of the people we
engage with almost every team is
equipped with the tiny cameras when they
go out on patrol the day's first call
involves bodily injury
Special Forces are already at the scene
the suspect is known to the police as a
hooligan with a record of bodily harm
forging checks narcotics possession and
resisting police officers this time the
suspect is accused of feeding a homeless
person police officers saw him do it the
suspect claims to have been defending
himself after a provocation it's his
second encounter with the police in one
day but he backs down the officers never
even turned on the body cam it's a busy
day in mites the weather is good the
home team has just won an important
soccer match the party mood and alcohol
increased the danger that the police
will experience violence soon in mind
says pedestrian mall Stefan Mel and
Gavin's fesh are called to take down a
charge of verbal abuse the accuser is
the same hooligan from before
he definitely abused me she said I was a
what did she say a weirdo and her
boyfriend said you not see buzz off you
with the red monster lips hey behave
yourself and stay close to me that's
enough you come back with me and remain
standing here in front even with prior
convictions for bodily harm and
resisting the police the man feels
they're treating him unfairly and I saw
what happened at the station and
obviously things aren't going very well
in town today you take a step back and
then we can talk
but the hooligan appears to have very
little respect for officer Stephan mail
you've already acknowledged what was
said so everything's in order so now
we're here to take down your complaint
you take a step back don't come any
closer on camera
as of now Stephan mail turns on the body
cam he's required to inform the citizens
verbally once again of the video
recording
basically what happened was that this
person was getting relatively aggressive
in my direction in particular so I
decided to turn on the body cam for
reasons of my own personal safety he was
getting too close to me and I wanted to
prevent that I was hoping that he'd
moderate his behavior and let the
situation deescalate a little and that's
just the way it seems to have worked
commenced it's after the initial
year-long test phase the officers and
minds have had overall positive
experiences with body cams they do seem
to help diminish a general lack of
respect
often you have a situation where people
see how far they can go they think they
can handle a police officer a bit
differently than they would otherwise in
situations like that it's important to
nip that in the bud and take direct
action and say okay up to this point and
no further when the police go off-duty
they hand the recorded video footage to
their superior officer he has special
software allowing him alone to copy save
or delete the videos where is your ID
your Marco and mr. Marco have you got a
last name the body cam records both
images and sound I'm not at all happy
that you're here ruining the mood now
I've got the camera turned on because of
the call is saying you're aggressive I'm
not why are you yelling here I'm not
yelling at all now I'm going to search
for your ID papers no I don't have any
ID on me hey are you deaf you dumb Pig
along with discouraging abuse the body
cams can provide conclusive documentary
evidence of crimes even of crimes the
police officers themselves have
committed so the body cams not only
protect the interests of the police but
of the citizens they encounter since
their introduction violence against
police officers has dropped by nearly
50% in minds but some criminal charges
are still filed that document extreme
hostility towards the police accused
behaved extremely aggressively
threatening to attack the officers after
he's released he spat on an officer and
insulted all officers present calling
them sons of [ __ ] saying I'll bang
your mother's on your graves the [ __ ] so
he is remanded to the custody of police
station 1 he's aged 16 to be picked up
at the station later by his parents and
the officers were only trying to stop a
brawl
in another case from two days ago the
subjects began resisting a female
suspect bit one officers arm and
another's face and struck another in the
chest to restore control over the
situation at least two other subjects
had to be pinned to the ground and
restrained
Girish we can only speculate as to why
disrespect resistance and abuse have
generally increased some wine for one
I'm sure something is lacking in their
upbringing their parents may be unable
to handle things these days and the
courts have so much to do that many
cases aren't processed completely by the
Tibetan current when things bother me
personally in court I have to put on the
Teflon and just take the abuse as a
police officer then you wonder if any
judge realizes what the current
situation is really like Elizabeth's own
sister showed shortly afterwards the
officers are back on the beat in
downtown mines when they drive past two
men one of them gives them the finger in
Germany it is illegal to insult an
officer we're running an identity check
because he's flipped as the middle
finger so we're checking them out you
can't do that it's not allowed if you've
had even a minimal upbringing you ought
to know that this kind of thing isn't
proper doesn't skirt for these officers
a line has been crossed can you explain
to me why you did that the brothers have
come to mines from Switzerland to party
do you give officers in Switzerland the
finger as well and how do they react do
they like it
the officers ordered them to leave they
have to vacate the area disrespect and
violence directed at the police has
soared dramatically in recent years
thirty-five-year-old stefan mail has
also had his share of these experiences
while on the beat at this site he once
had to handcuff a teenager who was
becoming extremely aggressive as I was
giving him instructions he turned around
and spat in my face you can feel this
incredible rage at that moment which of
course causes a really strong disgust
spitting in someone's face as many
fellow officers confirm is what provokes
you gets you worked up inside most of
all no amount of training can prepare a
police officer for something like that I
got rid of lots of rage and emotion at
that moment your human side really comes
out and it doesn't matter what everyone
around is thinking and seeing for a
moment your human self comes out and you
can't control it okay you're not just a
police officer that functions at the
push of a button no matter what it
always makes totally correct and emotion
free decisions I don't on a night shift
Stefan male and Gavin's fears have to
check out a group of teens everyone stay
here I'll be checking everyone's ID hey
you stay right down you calm down or
we're going to have to cuff you everyone
come over here find them all over there
the young men between the ages of 18 and
23 have no intention of letting the
officers see their IDs like that they
stall and provoke every way they can you
stand over there do I have to raise my
voice again that's a provocation when I
tell you to stand there five times and
you just don't do it
the officers tried de-escalation tactics
as long as they can without a body cam
you can't let the situation get out of
control you have to show people their
limits when they've reached the point
where we're not going to take any more
didn't do an oddish mega file awesome
I want to go home what are you doing
there you're sleeping in a Cell tonight
why am i sleeping there when an alcohol
test on me first opti call your mother
call her I didn't do anything he should
run an alcohol test
what are you doing you're grabbing my
throat
yes I'm buckling you in why buckle me in
I want to go home you can't do that man
shortly after the officers are called to
take charge of a man he was caught
trying to get away
the man is aggressive so the body cam is
switched on
now listen I'm turning the camera on
everything you say now will be recorded
you stay seated here and calm down who's
the racist missus is right I'm telling
the camera back on you know the way
you're acting here why me you're not
doing what we're telling you to this is
nothing to do with racists you're
spending the night in custody with us
climb in yourself no I really don't want
to bodily harm threatened assault and
resistance are hazards the police face
tens of thousands of cases annually have
been recorded throughout Germany the
numbers have been rising for years in
Mainz the negative trend was stopped by
the body cam

foreign
is 17 and Pregnant for the second time
teenage mothers are not uncommon in
Brazil especially in impoverished areas
many people are quick to pass judgment
they say all hope is lost any chance for
a future over
here it hurts who wants to hear that
their life is over
nearly half a million teenagers give
birth in Brazil every year making it one
of the countries with the highest number
of teen moms in the world
beautiful
[Music]
all ready for daycare
Victoria's due date is fast approaching
soon she'll give birth to her second
child almost every seventh baby in
Brazil is born to a teenage mother in
poverty-stricken areas like here the
rate is often much higher Victoria
doesn't like being labeled
everyone says what you're having another
baby everybody has an opinion about it
people say I won't be able to finish
school but my life is over but I won't
be able to do anything except sit at
home and watch the kids
she lives with her boyfriend Eduardo and
their daughter Lara in one of the many
favelas of Rio De Janeiro
Eduardo is 22 years old and trying to
finish High School
on the weekends he works in a snack bar
in the morning he takes their
two-year-old to daycare along the way he
passes the drug dealers who control the
neighborhood filming is forbidden even
life-threatening
Victoria was 12 when she met her
boyfriend she first got pregnant at 14.
they weren't using contraception
still she wasn't expecting it
the subject of contraception is still
Taboo in Brazil
former president bolsonaro and his
government even tried to restrict sex
education in schools instead he promoted
abstinence no sex before marriage that's
what churches preached to like many here
in the Favela Victoria's family is very
religious she concealed her pregnancy
from them until the last minute
I was so scared I thought my God I'm
only 14 and I'm going to be a mother I
was in shock I was crying all the time
and I was very very depressed
when she got pregnant the second time
she considered having an abortion
but doing so in Brazil is illegal and
highly risky
many still die from these secret
procedures conditions are often unsafe
because there's no access to
professional clinics
I'm back
Eduardo's occasional shifts at the snack
bar barely brings home the equivalent of
100 euros a month
welfare payments add about 150 Euros to
their income and half goes towards rent
their new baby dresser barely fits in
the one-room apartment and soon there'll
be a family of four
their financial problems are getting
worse
Victoria also tries to earn some extra
cash she makes house calls to other
girls in the favela
Victoria took a makeup course to turn
her passion into a profession
Al what kind of makeup do you want
something subtle love love
um
I earn a little money doing makeup that
helps a lot my dream is to open my own
Beauty Salon
but for now her career plans are on the
back burner so is graduating from high
school
she's in the home stretch of her
pregnancy
is one of around 400 000 teenagers in
Brazil who become mothers every year
even if these numbers are falling the
figure is still twice as high as the
international average in Brazil almost a
third of the population lives in poverty
thank you
in terms of population Brazil is the
seventh largest country in the world
with more than 200 million residents
social inequality is a huge issue the
affluent South zone of Rio De Janeiro is
worlds away from the reality of
Victoria's life
after giving birth the first time the
then 15 year old was referred directly
from the hospital to this NGO for social
services the Dara Institute is a center
for mothers in need including teen
mothers
social worker Katya Bauer helps the
couple set short and long-term goals
it's important that education doesn't
fall by the wayside so their job
prospects aren't limited when that
happens most Teen Moms find themselves
unable to escape the cycle of poverty
your daughter's only two yeah and now
there's another baby coming with two
children it gets even harder
Eduardo who said he wants to give his
daughter the life he did not have
been so it's time for you to reflect on
your family and think about
contraception
afterwards they have a consultation with
the doctor like most living in poverty
Victoria doesn't have health insurance
out of Shame she didn't get any regular
checkups until late in her pregnancies
the first time there were complications
common among teenagers
she needed a C-section to deliver her
baby
last time there was fetal distress with
your high blood pressure
her heartbeat dropped out
that means this is another high-risk
pregnancy
our goal is for them to become
independent and take charge of their own
lives we don't want them to require
another institution to do that
the Dara Institute supports mothers in
Social and financial need it's unusual
to see a supportive partner like Eduardo
here most here are single mothers
that's why the NGO also offers
vocational training that's compatible
with raising children cooking makeup
cutting hair Victoria has made use of
this opportunity as well presentations
and group discussions also provide
guidance and social support
you feel like you're in good hands
everyone here knows what's going on
we're all in the same situation and we
support each other
my dream came true a girl and a boy
ours too
Ria and Eduardo are looking forward to
the birth of their second child despite
the additional stress but without this
external support they likely would have
broken up as this the case with most
teenagers who become parents
we argued a lot but at some points you
need to work things out not only for our
sake but for the sake of the children
soon there will be two
they receive a bag with formula and
diapers
plus a grocery card worth around 40
euros
it's a vital supplement to the household
budget to get them through the month
[Music]
back in the Favela Moro de dendi in the
north of Rio
I didn't have a clue about anything my
daughter taught me many things because
becoming a mother so young is like
nothing else
she taught me to be strong to take care
of her to be a good mother to her
aren't you so pretty yeah yes you are
there
Sunday is Family Day they visit
Victoria's grandmother she lives just a
few houses away
we're not allowed to accompany her on
the street with the camera the armed
drug dealers in front of the door do not
want to be filmed
Victoria grew up with her grandmother
when Victoria was three months old her
mother left her here and ran off with a
new partner
this loss left its mark on Victoria
she sees it as one of the underlying
reasons she became a mother at such a
young age
I missed my mother's love I wish I'd had
a real mother of course my grandma is
like a mother to me but I still miss her
anyway
and I wanted to prove that I could be a
better mother than my mother was to me
the fact that Victoria got pregnant
before finishing school disappointed the
whole family but her grandmother Sonia
Oliveira did not turn away which often
happens to other girls
people say you have to kick her out
don't support her but I do support her
as long as we're alive we will help her
now it's up to her if she finishes
school
somehow the family holds together
despite the strain of various conflicts
and their tight finances
even Victoria's mother has re-entered
the picture the birth of her
grandchildren has brought her and her
daughter closer
Larissa is also part of the family her
newborn is her second child too
the baby clothes I was given are too
small for him I'll bring them to you
Larissa also became a member when she
was still
the family prays for a brighter future
foreign
[Music]
Ty is through education and work
I'd like to study medicine
I still want to get my high school
diploma I want to work a lot and leave
the Favela and give my children a better
home to me
I'd also like to have a small beauty
salon because it's something I really
enjoyed
[Music]
selfie at Sugarloaf Mountain this is Rio
de Janeiro Victoria and Eduardo don't
let Bleak statistics deter them
we're hanging in there she's doing her
job and I'm doing mine to provide a
better future for our kids in a few
years
[Music]
I want to give them a better life work
hard to give them the best
[Music]
and with that Victoria says her family
planning is complete before her 18th
birthday everything else will follow
even if the way forward is not so easy

[Music]

a brand new city to call Home Berlin has
been a big change for Amit and yogita
kamlapur there are among some 10,000
Indians in the last year alone who've
moved to Berlin it's a chance to make
new friends from familiar places they
may come from all over India but are
bound by a shared culture and memories
and a need to support each other that's
the beauty of this place that everyone
comes together but not as you know
different communities but as one
Community we follow Amit on his journey
to make Berlin
[Music]
home the slower pace of life that's the
first thing Amit kamlapur noticed in
Berlin life in the German capital is a
far cry from his bustling hometown of
Pune in India back home Amit felt like
he was always on high alert always in a
race to an unknown Finish Line but here
he gets to
breathe it's quite rewarding you can uh
focus on your on self be it health be it
learning it's a historic city um by by
all means and it's great to be here meet
meeting people here the experiences how
Berlin has changed now are a part of it
so it's a yeah a great feeling for us
rituals are becoming important to Amit
too he never performed this morning
prayer or Puja back in India it was
always his mother's task now in Berlin
he finds comfort in this Hindu
ceremony as does his wife
yoga it's always a great start uh for
the day and just puts you probably in
the right mood right right track for the
day finding the right place for this
piece of home even played a part in
their house
hunt we visited a lot of Apartments of
course Berlin is a difficult Place
difficult City to get an apartment in
But whichever apartments that we visited
the first thought used to be that okay
where where is the place for our ritual
for our
Puja homecooked Indian meals are a
comfort too a lentil pancake here a
special nutty Hala for dessert there it
makes amit's first time living away from
his parents a bit easier turned out
really well I don't think I'll be able
to study after
this but the move to Germany has also
been a new chapter for their
relationship their first independent
home to
themselves we knew each other before we
got married but you know when you live
all by yourselves you are trying to
battle the daily struggles right from
you know which cupboard should we choose
how should we manage the finances it's
an allog together new um way of
understanding your partner in a
different way yeah I think uh the bond
between us has kind of like grown
stronger and deeper that way so that's
what Berlin did to us I would say in in
a sense Amit a data analyst and yoga a
product manager are amongst a surge of
Indians who have moved to Berlin
recently an estimated 10,000 have
arrived in the last year alone some are
students many like Amit and yogita are
young
professionals Germany is in the process
of easing requirements for work visas to
draw Talent from countries like India it
remains a popular choice for those
looking to immigrate despite the
challenge of the
language we have Mana we have man the
way they speak the way we pronounce it
is quite different and then therefore it
is we say ah we couldn't understand
anything and that's where we really uh
struggle in the listening part right
yeah both Amit and yoga took up studying
German in their universities back home
in India years later it made their move
less
daunting Amit liked how the language
sounded but that wasn't Germany's only
draw Germany is uh something a little uh
close to us my my father he studied
mechanical engineering so he always had
this in his mind that okay German
engineering German working culture so
that kind of also built up the whole uh
narrative for us that okay maybe we can
try
Germany yog Echoes amit's feelings about
a better work life balance here that's
how you learn right we're always in
India you know on our toes so there's
always something where there's some sort
of Silent race that we are always
running and I think uh the here in
Berlin or in maybe in Germany outside uh
the two of us we we learned to set sit
back and you know relax for a while it's
it's okay to take a break breaks
Outdoors are of course getting a bit
harder to take one thing we find a bit
still difficult is the weather so even
even right now it's a little cold for us
fortunately the couple have found warm
this evening they visit their new friend
the
gamber hello he moved to Berlin 5 years
ago everyone here heals from their home
state of
Maharashtra they share a common language
food and festivals so you're coming for
that Diwali program yes yes yes I I
heard there are a lot of programs there
are going to be like six six or eight
Diwali celebrations
in cooking in eating familiar Foods
together plays a big part here the
friends prepare some vas a popular
Indian snack made of potatoes luckily
Indian groceries are easily
available it allows for a taste of
home we knew how it is to be in the new
city new place and you know and when we
see someone uh you know from our our
area our country and you know getting
connected just to be there for them it's
a great great feeling and kind of um
reassuring for us that we are now part
of this big community and that's why we
feel at home some of the people here
moved to Berlin three decades ago these
connections are a handy way to learn the
ropes from dealing with German
bureaucracy to finding each other new
apartments for amth the gamber and his
wife dsha now feel like family and
offering that comfort to the couple is
important for the
hosts I always think when my daughters
grow up and they go some in some other
country for education or jobs or
anything uh if they feel lonely it will
be really bad so that is my motivation
to always connect to new people and make
them feel that comfortable so yeah that
so yog hasn't been home since their move
she says her and amit's families are
very grateful to this New Berlin family
you would never visit in the last one
and a half year I think we are giving
them too much love that they do
not their parents started cursing us
now yet they don't want to isolate
themselves we don't want to live here uh
in ghettos yeah because that's that's
not uh why you you come to a new country
you come to a new country uh to explore
to uh integrate to learn their culture
or maybe also impart some of yours and
impart ing Indian culture is a key part
of the intention behind the Shri Ganesha
Hindu temple in
Berlin this is the entrance of the
temple which will called as a
rajagopuram it has been started in 2009
on the the temple has been a pet project
for wiat and Krishna morti a member of
its executive committee he explains the
unique details of the structure with the
passion the Hindu gods on the facade the
way Temple Artisans flow in from India
worked for years to carve every detail
right here but it's also caused delays
that is a reason we are waiting because
in the cold country's time the Indian
workers cannot work the Indian workers
working with with a bare hands so that
they're telling this cool too cold for
us another reason for delays is the
financing of the project it relies
entirely on donations only in the past
limited funds have held up Construction
now in its 14th
year will be but with the surge of new
arrivals and a growing demand for a
place for worship and
rituals the finish line is finally in
sight getting the donations the Indian
Community before 20 years it was very
less now it has been increased double
and double so we are now in the better
position to get the uh donations to
complete the
temple it's the finishing touches now
the floor heating for the cold winter
and the final deities will be brought in
from India by SE Krishna morti says the
inauguration is planned for next summer
have you heard the song but already the
grounds of the temple are a place of
togetherness hundreds gather on a cold
November evening to celebrate Diwali the
Hindu festival of
lights Amit joins in as well with his
wife yogita Al ready on her way to India
for their first visit home the temple is
a place to celebrate the festival with
the community
instead and this is already a familiar
place for Amit every month he attends
prayer Gatherings
[Music]
here he says it gives him comfort and
confidence to be here
Namaste Namaste very much wish you a
very happy diali happy Diwali sir
happy happy that Indian community grows
up of course and it's always warm to be
here it feels very homely very close to
our home our
country organizers say everyone should
feel at home here even if they are a
curious passer by that's why entrance
costs for these events are kept low says
Krishna morti everybody's welcome
because our Temple is open for everyone
not only for the
Hindus over 25,000 people of Indian
origin now live in
[Music]
Berlin there are 10 times as many spread
across
Germany sharing their culture is
important for
[Music]
them that's the beauty of this place
that everyone comes together but not as
you know different communities but as
one community and that's what uh I've
always loved about back in India and
here also so that really kind of makes
me feel that okay there is hardly any
differ Diwali is the most important
Festival in the Hindu calendar and this
is amit's second Diwali away from
[Music]
home he's excited about being on his way
to India soon for his first visit since
his
[Music]
move it's a trip he has waited for for a
long
time but it's been a much easier wait
than he'd
[Music]
expected

welcome to Everglades National Park my
name is Ryan Meyer I've been a ranger
here for about two years and this is an
amazing place
it's a vast vast place as well a
wilderness that encompasses a million
and a half acres as you can see a
glimpse of that wilderness right here
where where I'm standing at a place
called Royal Palm the place during the
winter months especially from roughly
November to April you can see dozens of
alligators you can see wading birds fish
turtles an incredibly diverse array of
wildlife in one small area as you drive
down the main Park Road you'll see signs
for lots of short easy trails most are
about a half of a mile a piece
the mostar boardwalk trail some very
easy accessible and fun for for the
whole family
one of the best things about coming to
the park through the homestead entrance
or passing by the Ernest Coe Visitors
Center and driving from here all the way
to flamingo is that you can literally
see every habitat type that we have here
in the park right now in the Everglades
and it's just the beginning of February
now but from December all the way
through April Everglades National Parks
hosts an amazing array of migratory
birds especially water birds that come
to the park feeding and even nesting
this time of year when we think a little
bit about how the Everglades works right
now this is the dry season here in
February and so the water levels are low
across the park that concentrates fish
into small areas so if you're going to
raise a new family of hungry chicks
you'd probably rather do when the food
is concentrated rather than when it's
spread out across hundreds of miles of
Everglades so here in the park you'll
you'll see lots of alligators in fact
sometimes even on the way to the park
you're going to see lots of alligators
especially around State Road 41
alligators live primarily in fresh water
I say primarily because of course
wildlife doesn't follow the rules many
times that we set forth for them so
you'll find alligators in brackish water
a little bit salty water sometimes but
the brackish water the salty water is
primarily the domain of the American
crocodile and these creatures live only
here in the very very southern tip of
Florida they are more rare to see than
alligators but you can't see them down
in flamingo the park is home to
to thousands of species and for the most
part we let nature take its course
you know if an animal is getting chased
by another animal about to become dinner
we don't interfere that's nature and all
these animals here in the park even if
they're right next to the trail they're
not tame they're not our pets they're on
their own to find their food and survive
in this landscape the only exceptions
are endangered species we do monitor
closely and at times intervene in the
lives of endangered species but it's
pretty rare I think it's a mostly a
monitoring effort and trying to restore
the habitat that works best for those
endangered species so for example the
Florida panther very very few Florida
panther here in Everglades National Park
scientists tell us maybe around eight
cats that's it now in Big Cypress north
of us there's many more maybe 30 maybe
50 cats in that area so quite a few more
to the north but not many here in the
southern part of the Everglades before
humans arrived this ecosystem what we
call the greater Everglades ecosystem
started around Lake Okeechobee in fact
even a little farther north in the
Kissimmee area just south of Orlando
water fresh water from rain water
percolating into the ground into this
rock in Florida called limestone begins
to flow South goes above ground and even
underground in that limestone that holds
water
and allows water to move through it
incredibly slow one drop of water might
move maybe 300 feet in one 24-hour
period that one drop of water from Lake
Okeechobee might take almost one year to
make it all the way to Florida Bay to
the tip of Florida and into the ocean
that flow of water that river of grass
or that fresh water flow has been
altered now most of the water in fact we
can now say all of the water that flows
from the north is in control of people
we control every drop that flows north
through water control structures gates
canals and much of that water goes
straight out into the ocean as you think
about activities whether it's in your
backyard if you live here or if you are
from across the country or across the
world there's lots and lots of things to
do here in the park I would definitely
check out our website and PS gov forward
slash ever that will give you a lot of
information about what's available to do
here but you can certainly enjoy again
fishing and hiking biking canoeing
wildlife viewing just mean lots and lots
to do here you can also give us a call
three oh five to four to seven seven
zero zero and we have some friendly
folks that will help you kind of sketch
out your trip
you
you

I will teach them lesson I show them T
Joshua wanted to write history for
himself he want them to serve him he
want to rule over them and my brother he
did it a disciple of T is a slave t i
was a disciple of T Joshua for 10 years
from 2001 to 2010 I stayed in that place
till 2013 so was that 12 13 years that
that I was there inos I was 16 or maybe
even 15 when I first visited um and then
I stayed for 14 years it was a
psychological prison we all thought we
were in heaven but we were in hell and
in Hell terrible things
happen God
pleas our Black Disciples they suffered
so much he beat you without
messy you thought you were in the safest
place in the world and you were in the
most dangerous it is time for
healing hello people of god good morning
good afternoon good evening I greet you
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ um
pleas forgive give the quality of my
videos this time around my camera
charger has a has an issue I have an
issue with the camera charger and um
that is why I'm using my my laptop now
but I will fix that very very soon so
the video we are looking at you're going
to is um the reaction proper from uh The
Synagogue Church of all Nations as the
respond to BBC on the recent documentary
that was done on TV Joshua now the title
is characters in BBC's documentary on TB
Joshua unknown to us synagogue chur hey
hello I want to play that you watch this
video till the end if you don't watch

I am talking about in this video thank
you and God bless you all right good
morning good afternoon good evening this
is the end time TR television channel we
urge you to subscribe to the channel
activate the Bell Icon by selecting all
so that the next time we upload a new
video you will be among the first
persons to be notified by Google I'll be
seeing you in the next video till then
Shalom at The Synagogue Church of all
Nations scan yesterday countered the BBC
documentary on the late
Baba Joshua known as T Joshua founder
ofan scan described the documentary
against TI Joshua as unfounded and that
the characters interviewed in the report
were unknown to the church now this is
when I I heard this one I had this point
I was like no that is not true if the
persons because this is a blatant denial
a making people think that those in the
video never come across or never we in
The Synagogue Church of all Nations we I
have not been to Synagogue Church of all
Nations as a member you know I've not
even met T Joshua once but there is
something that we cannot deny you know
evidence that these people the men and
the women who were interviewed there at
least that documentary alone showed when
they were younger and when they were
serving even as um TV crew members all
those were there so for them to say that
the characters interviewed in the report
were unknown to the church is the
beginning of a terrible lie that will
continue the church in a statement by
its public affairs director Mr Dar adore
said the statement was aimed at
disabusing in public Minds from the
report now recall that the BBC released
a highly controversial and the damning
documentary on the late C Joshua on
Monday accusing him of various crimes
including rape against some members
reacting to the documentary scan said
that to investigate and publish a
broadcast reports was a central canel of
Journalism but to do so outside the
ethics and fundamental principles of the
profession was an auration now I also
saw in the video that BBC said they
reached out to the church for them to
prove this or counter it and they
claimed that making spous and unfounded
allegation against T Joshua was nothing
new and so in that sense the they kind
of rejected the opportunity to defend to
to refute or to affirm the stories so
the statement reads BBC World Services
investigative unit could named Africa
eye came out this week with weird and
strange episodes of atrocities against
the late founder of scan BBC has
compromised this lofy principles by
descending into fictional narratives and
propaganda thus turning itself into a
weapon for a hashed job as gangsters in
the gap of journalist with a destructive
ulterior motive for personal gains
against a perceived enemy was T Joshua
really an enemy of the BBC or maybe
enemy to some of the disciples who came
out only the BBC can best explain why it
wul deviated from the journalism and
chose to be dishing junk and feeding the
public with stones C bread by its
offensive and disenchanted reports of
disg gruntled elements this to say the
least is insulting to our professional
and public intelligence one thing is
very obvious hundreds of BBC chariots
cannot rubbish the indelible footprints
of TI Joshua's legacies on Earth again
those beneficiaries are all over the
place and cannot be disputed they are
lining up and responding angrily to this
imperialist broadcasting station many of
them are in in the UK the home base of
the BBC B which its jist investigative
eyes can not see but only the subborn
narrators myriads of broken homes
reconciled by TB Joshua are also crying
foul of BBC's broadcast of inequity
uncountable hopeless children drawn from
different parts of the world some
brought by their parents While others
were picked from drug joints or BRS who
have gotten their Destinies restored are
also pissed off by the offensive reports
BBC has shut itself in the fruit by its
compromise and roadside journalism it
said the BBC would not have lost
anything if it had gone to the church
even in these guys as visitors to have
direct experience of what was happening
in the church instead of relying on the
gruntled and manipulated individuals
some of whom were never known before in
scan now this is just what I don't
understand who actually amongst them was
never known in scan I really do not
understand so this defense is making the
whole matter worse I tell you I they
kept mute for some time but coming out
to this this kind of defense is
worsening the issues now saying some of
those people who amongst them can they
actually pinpoint the because we saw one
of the the the five stories Brothers you
know we saw him with a tag in the church
an old picture as an AER this is a place
a system where you have nobody to talk
to and there was nothing I could do
where the first story buers are the ones
covering him these are children of 16 17
years he kept all of us in slavery total
absolute slavery during the day he was
an user maybe at night he served as the
five story brother I mean the ladies in
question we saw them we saw them we saw
them in Services some of them having
microphones preaching as well and we are
all here living in The Synagogue Church
of All Nation as evangelists in training
under our father in the Lord senior
Prophet heie Joshua he was really Keen
to use us on the videos to endorse him
and to get the endorsement of the
western world and you are joining us
here at a synagogue church for Nations
after a wonderful Sunday service and I
felt like we all had this truth we felt
the world needed TB Joshua can you tell
us what do what is your opinion of the
man of I've got Prophet T have you seen
push them to go and interview so that
people outside will see that oh
synagogue is doing something new TB
Joshua he was happy he was really happy
never doubt it he is the man of
God he was just like a
Peter and all the whole disciples were
pets he had the strings what can you
tell us about your experience here my
experience has been awesome at the
beginning we look really bad and like
malnourished visit she started asking
questions so then it was like well you
guys have to dress really well we had to
do all our makeup we had to look good we
know that you've just had the wonderful
privilege to join us here at The
Synagogue Church of all Nations on our
Sunday
service whatever you know whatever you
think you are no matter the degree you
have we have a system that will break
you down being a disciple um you lived
under a really strict set of
rules Lord Jesus
and you know some of the wise men have
actually reacted and responded and none
of them had had questioned the or the
truth of some of those people
interviewed ever being present at scan
now remember I just did a video where I
questioned actually one of the
characters that was actually interviewed
now I didn't question her being in the
church but her stories that looked a
little bit contradicting but these
people here are doing a lot of damage to
the stories now blatantly deny in these
uh people some of them is making the
matters worse we saw bisa on the floor
the her old video when she was brought
and was
humiliated I will teach them lesson I
show them wanted to write history for
himself he want them to serve him he
want to rule over them and my brother he
did it a disciple of is a slave t i was
a disciple of TB Joshua for 10 years
from 2001 to 2010 I stayed in that place
till 2013 so was that 12 13 years that
that I was there in Lagos I was 16 or
maybe even 15 when I first visited um
and then I stayed for 14 years it was a
psychological prison we all thought we
were in heaven but we were in hell and
in Hell terrible things
happen God
please our Black Disciples they suffered
so much he beat you without
messy you thought you were in the safest
place in the world and you were in the
most dangerous it is time for healing
and B dly accepted that that was she all
right a was I mean are we talking about
AWI who was in that video that they
could say wasn't part of The Synagogue
Church in the first place or maybe the
person that wrote this thing just came
to synagogue he he just collected a
contract to write this in order to
confuse young minds that are not you
know thinking they the thoughtful mind
he said some of those identified are
relics of homosexual and Les Associates
my findings further show that everything
the BBC put together is strange to scan
yeah there was one of the ladies who
said that even what brought her to the
church was because he was finding it
difficult to identify herself you know
this thing this thing D call it crisis
of ident identity you know identity
crisis so the the young lady was having
crisis identity but she also said that
daddy came and told her to open up and
her clothes we saw her we saw her we saw
her younger younger personality and she
was not actually helped so so if she
came to the church as um being confused
as per who she was whether she was a
woman or a man open say she was gay and
the daddy could not help her really by
the spirit that he was working with at
least to identify who she was and
eventually she has got her own path
believing in that thing that brought her
through the SCH in the first place all
right so let me repeat it again it said
some of those identified are relics of
homosexual and lesbian Associates my
findings further show that everything
the BBC puts together is strange to scan
what the logical thing in the Char is
the BBC's categorical statement that t
Joshua a man of God was involved in all
the abuse for over two decades okay
let's say maybe he did it while he was
starting so as point in time he stopped
if that was the case you should tell us
that that was the case that he stopped
okay he did it early in the his ministry
he did it but at some point in time when
he has shaved his beards and was looking
very very neat and handsome and he
stopped if that is what we trying to put
across to us F we will understand how
can that be in a nation governed by law
it shows the stations C disrespect and
bizer perception of Nigeria my friend
stop that we know we in Nigeria we're in
Nigeria and we know the high and the
mighty can escape from anything we know
we know we know we know how it works in
Nigeria we are all in Nigeria we all in
Nigeria that somebody can I mean stop
stop saying that I beg which Nigeria
which Nigeria we're talking about this
Nigeria this Nigeria that even the
government does not believe the rule of
of law the court will give an order a
judgment and the persons who are
supposed to be custodians of the law I
mean who are supposed to respect the law
to lead by example that the law must be
obeyed and respected they defy the court
others how many of them have forget that
one where were all those Shameless
interview interviews in all the decades
was it when the man passed on that they
suddenly became aware awake or came back
to their senses only a fool we have
respect for such charlatans I want to
remind you that bisa and Paul has have
always told these stories they have told
the stories and even while T Joshua was
alive remember so uh this is the their
response but I just want to close with
the fact that a lot of these persons may
not have come out out of fear that they
might be killed or that they might not
survive it like bisa and um survived
it I want to tell my story to say that
look it's not easy but you'll be okay
you can come out of this and you can
heal and you can find life again
after what kept me quiet was and fear is
an illusion proud of myself for Having
the courage to tell the truth about who
this man really was my son the fact that
I I have two kids is a miracle because
of the trauma experience it's not been
easy but despite all the crying and
being upset and being upset about
friends family still there I'm so grate
to be out I'm so grateful just to be
[Music]
free
I I go through my my days where I'm at
my lowest turned honestly I just want I
just want more Peak Tranquility
stability I lost everything my home my
family but for me it comes down to the
truth and for as long as there is breath
in me I'll defend that until the very
end I we only came out recently because
he too was afraid you know of his life
and these are things that
that can be proven so um if I if I was a
member of the think tank in synagogue
instead of this kind of lame explanation
and defense would have been better they
didn't say anything being silent on this
give you some time after all TI Joshua
is is gone he's dead and there are
stubborn followers that will never ever
you know clinch their their support for
TB Joshua all right there are so many of
them that don't think they just want to
go ahead and and I have some of them as
friends too Who Loved TB Joshua the TB
Joshua that they knew on the on the
television screen the TB Joshua that
they saw on the podiums on Crusade
grounds the TB Joshua that they saw on
that big altar at The Synagogue Church
of all Nations now that was the T they
knew they loved they fell in love with
and they are still loving so if you you
knew that you actually had nothing
upstairs because this for me is is dumb
it's not it's not is a lame defense it
was better it would have been better to
keep mute give it to me one month two
months 3 months you know highest one
year it will die and then you you you
keep doing your thing you keep doing
what you are doing in the synagogue you
may not have been part of it you may not
have known some of those people who you
claimed were never known thisan but have
you asked Evelyn and Evelyn says that
she never knew many of those people
interviewed well thank you everybody and
God bless you let's know what you think
about about this in the comment section
we see you in the next video till then
from me to you before I sign out I also
you know put out my sheet for those that
will come to attack and to you know do
what T Joshua followers know how best to
do and that always will make me question
this so-called love that TB Joshua uh
preached because the preaching that did
not affect you preach the message of
love that you heard but it never
affected the way you see life that
loving showing love and giving love
makes you all of you will claim that TB
Joshua was attacked attacked attacked
and he never attacked anybody so you are
now his um his foot soldiers that will
attack those that attack him and the
Lord give you understanding in Jesus
name I'll be see you in the next video
to then from me to you

in the autumn of 2014 Hong Kong became
the site of pro-democracy demonstrations
after the Chinese government announced
plans for electing the city's next chief
executive was the people of Hong Kong
would be able to vote candidates would
be vetted by an election committee and
would have to love the country and love
Hong Kong the refusal to allow open
nominations fell short of the promised
one-person one-vote elections and people
took to the streets in the fight for
what they called true democracy
pro-democracy supporters the existing
chief executive CY Leung has no popular
support we'd call him 689 because he has
only got 689 throws and he's there to
rule Hong Kong and we want him to step
down and then we want a true democracy
without candidates pre-selected by
Beijing that's our long-term go
we cherish democracy but it's Goldman
warming these people really said about
the city is that some people they just
don't have the courage to fight back
they don't have the courage to stand on
defeat but that's not everyone in Hong
Kong some of us still fight another
Center of protest was one got in the
Kowloon Peninsula which was seen by many
as more volatile than the Admiralty
district in terms of Cantonese we
thought it warm Goff and Wang means a
very lively vibrant very good in
business kind of area Golf is a corner
so it means it's a very vibrant corner
here
[Applause]
protesters used the singing of happy
birthday to upset his attempts to
clearly hear you
[Applause]
they really shouldn't have reopened the
road
because there was just more congestion
they were sending ambulances through
when they knew there was a protest going
on service is going to be the lathe
they're just going to be some physics
against the protesters again
just quick with the point
[Applause]
after almost three weeks into this
movement I can tell the police very high
and mentally they are being courted so
much as temple sprayed he's moved in
using pepper spray and buttons to clear
protesters from the corner of Mayfield
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
from an evening when protesters have
regrouped and taking control of large
sections of one but the leaders saw hope
for homecoming I want to say Hong Kong
is full of tales right now because the
government has destroyed the faith the
relationship between definitely people
and I just want to say to a hometown
people
Shia and hold that word because we know
that hope is coming right now the Sun is
rising and I want to tell those people
that
oversee keep reinforcing Hong Kong we
need your help

when the American war for independence
broke out thirteen of Britain's North
American colonies opted to sever ties
with the mother country however some of
those colonies chose to remain loyal and
afterwards would go on to form the
Dominion of Canada thus the question is
why didn't Canada join the American
Revolution before continuing it's
important to stress that in 1775 Canada
didn't exist it was instead comprised of
the colonies of Newfoundland Nova Scotia
Quebec Rupert's land and Saint John's
Island bar in Quebec the differences
between the peoples of these states and
those of the thirteen colonies were no
more or less stark before it can be
determined why all of the colonies
didn't leave it's necessary to know why
the thirteen that did leave chose to
break away in the first place much of
the anger directed at Britain was due to
the idea that the recent acts of King
George the 3rd and his Parliament
violated the rights of Englishmen this
is why the province of Quebec had no
interest in revolting since you know it
wasn't English speaking of Quebec it was
itself one of the reasons for the
revolution the Quebec Act had expanded
the size of the french-speaking colony
and granted freedom of religion there
which did the Protestant
english-speaking colony surrounding them
was terrible
for Quebec it's options were to stay
with Britain whom they didn't exactly
like but who granted them rights and
more territory or to the rebels who
despised them but what about when the
French began to help the Americans
didn't Quebec want to go back to being
under French rule well no being a
British colony gave Quebec access to a
much larger international trading market
and also to put it bluntly the French
didn't really care about it anymore
another reason for the American
rebellion is what are known as the
Intolerable Acts things like the Stamp
Act the Sugar Act and the quartering act
took away rights and privileges that
American colonists had previously held
which shockingly upset them the taxes
that Britain imposed were done so
without the consent of the Americans
leading to cries of no taxation without
representation to which Britain's
response was to people living in Britain
itself barely have representation so
what makes you so special
also mass financial problems across the
colonies combined with the ban on
expanding westward in order to prevent
war with the Indians meant the
revolution wasn't too far away some of
these acts combined with economic issues
negatively affected the peoples of the
later Canadian colonies just as badly
unlike the 13 colonies though the
reaction wasn't quite as fierce there in
places like Rupert's land and Saint
John's Island the acts weren't quite as
important since their economies relied
on natural resource extraction
whereas in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia
the acts were just as disruptive these
colonies did see some resistance
two British policies Nova Scotia had
close ties to New England that much of
its population were immigrants from
there
thus they too were angry at the new
taxes and this anger culminated in a
couple of riots but ultimately no more
than that much of this was down to the
province being much less urbanized and
so what little resistance there was
couldn't be organized quickly Nova
Scotia's economy was also reliant on the
British military since Halifax was a
garrison town which played host to many
Royal Navy vessels another factor which
secured their allegiance was the British
troops were needed to fight off Indian
raiding speaking of which raiding by
American privateers during the war
drastically soured the relationship
between Nova Scotia and the thirteen
rebelling colonies had guaranteed
further the Nova Scotia would remain
loyal to Britain as for Newfoundland
many of its residents were fishermen who
would either relocated from Britain
recently over there for a season to work
and thus inclusion in the British Empire
was necessary for their livelihoods
whilst Newfoundland had many problems
similar to those in the American
colonies its distance meant that it
lacked a sense of solidarity with those
to its south
thus they saw themselves not as
colonists but as being entirely British
and most their believes that their
problems would not be solved by
political separation there were two
other important reasons for Nova Scotia
and Newfoundland remaining loyal the
first was that the elites of the
colonies hadn't lost any money from
Britain's actions like those in save the
junior of Massachusetts
they were mostly naval officers whose
income came from their own lands back in
Britain and whose position relied on
loyalty reason number two was a simple

- [Narrator] When an adopted
daughter decided to reconnect
with her biological
parents, she had no idea
that it would be the worst
decision of her life.
Although she may have been looking
for a rekindled relationship
with her family,
that relationship would
take a disturbing turn
for the worse.
What is up, EWU Crew?
Today we will be following the
destructive series of events
that turned a man into
a cold-blooded killer.
They say blood is thicker than water,
but when it comes to this
case, it will be proven
that father doesn't always know best.
Let's get into it.
As a young man in his early 20s,
Steven Pladl groomed an underage girl
from San Antonio he had
met over the internet.
He decided to make the trek
from his home in New York
all the way down to Texas
to meet the young girl.
The year was 1995, and the
girl was 15-year-old Alyssa.
The pair's parents didn't stand
in the way of their union,
even though Alyssa was
still a child at the time.
The two continued their relationship,
and Alyssa soon became pregnant
just two years after meeting Steven.
On a January day in 1998,
the young 17-year-old Alyssa
went into labor, and together with her
soon-to-be-husband Steven
welcomed a little girl
into the world.
Alyssa allegedly witnessed
Steven physically abusing
their infant daughter,
who they named Denise.
According to Alyssa, he
would pinch Denise so hard
that he would leave bruises
all over the defenseless baby's body.
If that wasn't enough,
she claimed that Steven
would even trap the baby in a cooler
and diabolically wait
until almost all the oxygen
had run out before releasing her.
But these were sadly only just
a few of the alleged abuses
his daughter would experience
at her father's hands.
Fed up, Alyssa stepped in and did one
of the hardest things a
mother could arguably do.
She decided to give her
baby up for adoption
so that her eight month old
could live and be happy.
Steven and Alyssa's
daughter Denise was adopted
by Anthony and Kelly
Fusco, who were described
as very kind and open-hearted people.
They renamed the baby Katie,
and she was sent to live
with them in their happy
home in Dover, New York.
There, Katie would grow up to
become an artistic young lady,
on her way to college.
All the while her birth parents,
Steven and Alyssa Pladl,
remained together and had another daughter
nearly 10 years after giving
up Katie for adoption.
Alyssa felt that they were
older now and more mature
and therefore more capable
of raising children.
They had a total of two
children, both daughters.
While the couple raised their two girls,
tension between the pair increased.
Alyssa said her ill-tempered
husband's behavior continued
throughout their marriage saying,
"He would destroy things in
the home when he was upset,
punching holes in the walls."
Making matters worse was the claim
that Steven could not hold a steady job
for nearly eight years,
leaving the burden of providing
for him and their two children
on Alyssa's shoulders.
Steven's unpredictability caused
great concern for his wife.
Alyssa would later describe
Steven's true character
by saying, "I was always on eggshells.
Whatever his mood was, everybody knew.
And that mood was often not happy.
A lot of yelling, a lot of
things smashed in the house,
in front of our kids."
Joy returned to Stephen and Alyssa
when they received a notification
on their social media accounts.
It was from their firstborn, Katie,
who was now 18 years old.
She had turned to the internet
to help her track down
her biological parents,
and was successful in locating them.
After trading messages,
Katie changed her plans
of studying art in college.
Instead, she moved down
to Henrico, Virginia
to live with her newly-found
biological parents
and younger sisters.
Katie's adoptive parents
were wary of the arrangement,
but decided that she was old enough
to make her own decisions.
Familial bonds were
formed, but Katie's arrival
would only push Steven and
Alyssa's marriage further apart.
Steven's behavior changed
whenever he was around his daughter Katie.
Alyssa even pointed out
that Steven attempted
to make himself look
younger by shaving his beard
and changing up his wardrobe.
Noticing the growing kinship
between Katie and Steven,
Alyssa felt the need to
disclose to Katie the abuse
she had suffered at
the hands of her father
when she was an infant.
But the news didn't faze Katie.
Instead, the father and
daughter grew even closer.
Things between Steven and
Katie took an awkward turn
when the 40 year old started sleeping
on the floor of Katie's bedroom.
Growing concerned by the
situation, Alyssa asked Steven
why he felt the need to sleep in her room.
He became confrontational
and stormed out of the house.
Steven's affection for his daughter
had transcended normalcy.
They had fallen in love.
In November of 2016, still on unaware
of her husband's and daughter's
intimate relationship,
Alyssa moved out and filed
for a divorce from Steven.
They split the custody of
their two younger daughters,
and Katie stayed in the home with Steven.
Now with nothing in their way,
Steven and Katie continued
their incestuous relationship.
It wouldn't be until the following May
when Alyssa would finally
realize the extent
of the affection between
her now ex-husband
and their oldest daughter.
It was a bombshell journal entry
that detailed the unnatural relationship.
The entry was written by Steven
and Alyssa's 11-year-old daughter.
The young girl wrote, "Katie is pregnant.
Dad says they feel like couples.
Did they get a little
too drunk that night?
My dad is a (muted)."
Adding, "He's Satan, he's (muted) Satan.
He'll go to hell, but he won't
be the one getting tortured.
He'll be the one torturing people."
In the journal, the young
girl drew pictures of
both her dad and sister,
portraying them as demons.
The entry concluded
with, "Wait one second.
If he's Satan and Katie is a human,
then the baby will be half demon."
Horrified about learning
of the twisted love affair
and the pregnancy, Alyssa later recounted,
"I lost it, I started screaming.
I felt like I was going to throw up."
She then said that she immediately called
and confronted her deranged ex about it.
He responded, "I thought
you knew, we're in love."
Alyssa replied, "How could you?
You're sick, she's a child."
Alyssa tried to save
her daughter once again
by calling the police to
report the now known incest.
Although police interviewed
the two younger daughters,
neither Steven nor Katie
were placed under arrest
and they continued living
together under the same roof.
On the warm summer day of July 20th,
Steven and Katie decided
to take their relationship
to the next level.
They traveled to Maryland to get married.
Father and daughter
marriages are not legal
in the State of Maryland,
so the couple lied
about being related on
their marriage application,
and as a result, were able
to legally tie the knot.
As if the wedding wasn't
already disturbing enough,
in attendance were Steven's mother, Grace,
alongside Katie's adoptive
parents, Anthony and Kelly Fusco.
They can be seen in many
disturbing photos smiling
and appearing to enjoy the wedding
alongside Steven and
a very pregnant Katie.
Apparently, Anthony and
Kelly Fusco only attended
because they felt that all they could do
at that point was support
their adopted daughter
in her decision once again.
A few short months later,
on September 1, 2017,
Katie gave birth to a baby
boy, whom they named Bennett.
However, the happiness
of their new marriage
and young son didn't last long.
Steven and Katie were arrested
four months later in January
and extradited back to Virginia.
Police administered DNA
tests on Steven, Katie,
and their son Bennett to
confirm their familial genetics.
The two were officially
charged with incest,
adultery, and contributing to delinquency.
In court, Steven Pladl's attorney tried
to justify the unlawful
marriage by explaining,
"This case is an 18-year-old
girl who shows up
at the doorstep of a 40-year-old man
who's going through difficult
times with his wife.
They have a bond because
they're biologically related,
but they never knew each other
before they had a sexual relationship.
He was head over heels in love with her,
so much so that that outweighed the issue
of them being biologically related."
Steven was able to post
bail and was released first.
The judge ordered him
not to leave the State
of Virginia and to not have
any contact with Katie.
However, the court did
not deny Steven access
to his son, Bennett, who
was placed in the care
of Steven's own mother, Grace.
To leave the boy with
Steven's mother, who was 72,
was described by Alyssa
as a "shocking failure."
She continued, "Steven
shouldn't ever have been allowed
back to North Carolina where
he had access to his house,
his weapons, the baby.
I can understand they like to put children
in the hands of relatives, but not Grace.
She wouldn't have been able
to stop him seeing the baby
even if she wanted to."
Katie was later released on bail
and was also ordered not to
have any contact with Steven.
She decided to move back in
with her adoptive parents in New York.
However, Katie broke the no
contact order and called Steven
and told him that she wanted
to end their relationship.
Heartbroken, Steven did
not take the news well.
All he had left in the world
was Katie and the baby.
Things then took a devastating turn.
On April 11, 2018, Steven
went to his mother's house
to pick up his infant son Bennett,
telling her that he was
going to take the baby
up to New York to see Katie.
His mother didn't try to stop him.
She couldn't have imagined that
handing over the little boy
would be a death sentence
for the helpless child.
Steven took the boy to
his home in Knightdale,
North Carolina, where he strangled him
and left his tiny, lifeless
body shuttered away in a closet.
This was only the beginning
of Steven's murderous rampage.
He left the house and
proceeded to drive 600 miles
through the night up to New York,
where he had planned to confront Katie.
In the early hours the following morning,
Steven arrived at the home
of Anthony and Kelly Fusco.
He sat and patiently stalked the family
from inside his blue minivan.
He was familiar with the
Fusco's family routine,
and he knew they would eventually leave
to visit Katie's adoptive
grandmother in Connecticut.
As expected, Katie and Anthony
emerged from their house
and pulled out of the driveway
in their Toyota pickup truck.
Steven followed closely
behind in his minivan.
Steven couldn't hold
back his rage any longer,
and when the Fusco's truck came to a stop,
he pulled up beside them
and began firing upon them.
With every shot fired,
he unloaded his fury
onto Katie and Anthony Fusco,
killing them both in cold blood.
An off-duty firefighter was
there to witness the massacre
and was the one to make the 911 call
to first report the double killings.
The firefighter described the
horrific scene to dispatchers.
- [Dispatcher] 911, what's the
location of your emergency?
- [Caller] Hello, this is a Connecticut.
It's on Route 7 and Route 55.
Someone just went by and
shot this guy in a truck.
- [Dispatcher] Somebody just
shot somebody in a truck?
On Route 55, sir?
- [Caller] Yes, the beginning
of Route 55 and Lewis Avenue.
Just happened.
I'm a fireman out in New York.
The car pulled up, went
around him, shot him.
A whole clip full into his head.
- [Dispatcher] Okay, sir,
are you still with him?
- [Caller] We're here at the road.
- [Dispatcher] Right at the intersection?
- [Caller] Yes, sir,
right at the intersection.
- [Dispatcher] Okay, sir.
- [Caller] He's deceased.
The truck's in the middle of the road.
- [Dispatcher] He's dead?
- [Caller] Yes, sir, his
brains are on the road.
- [Dispatch] And he was shot.
Did you see the person who shot him?
- [Caller] Yeah, we pulled
up, there's a whole, yes.
- [Dispatcher] Okay, which
way did the vehicle go?
- [Caller] Headed toward
New Milford, down Route 7.
- [Dispatcher] Down Route 7.
Can you describe the vehicle to me?
- [Caller] It's a blue minivan with,
I believe, a South Carolina plate.
- [Dispatcher] Blue minivan,
South Carolina plate?
- [Caller] Yes, sir.
A light blue minivan.
- [Dispatcher] Okay, sir,
just stay on the line with me.
- [Narrator] 911 dispatchers soon received
another phone call.
This time it was Steven's mother, Grace.
In the call Grace described
what Steven had just confessed
to her, telling dispatchers
about the dead baby boy
and how Steven had
killed Katie and her dad.
- [Grace] He killed his
wife, he killed her father.
And I can't even believe
this is happening.
- [Dispatcher] Okay.
- [Grace] He left the
baby dead when he left.
- [Narrator] Steven's mother
cried out to the dispatcher.
Five miles from the scene of Katie
and Anthony Fusco's slaying,
police found Steven's vehicle,
but Steven was in no
condition to be arrested.
He had shot himself, and his
motionless body sat slouched
in the driver's seat
of the running vehicle.
Steven's ex-wife Alyssa
eventually looked back
on the events and said,
"It's been a difficult
roller coaster of emotions,
because I'm so devastated
by the loss of Katie and
her adoptive dad and baby.
But it's such a relief
that I don't have to look
over my shoulder anymore
to see if Steve is there."

to support so far no luck
Raj Kumari is one of the hundreds of
thousands of Indian women in
institutionalized sex work in a practice
with roots in the age-old caste system
[Music]
just three hours away from India's
capital New Delhi is a starkly different
world
I'm traveling to a cluster of villages
known for sex work
this is gay goalie a village in the
district of alwar in the state of
Rajasthan
here I meet Ankita who is a sex worker
at her request we have changed her name
she says she's of legal age but doesn't
look it
Ankita is getting ready for a client her
clients include men from nearby Villages
truck drivers or migrant workers that
pass through on the highways and young
men with disposable incomes
she joined the profession three years
ago and says it was by choice as it
enables her to support her family
I know from my father that my aunt also
worked like this I got into this field
due to poverty
how much are you earning at the moment
about 60 to 70 000 rupees per month
around 750 Euros apart from me no one in
my family can find work we were starving
we need a roof over our heads we need to
build a house and my sister needs to get
married
do you have any debt I paid it all off
how much was it about 11 000 Euros
oh that's a lot did you pay that back
yes everything within two years three
years
[Music]
having to borrow money traps many
families here in a vicious cycle
Banks do not lend money since they do
not consider sex work as work
so these families turn to local lenders
who charge exorbitant interest rates
making them even poorer
we also changed her real name is the
eldest of a total of seven siblings due
to high debt she also has to work as a
prostitute like her mother and her aunt
I was 15 when I understood what it was
all about
and at the same time it became more and
more clear to me how poor we are
so I got in
what was the situation
my little siblings always had to beg for
food we have no real house no land
nothing
at some point the money that my mother
earned here as a sex worker didn't
suffice
so she had to go to Mumbai
in hotels you can earn more
she had to leave us alone to do so
it became clear to me that it was the
only way to make money and essentially
for us to survive one day I finally said
to her I don't want you to do this I
will take care of this I am now the
breadwinner of the family
rashna went to Mumbai through an agent
who recruited her by contacting local
pimps in an elaborate sex trade Network
there are an estimated 3 million sex
workers in India between ages 15 and 35.
sex work is legal in India pimping and
human trafficking are not
this is a matter of survival for many
like rachna they are abused in the
system but stay for lack of any other
avenues of work
Bombay man
when I was very young I had a client in
Mumbai who treated me horribly
he wouldn't even pay me
instead he beat me black and blue and
even stole my clothes
I ran after him but couldn't take them
back
it was extremely humiliating
there is a stigma attached to these
Villages as the people here belong to
the bottom of the cast iron key
[Music]
where these women come from have
traditionally been nomadic tribes
they move from place to place they're
scattered all over but many are in the
states of madhya Pradesh Rajasthan
haryana and uttar Pradesh
before the women were driven into sex
work these ethnic groups worked mainly
as performers dancers jugglers acrobats
and magicians
because of their work and way of life
the British colonial power viewed these
ethnic groups as a threat
in 1871 they were criminalized under the
criminal tribes act which was only
repealed at the time of India's
independence
stereotypes about these tribes still
persist in society and makes it almost
impossible for them to start other
professions or means of livelihood
I went to meet male members of a family
from the community
there's a lot of discrimination no one
wants to give us decent jobs that would
mean we could climb up and out of our
misery people don't want that so there's
no change
how do you determine that how is this
noticeable in everyday life
they won't even stand or walk next to us
because we belong to a low cast
they tell us to go away but it's getting
better as more and more of us push to go
to school
otherwise they wouldn't let us come near
their homes
in school nobody would sit next to me I
wouldn't even show my ID card fearing
retaliation and humiliation because of
our cast
some children here don't know who their
father is of course the mother's
customers don't give names
but this is a problem because in many
places you can only be officially
registered with your father's name so
these kids fall through the cracks
but women have been able to challenge
some gender roles by becoming the
primary breadwinner
those who make money are strong our
women are strong they support the family
they call the shots
the women are ahead of us here they are
immensely respected
these women are able to bring income to
the families build properties and make
homes they can pay off Family debts
which not many women in India can do
some eventually leave the village and
move to the country's major Urban
centers to Delhi Mumbai or Calcutta some
even as far as Dubai
husbands fathers and brothers of the sex
workers are involved in enabling the
street and contributing to the family
economy they act as pimps but also do
house chores and raise children
but there are women who are completely
on their own this can be difficult
especially when they get older snail ATA
only had one daughter who also worked as
a sex worker then she died probably from
a sexually transmitted disease
I don't have any other kids she died she
got very ill
most of the women we spoke to would like
to move on from this life
Ankita dreams of marriage when she's
done helping her family
does everything to give her child a
decent education which she hopes would
weigh her way to Freedom
however something is slowly changing in
The Villages
I meet guddu nagar a teacher who is
supported by an NGO working to end sex
work
creature
today's lesson is about grammar he
believes a good education will help the
women find safer ways of employment
[Music]
big foreign
and these families no woman works as a
sex worker
gudu nagar belongs to the same tribes
his relatives were in the sex trade too
he wanted to break the cycle he started
by teaching himself to read and write
and then his relatives
our nomadic way of life was one of the
reasons it was too difficult for us to
escape our misery I have four brothers
none of whom went to school and some of
my sisters are still illiterate
after I had taught myself a few things a
social worker from an NGO helped me
today I have an official degree and can
work as a teacher yeah
there are stories like this but few and
far between
members of the community are trying to
change the destiny of the Next
Generation
sentence
I'm Nancy and I want to be an air
hostess one day why an air hostess it's
my dream because you want to fly yes
A desperate hope is simmering that
through education and knowing their
rights these women can leave the
shackles of the past

back in a nice house making
[Music]
money

if your free soloing it is about perfect
execution or certain death hello i'm
choi Vasarely I'm a documentarian
my name is Jimmy chin and I'm a National
Geographic photographer and filmmaker we
made free solo together and we are going
to talk a little bit about how we
captured the first free solisten ll
captain
the thing about L cap is that it is huge
it's 3,000 feet tall and it's almost
hard for the mind to comprehend the idea
of climbing it without a rope was just
really beyond most people's imagination
Alex shows free-rider on El Cap because
even as a professional climber if you
are to be able to climb free-rider what
we call clean which is without falling
that would be a lifetime achievement I
think alex is certainly the first person
to consider it seriously well we were
always more interested in Alex as a
character study then as a free soloist
per se I mean Alex began free soloing
because as a kid it was scarier for him
to speak to another person and ask them
to be his partner than to go out by
himself and without a partner and hence
without a rope it was very dangerous but
alex was doing we really had to trust
ourselves and how we would handle the
material and how we would handle the
story and I think Alex did trust us with
that we understood of these 3,000 feet
that there were four or five pitches
that were critical to the story the free
blast slabs which were difficult for him
psychologically as well as physically
the boulder problem which is the crux or
the hardest part of the climb and then
then dura corner so we always had the
climb covered from a long lens but our
manpower they're kind of running in
between these five places the way we
approach the film which was critically
important was building the team we
needed elite professional climbers that
were also incredible filmmakers and
cinematographers meaning there's only
about three or four people in the world
you can call each one of our cameramen
was
you know 45 pounds of equipment
sometimes 50 pounds of equipment and
they're also carrying you know 500 to a
thousand feet of rope you are moving up
filming but you're also pulling your
lines out of the frame and clipping them
off to hear yourself so as you move up
you're gaining more and more weight and
trying to manage more and more equipment
and rope you know we use very specific
equipment that allow us to let go of the
brake hand and the belay device self
locks so you can kind of let go of the
rope and not slide down the Rope any
further you know we are also doing
different moves where somebody else is
kind of lowering out the cameraman and
they're able to get kind of a moving
shot on the wall
the free blast is a notorious section on
the free rider route it's extremely
slippery and the holes are the width of
two quarters on their on their edge it's
the kind of climbing what we call
friction climbing where you don't really
have real footholds it's just the
friction of the rubber on the wall and
it's very very insecure climbing the way
that we shot it was to emphasize the
friction climbing and the footholds
because it's all about footwork there
it's very technical footwork and also it
was important to our story because it
was on the free blasts that he fell so
the free blast was like psychologically
as well as physically quite challenging
for Alex the boulder problem pitch was
one of if not the biggest concern for
Alex people start to understand you know
how choreographed all of his moves are
and I think that was something we really
wanted to get across to people and that
there was a psychological situation
there too with Alex my galaxy's thought
deeply about his own mortality but he
did not he was not interested in dying
in front of his friends and also he was
acutely aware that any camera man would
feel I mean would feel profound fear in
that moment and that there's a
reflection that happens where Alex would
feel his fear so the compromise was
remote cameras
the trick actually was that we needed to
get them firing and we weren't sure how
long the batteries would last we weren't
sure if we actually got it until we came
down downloaded everything and watched
and it was maybe one of the highlights
of the entire production when we were
sitting there waiting and waiting and
watching and then you see this person
coming up into the frame and then you
know we get to see him do the boulder
problem pitch the karate kick and
there's that moment when he looks to the
camera and smiles and we all almost fell
out of our chairs when we saw that the
derry-o Corner is an extraordinary
looking pitch and the difficulty is that
the holes are vit not very good so
they're kind of rounded the only way
that you can stay on the climb is by
pulling with your arms and pushing with
your feet it's also a very long pitch
meaning your arms get very very tired
very quickly that pitch alex climbed in
probably less than ten minutes maybe
even five minutes people often take an
hour that was a pitch that we really
wanted to cover well because of its
difficulty and because of the aesthetics
the way we covered that is I was off to
the side and then we had another
cameraman above that pitch shooting what
we called down the barrel so I had a
still camera both to the tough of my
film camera and while alex is climbing
the Enduro corner I was also taking
stills that I was filming him coming up
I couldn't see Alex because he was
around the corner probably a hundred
feet away but I knew he was moving
quickly I know that from the ground you
you all could see the valley floor and I
kept on one point I was like Alex you
cannot give Jimmy a heart attack yeah
he's trying to move so fast
alex is shooting up and we're kind of
paralleling and at a certain point the
roots intersect again and I see Alex
coming up he's got this huge smile on
his face because he's through all the
most technical difficulties and he's
coming along and I say to Alex can you
give me 60 seconds
he just looked at his phone and said I'm
about to break for hours and I knew what
that meant
he was not going to wait he's so happy
he's alive Alex lives every day of his
life with intention he's doing exactly
what he wants to do with his life but
there's also this misperception I think
where people think oh he's a free
soloist he has a death wish
that's not who he is if he was a
daredevil or a maverick we wouldn't have
been interested in making the film it
was actually his process and his
discipline it was kind of the perfect
storm for a documentary film but the
real kind of existential issues lay and
the dangers involved in his courage he
was connecting with people which i think
is one of the more moving parts of the
film

making movies and shows is more
complicated than you may think
long before the cameras start rolling
there is a considerable amount of prep
work that goes into finding the correct
landscape
actors script writers directors makeup
artists computer graphic artists
camera crews and the list goes on in
this video
we'll go over a general overview of how
today's movies
and high-end television shows are made
and some changes the industry is making
in a post-coronavirus world to take
advantage of today's best technologies
welcome to movie university on this
channel we explore various aspects of
the movie entertainment industry

making movies is something that's been
around since the turn of the 20th
century
while the end result of entertaining
audiences has always stayed the same
the methods of how things are done
before
during and after may surprise you let's
take a look at how movies and television
shows are made
it all starts with an idea about half
the time
someone will pitch an idea about a movie
to a movie studio
other times someone from within the
studio will come up with an idea and
shop it around inside the company and
seek approval
studio executives and bigwigs will weigh
the arguments of the movie
some of the things they'll consider are
cost of making the movie or show
audience size for who wants to see such
a product potential earnings at the box
office and rentals
chances of it becoming a breakout
interested parties in favor of
financially supporting a project
and the reputation it will give the
studio after a while deciding on whether
a project should or should not be
greenlit
scripts are written this can take
anywhere from a couple of months to a
couple of years
during either the proposal process or
script writing creative differences can
pop
up causing staff members to leave the
project sometimes
these result themselves in the form of
another but similar movie
being made and being released around the
same time from a different studio
once the script is finalized
pre-production ramps up in earnest
filming locations are scouted camera
crews are brought in makeup artist
booked
secondary directors hired lighting crews
found costume department and computer
graphics specialists are all hired to
make the movie
while traditional film location scouting
still occurs
a great deal of technology has helped
step in to allow directors to see
what locations or virtual sets will look
like
today locations can be scanned into a 3d
environment by a small local team
the data can be sent wherever a director
and his staff are
allowing them to recreate the location
in the virtual world
this allows them to have an idea of what
challenges they will encounter
if they choose to use this location some
things to consider
are what equipment to bring how to work
out logistics of bringing their
equipment
food water and personnel and ankles to
place the cameras for ideal
shots another area that is seeing a boom
are visual aids and sets
while you may know that hollywood likes
to use a lot of green screen to make
epic looking sequences
one thing that is changing is the use of
massive electronic screens that wrap
around a set
one of the first movies that used this
extensively was oblivion with tom cruise
in 2013.
however since then big productions like
the mandalorian
have used the large screens to help
envelop actors with a sense that they
are actually in their environment
on top of saving time on the backend of
post-production special effects
this helps eliminate the need for green
screen technology altogether
for large swaths of the movie saving
time and money
camera resolutions and screen pixelation
have come to the point where the human
eye cannot tell the difference when
watching the finished product
once principal photography is complete
the raw footage is sent to computer
graphics specialist to add in details in
the movies on top of video editors to
chop up the footage into the final
product
during the editing process the editors
will also adjust the scenes to match a
particular color palette
while all of this is happening there are
also sound editors who are working hand
in hand with the video editors to add
sound effects
from here directors will give their
opinions of scenes and hand instructions
to support editors
or directors to make changes once these
changes are made
a more finalized draft is sent to the
music composer of the movie
where a musical score is placed into the
timeline
once a director feels comfortable with
this draft it is sent to executives at
the movie studio to screen the movie
they will give their feedback for
changes they believe will be better for
an audience
sometimes reshoots are required costing
studios millions of dollars
as was the case with rogue one and
justice league
after several back-and-forths on this
the movie will be tested in front of a
small showing of volunteers from the
general public
based on their feedback the studio may
decide to make changes
or allow the current version to be
released from here
a special screening is arranged for
movie critics to allow them to write
about the movie in newspapers and
websites
drumming up interest and giving the
movie some free publicity
this is where you come in based on box
office returns and audience ratings
studios may then decide to create
sequels as was the case with the john
wick series
what's your favorite part about the
movie making process do you have
aspirations to work in hollywood
let me know in the comment section below
this is movie university
education in cinema
you

everybody loves a good documentary sure
films are great but if you can learn
while being entertained
that's just a novel plus for example did
you know that the dots on top of a
lowercase letter J is called a tittle
there you go
doesn't that feel good to have learned
although to be fair a common mistake
perhaps is to believe that the word
documentary equates to truth the format
is after all subjects are just as many
lies and deceptions as fiction films are
but whilst some might see the
potentially dishonest nature of the
genre to be a flaw you could certainly
consider it to be one of the
documentaries greatest strengths its
ability to combine truth with art to
create something more something that
resonates and maybe even changes the
world there are thousands and thousands
of documentaries out there which makes
creating a list of 20 essential films
something of an exercise in futility
that said there are certain
documentaries that have had a noticeable
impact on the world the medium of films
and everything in between with that in
mind on will for culture and here are 20
documentary movies you must see before
you die
number 20 cartel land everybody knows
that there is a huge problem in Mexico
with drugs but cartel land released in
2015 to critical acclaim and an Academy
Award contender shows audiences aside to
that war that they may not have known
exist
that is to say Matthew hyneman's
gloriously cinematic documentary hones
in on vigilante groups on both sides of
the border who have taken it upon
themselves to fight back against the
cartel the result is a film that doesn't
necessarily give any answers or
solutions but puts viewers right in the
middle of the action including a few
gunfights as they're permitted to tag
along with two groups out to protect
their countries at any cost
number 19 zero Dreams of Sushi it might
seem strange to suggest that a
documentary about sushi makes for
essential viewing rest assured however
that watching David Gelb's film for just
a couple of minutes we'll have you
utterly convinced the reason for this
aside from the beautiful aesthetics is
all down to the subject Jiro Ono who's
often thought to be the world's greatest
sushi chef aside from an endlessly
fascinating character Jiro also happens
to be 85
years old he is unrivaled in his craft
and operates out of a tiny 10 seat
restaurant the people from all over the
world travel to visits after booking for
their table months in advance Jiro is a
perfectionist beyond all measure even in
his older years and watching him as he
creates and cooked sushi as if it were a
true art form is mesmerizing stuff
number 18 hearts of darkness a
filmmakers apocalypse
without question hearts of darkness a
filmmakers apocalypse is the definitive
documentary about the making of a motion
picture forget about the infamously
nightmarish shoots of films like jaws or
Blade Runner it all pales in comparison
to what Francis Ford Coppola had to deal
with during the making of his
masterpiece Apocalypse Now and it's all
here to witness in hearts of darkness if
you've ever thought about making a movie
this documentary will definitely make
you think twice about your ambitions
aside from the ever-increasing costs of
the film hearts of darkness details all
the major problems that plagued the
production of Apocalypse Now from Martin
Sheen having a heart attack to Coppola
threatening to blow his own brains out
number 17 man on wire sometimes a
documentary highlights a subject so
unbelievable that it near enough blows
your mind man on wire which chronicles
one Frenchman's madcap attempt to cross
the gulf between the two towers of the
World Trade Center using a tight rope is
one of those documentaries you really
have to see it to believe it
constructed like a heist movie man on
wire tells the story of Philippe Petit
an eccentric French trapeze artist who
decided to complete such an astonishing
feat of endurance in 1974 and the real
Wonder is that it took until 2008 for
someone to make a documentary about it
pieced together with humor and a real
affection for its leading man man on
wire is one of the most relentlessly
watchable documentaries ever made number
16 to be and to have such a sad and
poignant documentary is to be and to
have whilst also managing to be
beautifully observed and endlessly
uplifting at the same time well not as
well-known as some of the other films on
this list to be and to have hones in on
a small rural school in the French
countryside and the lone teacher mr.
Lopez whose unique methods inspire the
single class of children all of whom a
mixed age
between four and twelve mr. Lopez's
approach to teaching is truly touching
he respects his students and cares for
each and every one of them individually
nothing really happens in the film its
greatness stems from the way that it
depicts the day-to-day life of a group
of individuals and highlights mr.
Lopez's remarkable approach number 15
blackfish for years people went to Sea
World and countless other aquamarine
parks under the impression that the
animals there were cared for and looked
after blackfish is the documentary that
changed everything exposing the horrors
that take place behind the scene of
these theme parks of which so many
people were plainly oblivious to so much
so in fact that the backlash resulting
from black fish's release prompted
SeaWorld to announce plans to phase out
its world-famous Orca show number 14
Hoop Dreams Roger Ebert's named hoop
dreams of the best film of 1994 if that
isn't a good enough reason to go and
check it out immediately what is shot
over the course of five years and culled
from 250 hours of footage hoop dreams
tells the story of two African American
high school students who dream of
playing professional basketball this
gripping 171 minute documentary hooks
you in and refuses to let go as soon as
you're introduced to the two
protagonists you're invested in their
stories this isn't just about basketball
it's about life number thirteen last
train home last train home is the sort
of film that makes you feel very very
lucky shot over the course of several
years this documentary details the lives
of Chinese migrant workers who travel
annually to their homes to celebrate the
new year's holiday given that there are
a hundred and thirty million of them
their exodus makes for a harrowing and
often horrifying portrait of a way life
is experienced by a huge amount of
people aside from the many stunning
images of mass migration the makeup last
train home the film strength lies in the
way that it presents the dire
circumstances attaining to individuals
and their families in China number
twelve Grizzly Man without question
Werner Herzog's greatest documentary
film to date Grizzly Man is a harrowing
look at an individual who decided to
take on nature and paid the consequences
with his life while most
cumin trees in the man versus nature
vein tend to hone in on ill-judged
expositions to mountainous regions this
one concerns bears narrated in his in
expressive and often drawl bra variant
accents grizzly man tells the true life
story of one timothy treadwell a man who
came to be so obsessed with the animals
of the movies title that he went and
lived among them his mistake of course
came in his belief that he was one of
the Bears a viewpoint that ultimately
the Bears did not share and led to his
death it's easy to mock someone like
Grizzly Man but Herzog refuses to take
that path and if anyone understands the
connection between man and nature its
Herzog the result is a picture that is
unashamedly respectful of its subjects
as a portrait of an individual and a
Herzog Ian parable it's a real
masterpiece
number 11 Grey Gardens Grey Gardens is
just about the strangest documentary
ever made or at least its eccentric and
extraordinary subjects are two of the
strangest people ever directed by David
and Albert Maysles the film chronicles
the lives of two women both named Edith
Bale a mother and a daughter who live
out an incredibly weird existence in a
dilapidated mansion based in New Hampton
how they got this way provides one of
the film's big questions though the
documentary never answers this in a
particularly conclusive way once
incredibly wealthy both are now shown to
be living in relative squalor with very
little money at their disposal there are
cats and cat feces everywhere and
raccoons frequently invade the house as
for their own personal relationship
well it's quite sweet but admittedly odd
number 10 planet Earth okay so it's
planet Earth it had to be in the top ten
narrated by the great David Attenborough
and the most expensive nature
documentary series ever commissioned by
the BBC Planet Earth revolutionized what
a documentary could be it is just
incredible to watch animals doing their
thing in some of the most spectacular
settings on the planet
add to that a killer soundtrack by the
great Han Zimmer in Planet Earth - and
you've got not only the greatest nature
documentary of all time but also by far
the chillest
television you can watch outside of bob
ross and of course it reminds us all of
the essential lesson that we must take
care of our planet's no
nine Bowling for Columbine Michael Moore
is admittedly considered to be something
of a joke nowadays but there's no
denying that Bowling for Columbine
arguably his most famous film is a
documentary that absolutely everybody
must see in the film which centers
around the Columbians school massacre
that occurred in 1999 Moore explores the
relationship between Americans and their
guns and asks whether the country paved
the way for such a thing to happen Moore
takes a somewhat heavy-handed approach
at times and there are a few cringe
inducing moments scattered throughout
and yet it's hard to call this
documentary anything other than a pop
cultural milestone not only did it
influence the style of countless other
documentaries and helped to fashion a
new irreverent style but even more so
than many of the better films on this
list it has launched itself into the
public consciousness around such a
delicate and controversial issue number
eight The Cove positioned as a heist
movie of sorts The Cove is a remarkable
and gripping documentary that chronicles
a crack squad of activists who set out
to expose a secluded Cove in Japan where
every year hundreds of dolphins are
lured in and brutally murdered directed
by a former dolphin trainer who turned
against the industry and became an
activist much of The Cove is dedicated
to an intricate mission to plant secret
cameras in the film's titular location
as the Japanese attempt to thwart the
project the director and team are forced
into covert ops mode and must conduct
their business at night using stealth
and state-of-the-art equipment but it's
the latter scenes of the dolphins
actually being killed and the shots of
the water as it changes color from blue
to a vibrant red that will truly haunt
you in the aftermath number 7 crumb
Robert Crumb is exactly the sort of
person who deserves his own documentary
because what else do you do with a man
who apparently masturbates to his own
cartoons but that's not even the
weirdest part of crumb a picture that
really does have to be seen to be
believed
as the film moves forward it turns out
that the name of the film doesn't
necessarily just refer to Roberts there
are two other crumb brothers both of
whom are even stranger and more confused
and disturbed than the egotistical
artist of the title dark disturbing and
incredibly funny crumbs shocks and
entertains in equal measure as all
cesare introduced to the irreverent
cartoonists strange work and home life
number six don't look back Bob Dylan is
one of the most famous and influential
people to have ever lived and is often
credited with birthing modern music as
we know it love him or loathe him it is
futile to rally against old Bob and his
legacy and given that it felt necessary
to include a musical documentary on this
list as to cover all bases there is no
better than don't look back
shot in 1965 don't look back is an
intimate portrait of the then
twenty-something folk singer who was
well on his way to becoming a true icon
and phenomenon the documentary follows
the singer as he tours Britain and
though it's supposed to be a factual
work there's a sense that Dylan is
playing up his persona for the camera
number 5 the act of killing and the look
of silence
technically the act of killing and the
look of silence are two separate films
but they are so important to one another
and so heavily interconnected that it
seems appropriate to class them together
the documentaries focus on the
Indonesian genocide that took place
between 1965 and 1966 a period of
history that's considering how many
people died has received a shockingly
small amount of coverage the acts of
killing is by far the stranger and
perhaps more harrowing picture of the
two not least because the director
tracks down and interviews those
responsible for the killings who now
boast and walkers freemen today and
asked them to reconstruct their crimes
for the camera which they do of course
and happily but then something starts to
happen to charismatic killer Anwar Congo
as he slowly begins to come to terms
with his past number for Sands Saleh as
far as documentaries are concerned sands
saleh is a true original it's hard to
pin down what exactly Chris Marquez
insanely creative motion picture
actually is is it a travelogue a parody
of the documentary format a meditation
on memory what is for sure is that sands
Saleh is a joy to behold and that
there's nothing else quite like it as
the movie hops around the globe and
flicks between subjects observing
moments and rituals at a relentless pace
a woman narrates over the top of the
images as markers own surrogates
transferring his thoughts to a piece the
hits on and on
lievable amount of ideas and themes as
an ode to the imagination there are a
few that can beat this film number three
the thin blue line without a doubt one
of the most influential documentary
films ever made the thin blue line
centers on the arrest and conviction of
a man named Randall Adams who was
accused of murdering a police officer in
1976 the film changed the way that
documentaries were perceived and paved
the way for a new generation of
filmmakers the thin blue lines use of
reconstructions was deemed to be
revolutionary at the time as the lines
between feature film and documentary are
blurred many of the documentaries that
audiences take for granted today were
influenced by Morris's approach but
perhaps the most interesting thing about
the thin blue line is the way that it
paved the way for an innocent man's
release number two man with a movie
camera often misidentified as the first
documentary ever man with a movie camera
might as well have been it has the
associated sense of all that one might
attribute to such a thing as the titular
man and his camera take to the Soviet
streets in a madcap attempt to capture
absolutely everything and anything in
1922 indeed the camera in this
documentary is perhaps the most curious
of its kind there is no plan here so to
speak but each image tells a story of
its own the level of detail visible in
each and every shot is remarkable then
again what else do you expect from real
life
number one night and fog every person on
earth should see night and fog at least
once a film that was almost never made
at just 30 minutes night and fog sets
out to paint the Holocaust and the
concentration camps as an absolute truth
essentially the movie consists of a
series of still images played with a
narration by Michael bouquet his voice
filled with a repressed kind of anger as
life in the camps is laid out bare for
audiences to see the images are graphic
as across its short running time the
pain and suffering experienced by those
put into the camps is frankly depicted
we see mass graves bodies without heads
and children dead night and fog is art
yes but it's also probably the most
harrowing and part hitting documentary
about the
greatest crime of the 20th century it is
amazing to see a work of art of such
power in such a short amount of time the
defining aspect of night and fog however
and the true source of its power is the
questions that it forces us to ask
ourselves why did this happen how did we
let it happen and why do we do it to one
another it is impossible to watch
without feeling immense sorrow not to
mention a sense of hopelessness for the
human race at large it's timeless
important and brilliant

It's 1945, the days of Japanese conquest in the 
Pacific are long over, and Allied forces are  
advancing in the entire theatre. For two years, US 
Admiral Chester Nimitz’s “island hopping” strategy  
has brought the Americans ever closer to 
Japan. Only those islands deemed strategically  
significant are being be seized, while all 
others are simply bypassed. In November 1943,  
the Americans take Tarawa, followed by 
the Marshall Islands in February 1944,  
and the Marianas in June. The costly landings 
at Peleliu in September 1944 show just how  
bloody such island battles could become.
Hi, I’m Jesse Alexander and welcome to a  
special episode on Real Time History 
– the Battle of Iwo Jima day-by-day. 
US commanders selected the tiny island of Iwo 
Jima as the next target. Only 7.2 kilometers long,  
and from 0.8 to 4 kilometers wide, it’s an 
insignificant speck in the vastness of the  
Pacific Ocean. But since it’s located halfway 
between Tokyo and US airbases in the Marianas,  
Iwo Jima could become a vital support base for 
B-29 bombers, escort fighters and search and  
rescue craft. Importantly, Iwo Jima is also part 
of the Tokyo Prefecture and is sovereign Japanese  
soil. The Americans hope its capture will deliver 
a severe psychological blow to the Japanese. 
The US Marines’ V Amphibious Corps, consisting 
of the 3rd, 4th and 5th Marine Divisions,  
is assigned the task of capturing the island, 
codenamed Operation Detachment. All told,  
100,000 men and 700 ships will partake in a 
battle the Americans expect to last 5 to 10 days. 
Defending Iwo Jima are the 21,000 Japanese 
troops of the 109th Infantry Division,  
commanded by Lt Gen KurIbayashi TadAmichi. 
KurIbayashi has studied the battle of Peleliu  
closely and instead of holding the Marines 
on the beach - or relying on costly banzai  
attacks - he plans to allow the Marines ashore 
and grind them down in attritional warfare on two  
main defensive belts. Each consists of hundreds 
of caves, tunnels and expertly hidden pillboxes  
which the Japanese are to hold to the end. 
Kuribayashi’s “Courageous Battle Vows”  
order each of his soldiers to kill 10 invaders.
D-Day (February 19th) 
The preparatory bombardment of Iwo Jima starts 3 
days before D-Day - February 19th. This is much  
less than the 10 days requested by V Amphibious 
Corps Commander Major-General Harry Schmidt. 
But as the first Marines move onto the 6 landing 
beaches at 9am, Japanese resistance seems light.  
The biggest obstacle is a 4.5-meter high terrace 
of volcanic ash which hinders the men and prevents  
their supporting LVTs from moving ashore. Just 
as bulldozers are brought in to make a path,  
Kuribayashi unleashes his artillery. It’s been 
pre-sighted to bracket the landing beaches, and  
pounds the Marines, inflicting heavy casualties. 
Now, Japanese machineguns open up from Mount  
SurIbachI, a semi-active volcano and the highest 
point in the island. But the heaviest Japanese  
fire of all comes from the Quarry on the extreme 
right of the landing beaches. Even before the  
invasion, 4th US Division commander Major 
General Clifton Cates had worried about it: 
“You know, if I knew the name of 
the man on the extreme right of  
the right-hand squad of the right-hand 
company of the right-hand battalion,  
I’d recommend him for a medal 
before we go in.” (Leckie 21) 
By 11am, bulldozers have cleared a path from 
the beaches, and the Marines begin to threaten  
Airfield No. 1. Meanwhile, the 28th Marine 
Regiment moves to cut off Mount Suribachi,  
creating a tenuous blockade (1). Colonel 
Harry Liversedge reports on conditions: 
“Troops ashore and moving to isolate volcano. 
Resistance moderate but terrain awful.” (Allen 25) 
By the early afternoon fighting dies down, but by 
the end of D-Day, only a third of the first day’s  
objectives have been taken.
D+1 (February 20th) 
The Marines capture Airfield No. 1, 
but elsewhere it’s becoming clear  
Japanese resistance is stiffening. In the east,  
Marines grind up against the Quarry, while 
the 28th moves around the base of Suribachi  
and its 70 reinforced concrete emplacements. 
Kuribayashi tries to stiffen his men’s resolve: 
“Each man should think of his defense position as 
his graveyard, fight until the last and inflict  
much damage to the enemy.” (Rottman 157)
D+2 (February 21st) 
February 21st, D+2, brings the Americans a 
new enemy - the weather. Rain and wind shut  
down the beaches, while kamikazes attack the 
US naval vessels offshore and sink an escort  
carrier. On the island, the bloody fighting 
continues. In the west, the flatter terrain  
allows for the use of tanks and the Americans 
make better progress (2), but against the Quarry  
US casualties mount (3). One company of 240 
Marines is reduced to just 18 men fit for duty. 
Around 5,300 Marines have been killed or wounded 
in the first three days, so the reserve, the 3rd  
Marines, is sent in ahead of schedule.
D+3 (February 22nd) 
Things did not improve as the rain turning 
Iwo Jima’s volcanic sand into a sticky goo  
that clung to boots and fouled 
weapons. The 28th Marines reports: 
“Bad weather and poor visibility throughout 
the day hampered our operations considerably.  
The rain mixed with volcanic dust 
caused stoppages in practically  
all automatic weapons, reducing 
them to single shot...” (Allen 68) 
Nonetheless, the Marines push ahead. 
The 28th now begins to scale Suribachi,  
while elsewhere the Marines attack 
Kuribayashi’s main defensive belt (4). 
Japanese Defences
Kurbayashi has turned Iwo Jima into  
a complex network of interconnected and mutually 
supporting hardpoints of all shapes and sizes.  
Some are simple snipers’ nests made from natural 
cracks in the rocks, while others are large  
reinforced blockhouses that seem impervious to 
even heavy artillery. The larger bunkers are  
well stocked with supplies and facilities. 
Japanese soldier Tsuuji Akikusa recalls: 
“The Southern Islands Naval Air Station 
Headquarters bunker… was the largest bunker  
on the island, and it was rumored that it would 
be able to hold out for about three months.  
There were about 800 people in the 
bunker. There were no fewer than  
500 drums filled with heavy oil, light oil, 
gasoline, and drinking water.” (Akikusa p. 41) 
With the aid of tunnels, Japanese soldiers can 
move around the battlefield undetected and launch  
their feared night attacks, which increase in 
frequency with each passing day. As a result,  
after dark American forces fire lamination 
shells to constantly bathe the island in light. 
D+4 February 23
The tunnels also allow the 800-man  
Japanese garrison at Suribachi to withdraw to the 
north just as the 28th begins its final assault  
on February 23rd. After meeting light resistance 
on the summit, Marines raised two US flags on the  
mountain to signal its capture - and in doing so 
they create one of the most iconic photographs  
of the 20th century.
D+5 February 24 
But the capture of Suribachi does not mean 
the US has won the battle. The next day,  
US forces assault Airfield No. 2, but Japanese 
mines and anti-tank guns prevent the use of  
tanks. So it’s up to American infantrymen armed 
with grenades, flamethrowers and small arms to  
lead the assault (5). The Japanese stubbornly hold 
on at the north end, and US troops are only able  
to make serious advances in the west (6). Although 
the 4th Marines clear the Quarry in the east, they  
now clash against the toughest enemy position yet.
D+6 February 25 
On D+6, the Marines in the east enter the 
‘Meatgrinder’, a complex of Japanese defences  
centred on three locations: Hill 382, Turkey 
Knob, and a low basin known as the Amphitheatre.  
Defenders in these positions can mutually 
support each other with machine guns,  
artillery and dug-in tanks. American progress 
slows, with advances measured in 100-yard  
dashes – which the men call “touchdowns.”
D+7 - D+8 February 26 - 27 
The 4th Marines continue to struggle with 
the Meatgrinder over the coming days,  
while the other divisions also come 
up against their own hardpoints.  
On February 27th, the Americans consolidate their 
gains (7), but progress northwards is still being  
measured in ‘touchdowns’. The Japanese 
are stubbornly defending their positions,  
which often hold until US armor assaults them 
from point blank range, sometimes with Zippo  
Sherman flame-throwing tanks. American 
tankers also ram or churn their treads  
over cave entrances to collapse them. Japanese 
soldier Okoshi Harunori recalls his fears: 
“Even if you pretended to die and fell over, 
on level ground American trucks and tanks  
would drive over you… Some of the soldiers 
hid in foxholes to avoid being run over,  
but when the American tanks found a 
foxhole, they would roll around on top of it  
and crush the people inside. If they got you like 
that you were doomed to gurgle until you died.”  
(Shuzaihan pp.132–3)
D+9 February 28 
On February 28th, which US command originally 
expected to be the last day of the battle,  
victory still seems a distant prospect. With 
the east becoming a stalemate, Schmidt orders  
the 3rd Division to push in the center towards the 
coast, to split the Japanese defenders’ last belt.  
With the aid of a massive artillery and air 
bombardment, the Marines surge forward and seize  
the remains of Airfield No. 2 (8).
D+10 March 1 
By the next day, American forces are threatening 
the unfinished Airfield No. 3, while in the west,  
the 5th Marines now clash against Nishi ridge 
(9), another prepared defensive position.  
In the east, Hill 382 is partially captured (10), 
but the Japanese on Turkey Knob and Amphitheater  
continue to hold out. As American 
casualties and exhaustion mount,  
more and more NCOs take command of Marine 
units - in some cases privates lead their  
units in assaults.
D+11 March 2 
But just as US forces are making progress in 
the east, the central drive bogs down. Japanese  
defenders on Hills 362B (11) and C(12) are holding 
up the Marines, with the summits heavily contested  
in brutal hand-to-hand fighting.
D+12 March 3 
By the following day, D+12, a stalemate sets in. 
Marine casualties have been extremely high so far:  
3,000 dead and 13,000 wounded. The 
Japanese have lost 14,000, almost all dead,  
and only have about 7000 men left. In the west 
the Americans capture Nishi and Hill 362A (13)  
and fully surround the Amphitheater (14). 
As the battle continues, the Marines also  
begin to note deceptive Japanese tactics:
“[Japanese] Snipers dressed in Marine uniforms  
and armed with M-1’s [sic] were encountered, 
also, it was discovered that the enemy was  
booby-trapping their dead.” (Allen 153)
D+13 - 14 March 4-5 
In anticipation of future offensives, Schmidt 
now orders two days of rest except for smaller  
attacks to straighten the line. Fresh American 
replacements arrive, but many of them have no  
combat experience. Airfield No. 1 sees some 
unusual activity today as damaged B-29 bomber  
Dinah Might makes an emergency landing.
D +15 March 6 
The next day's American attack is preceded 
by a massive artillery bombardment – the guns  
fire over 22,500 shells in the first hour alone. 
However, their impact and the advance in general  
is disappointing from the US point 
of view. Fierce Japanese resistance  
limits the Marines to advances of only 50 
to 100 metres across the whole island (15). 
D +16 March 7
It’s become clear the Japanese are now well versed  
in the method and schedule of Marine attacks 
– an artillery barrage followed by infantry  
assault. So 3rd Divison’s General Graves Erskine 
suggests a dawn attack at 5am without artillery.  
Graves’ troops won’t advance straight ahead as 
previously, but into a Japanese sector facing  
the neighboring 4th Division. The Americans 
try the new method for the first time on March  
7 – and it seems to work, as by the end of the day 
they take Hill 362C (16). This advance started to  
create a pocket of Japanese resistance known as 
Cushman’s Pocket which continues to hold out. 
At midnight of the same day, senior Japanese 
commander Captain Inouye Samaji ignores  
Kuribayashi’s orders and leads a 1,500-man banzai 
attack from around Tachiiwa Point (17). He hopes  
to pierce the US lines, destroy equipment, and 
even scale Suribachi to raise the Japanese flag.  
But the Marines’ fire decimates his 
men, some of whom are only armed with  
bamboo spears or explosive vests, from 
range. The Americans suffer few losses. 
D +17 - +19 March 8 - 10
The wasteful banzai charge  
marks the end of major resistance in the east. 
Over the next three days, the marines bypass  
Japanese hardpoints in Cushman’s Pocket (18) and 
finally reduce the Meatgrinder (19). In the north,  
a US patrol reaches the sea before the Japanese 
push it back (20). Kuribayashi knows the battle  
is coming to a close, but he radios to Tokyo 
that he has no intention of surrendering: 
“All surviving fighting units have sustained heavy 
losses. I am very sorry that I have let the enemy  
occupy one part of Japanese territory but am 
taking comfort in giving him heavy damages.”  
(Allen 161)
FD +20 - March 11 
On D+20, Japanese resistance only exists in 
three isolated pockets: Cushman’s Pocket,  
the eastern coast, and part of the northwest 
coast. Kuribayashi now falls back to a gorge,  
later dubbed Bloody Gorge, with his last 1,500 
men (21). The Marines are exhausted and many  
are incapacitated by a psychological condition 
they call combat fatigue, today known as PTSD.  
So they call on the Japanese to surrender, and 
announce on loudspeakers that prisoners will be  
treated well and suicidal resistance is senseless. 
The Americans also distribute a translated letter  
from Japanese prisoner of war Momoda Hideo:
“Comrades, I myself would never have believed  
that things could be this way if I hadn’t seen it 
with my own eyes. At first I was embarrassed to  
have been taken by the enemy, but when I learned 
that several officers… had the same experience  
I felt better. In our conversations we agreed that 
it is more honorable to live for the Emperor and  
work for a greater Japan in the future than merely 
to die like rats underground.” (Sandberg 114) 
Messages like that one, though, have little 
impact. The Americans continue to advance and  
eliminate all Japanese strongpoints except for 
Bloody Gorge. Although US authorities declare  
Iwo Jima secure on March 14 Kuribayashi 
continues to hold out for 9 more days in a  
seemingly impregnable blockhouse. US artillery 
couldn’t be used for fear of friendly fire,  
so marines armed with flamethrowers, 
grenades, and demolition explosives  
take on the job of reducing it.
On March 23rd,  
Kuribayashi issued his final communication to 
the Japanese garrison on nearby Chichi Jima: 
“All officers and men of Chichi 
Jima, good-bye from Iwo.” (Allen 217) 
Kuribayashi’s ultimate fate is not known. 
It’s possible that he commits suicide,  
or that he dies in one of the banzai attacks that 
become more common in the final days. On March 26,  
around 200-300 Japanese troops sneak out of 
the Bloody Gorge and strike at Airfield No. 2,  
attacking mostly airmen and construction 
personnel. This charge, which US troops  
quickly destroy, signals the end of the battle.
It’s now D+35. Marine casualties are around  
23,000, including 6,800 dead, while the 
navy loses about 2800 dead and wounded.  
19,000 of the 21,000 Japanese troops on the island 
are killed. Only 216 surrender during the battle,  
and up to 2000 continue to struggle in small 
groups until they are mopped up by US troops. 
Although the later battle of Okinawa will 
prove even costlier for the Americans,  
Iwo Jima is still the deadliest single 
battle for the Marines, and the only battle  
in the US Pacific Campaign where American 
casualties outnumber those of the Japanese. 
Iwo Jima is also a battle with a controversial 
legacy. The US Army and Navy will later claim  
the operation was of little use, especially 
for the price paid. But for its intended  
practical purposes it does provide immediate 
benefits. Through the last months of the war,  
2,251 B-29s make emergency landings on Iwo, 
potentially saving the lives of 24,000 US airmen.

phobias are a fascinating part of the
psyche
some are completely understandable and
possibly even
evolutionary as being scared of
dangerous things and creatures
is pretty beneficial for survival but a
question
has eluded psychologists how are phobias
present in some people
but not others and can you condition a
fear
in a human test subject this question
would lead psychologist john b
watson and his assistant graduate
student rosaline
rayner down a very ethically
questionable path
not only was experimenting on a human
controversial but the test subject
would be a nine-month-old baby today
we're looking at the controversial
heartbreaking and morally questionable
baby albert experiments
welcome to the dark side of science
nothing about the statement
experimenting on a nine-month-old baby
sounds good and the idea to deliberately
scare an infant is very off-putting
the experiment is even more
controversial than the monkey mother
studies
as long-term effects could be scarring
for an otherwise healthy human child
as such i'm going to rate the experiment
here eight on my ethical scale
as a subject had no say in becoming part
of the study and to the alleged sourcing
of the child
was not shall we say the most
praiseworthy way
but before we get to baby albert we need
a little background to the person behind
the experiment
john b watson john broadus watson was
born
in travellers rest south carolina on the
9th of
january 1878. he was brought up in a
strict christian family
but things would change in a teenager's
home life when his
alcoholic father left the family this
would cause jon to become
apathetic towards religion the family
later moved to greenville south carolina
where watson would get a chance to meet
people of different backgrounds
igniting his interest into psychology
his secondary education was marred with
run-ins with the law
for fighting and bizarrely discharging a
firearm within city limits
however he was still able to gain a
place at greenville's furman university
at the age of 16. his time at university
was difficult
having to work several jobs he didn't
excel
and did not create many social bonds
which left people to think of him
as lazy and anti-social but he persisted
and at the age of 21 gained a master's
degree he managed to get into chicago
university a couple of years later
and finally his career started to take a
more positive turn
studying under some notable professors
including john dewey
and james roland angel watson began to
develop an interest in behaviouralism
during his time at chicago he read up on
the work of ivan pavlov known for his
classic conditioning
a discipline which would directly
influence watson's later experiments
as a side note this is the same pavlov
with the dribbling dog
i should say that during this time
watson had got married
and was the father of two children but
his marriage would break down
but this will come a bit later on in our
story in 1902
watson gained his phd whilst working as
a research professor
at the university of chicago in 1908
watson accepted a faculty position at
john hopkins university
being promoted to chair of the
psychology department
not long after starting he continued to
study behaviouralism
releasing a paper in 1913 named
psychology as the behaviouralist views
it a manifesto of sorts laying out the
goals of the new discipline
behaviouralism as watson saw it sought
to understand behavior
by only measuring observable behaviors
and events
and that these actions were influenced
from
external stimuli as a consequence of
that
individual's history and learned
behavior from reinforcement
or punishment this new form of
psychological study wasn't initially
accepted by the wider scientific
community
but gradually the new discipline would
make inroads to be a recognized field
the discipline would be expanded upon by
scientists like b.f skinner
aka the guy who made a pigeon guided
bomb
which i made a video about a long time
ago
check it out if you want to see a even
worse produced playing difficult video
in 1915 watson served as the president
of the american psychological
association
watson would continue to produce papers
expanding on his views into behaviourism
which would reject the study of
consciousness with
his important later career 1924 book
behaviouralism but before that we need
to look at a couple of very turbulent
years for watson
which brought about the baby albert
experiment
in 1919 watson released a paper called a
schematic outline of the emotions
during this study he observed a number
of infants which revealed
three fundamental emotions fear rage and
love
each caused by a set of conditions
watson used various animals to observe
the reaction from
the test subjects in most cases
especially when introduced to dogs and
cats
the infant showed a neutral or an
inquisitive reaction
but when introduced to a pigeon flapping
its wings
most subjects showed surprise or even
fear of the motion and sound
to induce fear some of the test subjects
were placed in a dark room
or in a room on their own needless to
say
the children became distressed now these
tests are pretty mild and generally
yielded predictable results
but what if you can get an infant to
fear something
that had initially yielded a neutral
response
for example one of the cuddly animals
from his 1919 study
this will be done by introducing a
neutral stimulus
like a rabbit with a scary stimulus for
example from a loud banging sound
they tried to answer the following
questions that if a fear stimulus
could be transferred to other animals or
other inanimate objects once a fear of
being conditioned
in a test subject they also went to find
out for how long
right this is where the study in my
opinion crosses the line
as a sourcing of the test subject and
finding a parent willing to allow their
child to be given a phobia
would be understandably difficult baby
albert
was a child of a wet nurse at the
harriet lane home
a pediatric facility on the john hopkins
campus
now it's not 100 known how albert was
found
clearly a major contributory factor was
the convenience as harriet lane was
adjacent to the phipps clinic where
watson's infant laboratory was housed
there are three possible ways watson got
hold of albert that have been considered
the first is for a paid study the second
is by using his connections at the
hospital
to coerce and allow access to the infant
and the final
is from doing the experiment without the
mother's knowledge
but we will never know a hundred percent
how albert was found by watson
and we don't even know if that is his
real name
what we do know is that he was selected
due to being healthy
unemotional child who rarely cried the
experiment wasn't just conducted by
watson alone
but also one of his graduate students
rosaline rayner i should say that his
relationship with her
had caused issues with his breaking down
marriage by late 1919. at the start of
1920
and at 8 months and 26 days of age baby
albert was entered into the study
albert was observed reacting to a number
of live animals
for example a rat a dog a rabbit and a
monkey
and various inanimate objects including
human masks
cotton and a burning newspaper
during the initial phase albert showed
no elevated signs of distress
or major reaction to the stimuli what
watson
and rosaline did see was elevated
distress
when a metal bar was hit with a hammer
which created a large amount of noise
sending little albert into a burst of
tears
two months would go by after albert's
baseline observations before the
experimental conditioning would begin
watson and rayner attempted to condition
him to fear one of the items that had
previously garnered a neutral response
a white rat was chosen to be an item to
condition albert's fear
response this was done by presenting the
animal to the infant
and every time he touched it the metal
pole was hit with the hammer creating
the scary noise
it wouldn't take long for albert to
start to fear the cuddly animal
after seven pairings of the rat and the
noise in two sessions
one week apart albert reacted with
crying when the rat was presented
subsequently
with no loud noise although he didn't
seem as distressed when he was allowed
to suck his thumb
which hints at a phobia not actually
being created
a couple of weeks after the conditioning
albert started to fear
other similar items that shared similar
characteristics with the rats
the generalized fear manifested whenever
the family dog
a fur coat some cotton wool and even a
father christmas mask was presented to
the infant
a couple of weeks after that albert's
fear of the rat had died down
including the response to the other
similar items
this prompted watson to recondition the
infant by presenting the rat again with
the loud noise
each reconditioning would only take a
few rounds of the scary noises
but what of the questions set out by the
pair before the experiment
how long does the condition last 31 days
after no exposure to the test items
albert was shown a rat a coat and santa
mask
he again showed a fear response not long
after the final experiment
albert's mother withdrew her child from
the study and left the hospital for good
leaving little trace of what happened to
the test subject this had two downsides
the first was that albert was unable to
be reconditioned to not fear the rat and
the linked fear-producing things
and the other issue was that the study
was incomplete
right well taking into account that the
experiment happened over a hundred years
ago
we do have to look at it in the context
of the time when experimental psychology
was in its infant hood and the study was
even one of the first to be filmed at a
great cost to the university
by today's standards the experiment was
morally ethically and even
scientifically on shaky ground
the first two reasons are pretty obvious
as well experimenting on children is
just wrong
at least in my eyes but the scientific
failures
are very important to consider the study
did not have a control subject
involving only one infant which makes
the data
hard to properly interpret as one result
does not make a conclusion it's almost
impossible to know longer term effects
on baby albert
as we may never know if the phobias if
any created
during the experiment were long lasting
we will never know for sure what
happened to albert
or even if it was his real identity
researchers into the experiment
have a couple of potential identities
with one dying at the age of six
and another living until 2007 but we
will never know for sure
some doubts present as to whether or not
the condition fear response was actually
a phobia
this was due to a reduced response when
the infant was allowed to suck his thumb
which almost made him be able to ignore
the loud sound
the experiment was responsible in part
for destroying watson's working career
but not how you might think what came
out later in 1920
was that the psychologist was having an
affair with his assistant rosalind
rayner
the scandal would result in watson's
dismissal from his job
at john hopkins university the affair
became front-page news during the
divorce proceedings in the baltimore
newspapers
destroying the psychologist's reputation
and with it his university career
not that that was the complete end for
him as he released his behaviouralism
book in 1924
and also psychological care of infant
and child in 1928
he would have another two children and
would work for an advertising company
from late 1920 he would raise both
children
to his and roslyn's behaviourist
principles
and sadly both sons would attempt
suicide with one of them being
successful in 1954.
reyna died on the 18th of june 1935
in norwood hospital in connecticut she
had unexpectedly contracted dysentery
from eating tainted fruit watson would
never remarry
and pass away himself in 1958 at the age
of 80.

[Music]
it is an Autumn morning 105 BC from his
Camp positioned near the rone river
Roman Commander quintus cilius Kio
waited in anticipation for the looming
battle an enormous Roman army numbering
over 100,000 including camp followers
faced a tribal Force led by the kimry
king BoRics and Tuton King tabot then
their Warriors presented an overwhelming
challenge numbering over
200,000 as the Romans faced the imminent
Clash a Discord had already emerged
among their ranks capio and Consul nius
malus Maximus driven by personal
ambition found themselves at odds
despite malus's plea for cooperation
Capo's refusal resulted in disjointed
Roman forces as time progressed more and
more kiman Warriors surrounded the Roman
camps as the battle became inevitable
the repercussions of the fractured Roman
command unfolded with capio hoping for
malus's support in the face of the
impending kiman
assault in the 2 Century BC the European
continent bore witness to a tapestry of
tribes and cultures at the heart of it
all stood Rome the emerging Juggernaut
of antiquity but beyond the reach of
Roman dominance in the shadowed corners
of this ancient continent lay a
multitude of tribes each with their own
stories customs and aspirations amidst
this Patchwork of peoples one name
stirred both curiosity and alarm the
kimry hailing from the distant reaches
of Northern Jutland in the late 2
Century BC they embarked on a migration
that sent ripples of unease through
Europe's tribal Landscapes they were but
one of many tribes indiscriminately
raiding any others they came across the
sby Tuton semon marom mani and Bo to
name just a few the kimry led by their
King BoRics continued their Trek through
Europe together with Jans and ambron
they engaged in conflict with the Boi
and other Celtic tribes the first
inklings of their migration were sounded
by Rome's treaty bound allies the toishi
who raised the alarm about the Kim's
impending arrival it was the year 113 BC
when Roman consul kaai papirus carabo
decided to defend their allies and
confront the kimry his chosen
Battleground was Norah located in the
heart of Austria however the Roman
consul's ambition exceeded his military
prowess and he suffered a resounding
defeat at the hands of the kimry the
kimry not content with their victory
over Caro continued their migration
leaving Rome in a state of
apprehension instead of turning to the
Italian Peninsula they turned West into
Galia
naanis together with the tutun they
continued their migration disrupting the
balance of power and engaging in clashes
with other tribes and Roman allies
amidst these threats Rome faced another
challenge across the Mediterranean Sea
emerging tensions in numidia exacerbated
by King jura's betrayal led to war from
107 BC One of Rome's most promising
commanders gas I replaced Rome's
commander in numidia to wage war against
the unruly King the simultaneous
management of these two Wars tested
Roman military prowess in 107 BC as the
war in numidia lingered on the Roman
senate organized another campaign
against the kimry a 40,000 strong Army
led by the consul Lucius Casio longinus
defeated a Germanic Celtic Alliance near
tosa however at Bala an enormous Army
consisting of kimry two tones and tigari
defeated the Roman army killing the
consul and the high ranking officers
news of the defeat enraged Rome but it
also endangered the city other GIC
tribes often subjugated by the Romans
saw a chance and Rose up in Rebellion
the following year Rome's new consuls
quintus cilius capio and gas atius sanus
began preparing their retribution capio
was assigned Gul as a province and
embarked on a mission to reassert Roman
authority over rebellious allies in the
course of his campaign he recaptured
toosa where he amassed a staggering
treasure believed by some to have
originated from the famed Temple of Deli
however the focus on the Treasure's
theft obscures much of the campaign's
details there is a dir of information
regarding the local tribes activities
during this time the kimry after their
earlier Victory against Rome seemed to
change their Cor
moving away from Southern Gaul and
refraining from advancing towards Italy
despite a prior inclination to settle in
those
territories frustration and Desperation
may have set in for the kimry as they
had not yet found a peaceful settlement
after 7 years of conflict while
understanding they could not settle in
Italy they likely believed they could
not settle in southern Gall or Spain
until Roman influence north of the Alps
was removed but in the Kim's absence
Rome dispatched reinforcements to the
region to prevent marauding tribes from
endangering their Capital they had two
armies in G one led by Pro Consul capio
and the other by the new Consul malus
who were assigned different provinces
along the ran River as per Roman
tradition despite being on the same side
Kio and malus were known for being
Fierce Rivals often unwilling to
cooperate or help each other out the
events leading up to arosio are not well
documented but it appears that in early
105 BC King boric and the kimri
accompanied by the tones and their King
tabot returned to Southern Gore they ran
into fresh Roman armies controlling and
pacifying the region these Romans aimed
to eradicate the tribal threat once and
for
all Roman strength numbered around
120,000 in total 880,000 of these were
troops divided into 10 to 12 Legions
Additionally the Romans marshaled 40,000
auxiliaries and camp followers the Roman
armies faced an overwhelming tribal
force that could have reached as many as
300,000 Warriors According to some
accounts this enormous Force included
the kimry tutonis torini and ambones
they were commanded by the kimry king
boric and tutan King tbod before the
Battle of arosio there was an initial
encounter between the Romans and the
kimri during which a Roman Force Under
the command of Aurelius scorus serving
as a legot under malus faced the kimry
heavily outnumbered scores' forces were
ambushed and defeated some of his troops
fled but most were captured or killed
scorus was captured and brought before
boric he refused to lead the kimry
across the Alps considering the language
barrier it remains unclear how the
Romans eventually learned this story but
it appears scorus demanded the kimry
turn back he dissuaded them from
crossing the Alps and invading Italy his
Defiance was not appreciated and King
boric had him executed meanwhile near
the rone river malas and capio set up
their respective camps near the river
banks both commanders were driven by
personal ambition and a desire to claim
individual Glory the closest settlement
was the town of arosio Consul malus
recognizing the looming threat sent a
letter to Kyo urging him to combine
their forces to confront the kimry
however Kyo refused to cooperate kyo's
refusal to cooperate with malas resulted
in the Roman forces operating as
separate armies rather than a unified
front before the battle the kimry had
sent emissaries to the Romans perhaps
driven by dread or a desire for land for
their tribe to settle on however any
cooperation or acceptance of the Kim's
terms would have been highly unlikely
kio's subsequent Brusque dismissal of
the envoys angered the kimry and Kings
boric and tbod committed to an attack as
the battle became inevitable it remains
unclear precisely how the failure to
cooperate between the Roman commanders
affected the battle itself Capo's Army
closer to the kimry bore the initial
brunt of the battle as the kimry
attacked Roman historians allude that
kaipio launched a Counterattack with
hopes that m IAS would offer support
Roman legionaries and kiman warriors
engaged in a brutal melee The Clash was
chaotic and Close Quarters with
disciplined Roman cohorts facing the
Relentless attacks of the kimry the
battlefield echoed with the sounds of
weapons clashing and warriors grappling
as both sides fought fiercely for
control in the intense hand-to-hand
combat however kio's attack ultimately
failed leading to his retreat
with kio's Camp exposed the kimry
plundered and ransacked his Camp some
legionaries attempted to defend the camp
but the kimry mercilessly slaughtered
camp followers and troops alike some
surviving Romans likely retreated into
malus's Army though unsure if the armies
collided and became intertwined this may
have only increased chaos among the
Roman ranks hungry for victory after
such an effortless Triumph the kimry
surged forward to assault maximus' camp
internal Discord had already pushed the
Roman contingent to the brink according
to Roman historians their camps were
close together and most troops witnessed
the utter annihilation of comrades this
led to even more crumbling of morale as
the kimry came closer and launched
attacks against the Roman Camp many
legionaries stood firm attempting to
defend but the overwhelming number of
Warriors quickly proved too much for
them under different circumstances a
retreat might have ensued but the poorly
positioned Camp left them cornered
against the river the river ran acting
as a natural barrier left the Romans
trapped and vulnerable although many
attempted a river Escape armor Laden
difficulties thwarted their efforts only
a few including servants and camp
followers successfully Slipped Away the
battle itself resulted in a catastrophic
loss for the Romans according to
rutilius Rufus the casualties were
staggering with at least 70,000 regular
troops and light armed soldiers
perishing in a single day casualty
figures in other ancient accounts vary
from 60,000 to 80,000 Roman and Allied
troops lost Livy references valerus
antias for example he asserts the Romans
lost an estimated 880,000 soldiers and
40,000 servants and camp followers this
defeat at arosio stood as one of Rome's
most significant and devastating
military setbacks paralleling the
magnitude of the Battle of canai in
terms of losses despite the lack of a
detailed account of the battle its
impact on Roman history remains profound
showcasing the severe consequences of
divided leadership and Military
mismanagement only 10 men are said to
have survived the devastating defeat in
the aftermath the kimry having gained
control of Roman caps and a substantial
amount of plunder engaged in a
destructive frenzy they systematically
destroyed captured clothing discarded
gold and silver into the river hacked
apart breastplates ruined horse
trappings drowned horses and hanged men
from
trees however the critical Factor
contributing to the Roman defeat lay not
only in the numerical disadvantage but
also in the lack of coordination between
the two Roman
commanders this fatal combination of
personal ambition and overconfidence in
Roman military invincibility proved
disastrous many details remain
relatively unknown due to the lack of
surviving narratives covering the
battle the aftermath of the devastating
battle brought widespread grief to Italy
in this Grim atmosphere the Romans
believed that an invasion by the Gauls
such as the kimry was imminent they
feared a repeat of the gala saac of Rome
which still loomed as a spectre in
Collective Roman
history in 387 BC at the river Alia a
Gaul Coalition defeated the Romans
before sacking the capital city however
into this troubled backdrop arrived news
of gas marius's success in capturing
juga and ending the jorine war Marius
was elected consul for 104 BC and
subsequently reelected four more times
ushering in the age of Marius and
positioning him as a central figure in
the upcoming kiman

we're talking
interview styles this is gonna be a
classic educational video we're going
through
all the interview styles in documentary
filmmaking so let's get into it
the first style i'm just to call
standard this is when you have someone
sitting looking just off to the side of
camera this is where you put your
interviewer as close to the lens as
possible that's my suggestion because
the eye line look i'm looking just off
to the camera you can already tell that
i'm not looking at the camera i'm
looking at the camera looking off the
camera looking at the camera off camera
so don't put someone over there because
now you're getting a lot of the face you
want to see both eyes that's how we
connect with people but a standard
interview is the safest way to approach
documentaries it's been kind of the more
traditional way it's often how i do my
films and the way to make it a bit more
juicy is i like to use a floating camera
to the side where i get that side angle
the camera's moving i can go from their
hands to their face shallow depth of
field it feels a bit more cinematic i
would say to use a very overused term
but i like shooting from that side and
the key with these interviews is always
have the person looking towards the
light wherever your key light is make
sure they're looking to that side
because then you'll have the shadow side
on the opposite and that's where you'll
put your b camera or if you have them
looking off this way they're going to be
looking into the shadows and it's not as
nice when people have full shadow on
their face rather than looking into that
beautiful light the pros of this style
is that it's very safe and easy to do
the con it's just that it's very safe
it's probably the least creative
approach but that's okay because it
works and sometimes though it can feel a
bit distant if you just have a side
angle this person staring off into space
you don't always feel connected whereas
if you do the enterotron that's number
two which is coined from an amazing
documentary filmmaker errol morris
that's where you're looking down the
barrel of the lens why it's called in
teratron is he would use this kind of
video display two-way mirror glass
similar to a teleprompter and he would
display his face over the camera lens
and it would be two-way glass so you
wouldn't see it on the image but he
would be talking to the person looking
right down the barrel there's cheaper
systems of this that just use mirrors
but the great part about that is what's
happening right now in this is i'm
connecting with you i'm looking into
your eyes and you're looking at me and
you're beautiful in every single way
don't let anyone ever tell you that but
we get to have a connection even though
i'm just staring into a deep dark black
hole of the camera lens and where the
enterotron style excels is that it's
more
intimate it creates a better connection
with the audience in my opinion than
other styles because you're looking
directly at them now the con of it is
that it does require some technology one
benefit of it is in my cnn film is they
interrotroned me into the interview i
was in canada and rod here was down in
la and we were talking together i was
just over zoom and he could see my face
on the zoom screen and it felt like we
had a conversation so it is a cool style
it's sometimes overused but you do see
in a lot of documentaries these days and
so it's a great way to try out and one
little thing is if you have someone
who's a bit more confident you don't
necessarily need the entertron you can
just ask them to look directly into lens
when they talk but usually looking into
a lens is a bit intimidating
the next interview style is
conversational this is where you get two
people talking about a topic and you
shoot it kind of like a traditional
scripted film the difficulty of this is
you're often gonna need two cameras to
cross shoot or you're gonna be good at
getting what we call the counter shot
this is the person listening you can see
the scene from battleground i did this
on my own it's very intimate and it
feels like something happening in real
time but what i had to do at the end is
i had to go back over and just ask quasi
to nod and listen which can get awkward
at times but man it's such a natural
style of interview and you can prompt
the people to talk about certain
subjects but what's great is they make
it their own this is truly one of my
favorite styles of documentary
interviews because it feels the most
natural conversational when pulled off
authentically can be one of the more
powerful interview styles in a
documentary and in our course they're
out of documentary we break down a ton
of different scenes from our
feature-length documentaries where we do
conversational style mike really
implements this quite amazing in his
films he'll break down full scenes in
his award-winning documentaries of how
he shoots conversation interviews on his
own to make it look like there's two
cameras and he does an amazing job of
prompting them in a way that never feels
like there's a director so it feels like
you're just a fly on the wall and if
you're interested in art of documentary
we're opening the doors september 12th
you always hear me talking about this
this is launch season and i have to talk
about it because you'll miss out we
don't open the doors again until march
of next year and what is art of
documentary well it's our course in
academy it's a huge community of over 2
500 filmmakers who are making amazing
films right now we get to encourage each
other we do monthly zoom calls we have
over 140 videos between our three
modules which go into how to tell
stories how to find documentaries how to
never get stuck in your edit how to
increase your business as a filmmaker so
you can go shoot these documentaries
these passion projects everything you've
ever needed to know about filmmaking not
just the gear and technical not just how
to use luts or transitions but how to
actually tell a story doesn't matter
what camera you have in your hand or
what technical knowledge you have if you
don't know how to tell a good story and
that's where art of documentary comes in
to help you complete the films that are
on your heart and that you know you're
meant to make the world needs your voice
and you don't have to make those films
on your own so come be a part of the art
of documentary doors open september 12th
we'll have 30 off but let's get back to
the tutorial i just get excited about
aod
so our fourth interview style i call
this the host plus standard this is
where you have that standard interview
where someone's looking just off camera
but instead of looking into the void we
actually get to see what they're looking
at which is a reverse angle of a host
this is typical of news journalist films
you'll sometimes see people like michael
moore implement this into their films
you get to see the conversations that's
happening but the way the filmmakers
approach this is they're not avoiding
the fact that it's actually a sit-down
interview it's two people in a very
traditional sense sitting in chairs well
lit talking this best works like i
mentioned for journalist pieces or films
where you've decided to put yourself in
the movie to be honest it's not my
favorite style but it is effective if
you're doing a journalist style
documentary but there's another version
with a host called host plus
conversation and again i've just coined
all these terms there might be other
terms you can leave them below this is
that anthony bourdain style this is
where we're not just watching a
conversation but we're aware there's a
host and they're prompting the person
with questions but we get to watch them
conduct that interview in a very casual
sense so it's a conversation but the
host is there to help guide it along the
downfalls of this is that again it can
get boring at times if we're just
watching someone try to ask questions
that may not be working but the engaging
part of this is that it's fun you get to
do it wherever you want you can do it in
a car you could do it walking in a field
there's many different ways to approach
the host plus conversation style and if
you again are in your own film if you've
put yourself in this film or you're
following a host it's a great way to
keep it natural and it doesn't feel so
stagnant the next style i want to talk
about is what i call in the moment this
is where we're seeing two people walking
it's a bit similar to host plus standard
but something is happening on camera
again it's like watching a conversation
except for watching two people
do something and you're grabbing bits of
the interview that way you sometimes see
tv shows do this where they'll have them
doing a task they'll do like basket
weaving or something i don't know if we
can even find b-roll of that
but this gets away from the host
conversation style and again begins to
feel more authentic because it doesn't
actually feel like an interview feels
like more of an organic natural
conversation and the last interview
style is just standard voiceover this is
where you don't have the person on
camera but i would always encourage you
if you can shoot that interview because
you never know when you need to cut to
it but films like killer be killed or my
latest film about tornadoes
i mostly rely on voice over in those
films but i still shoot the interviews
for that one or two moments where i do
cut to them you'll watch killer be
killed we filmed that entire interview
and joel narrates the entire film but we
only cut to it like twice and that's
where i would rather show engaging
b-roll that embodies what he's saying
than just sitting there watching someone
talk but i think voiceover is a great
way for you as a filmmaker to push
yourself to push yourself to shoot more
real-time scenes and to show more of
life rather than having someone just sit
there and tell you about life showing is
way more interesting than telling and i
would encourage you if you're making
your films don't just settle for someone
talking and then cutting to random
b-roll if you're gonna have b-roll make
it connect to what they're talking and
if you don't have to show them talking
show some engaging b-roll or better yet
show a scene
so there you go i hope that helped
shooting interviews is one of my
favorite parts of documentary you don't
have to be scared about it if you're
nervous on how to do that we have tons
of information on this youtube channel
better yet check out our documentary
because we have tons of videos on how to

the iberian peninsula is home to the
lands of five countries
andorra and france in the north portugal
in the west with spain dominating the
rest
well most of the rest since country
number five which sits in this tiny area
in the south
is the united kingdom this territory is
called gibraltar and despite numerous
wars between the united kingdom and
spain britain still holds the territory
which raises the obvious question why
why does britain own gibraltar
so the first part of this question is
how did britain get a hold of gibraltar
in the first place
well the answer to that is simple in the
year 1700 the king of spain
died now normally a king dying wouldn't
be a problem but this king charles ii
didn't have any kids which of course
meant succession crisis
charles chose philippe of the house of
bourbon and grandson of louis xiv for
france to succeed him
this upset mostly everyone since it
played spain and its gargantuan empire
firmly in the french sphere of influence
and so of course
war everyone united against spain and
france and in 1704
english and dutch soldiers landed in
gibraltar and seized it to keep the
mouth of the mediterranean open
in 1713 in return for britain leaving
the war immediately spain opted to see
gibraltar to them forever
gibraltar's original population had
largely fled during the war and it was
stationed by british troops and from
then on acted as an important naval base
whose population grew thereafter
so britain now owned gibraltar but what
stopped spain from regaining it
it was a tiny stretch of land attached
to the spanish mainland so surely it
would have been simple to walk in and
take it
well turns out no it wasn't long until
spain and britain were back at war again
and despite laying siege to gibraltar a
further two times over the next 75 years
it always held out the largest siege
came during the american war for
independence when britain's attention
was focused on those rascals
spain with the help of the french laid
siege to gibraltar for four years hoping
to starve the people out
however the british were able to
resupply gibraltar due to the size of
their navy in spain's issues maintaining
its own
as you'll know britain lost the war as a
whole and so when both sides sat down to
negotiate why didn't spain use the
opportunity
to regain gibraltar one britain hadn't
been conquered or crushed and could
still fight meaning spain couldn't get
everything it wanted and two
it had more important land to regain
notably florida and also menorca both of
which it got
when all of that was over in 1783 spain
never made another military attempt to
retake the rock
so that's it all settled then right well
no the spanish government always
maintained a claim to gibraltar much of
which was down to its geographic
positioning at the mouth of the
mediterranean and also because its
continued loss was seen as a blight on
spain's national honour for the next
century and a half though very little
change with respect to gibraltar
that was until 1936 when the spanish
civil war broke out
the border was closed mostly because of
there being too many refugees trying to
flee spain and britain further built up
gibraltar's defenses this caused
disputes with spanish leadership since
previously there had been an agreed
neutral zone between the two areas
however spain wasn't looking and so
britain quickly built up an airfield
there which became useful when world war
ii broke out
now spain's new leader francisco franco
was clear that he wanted gibraltar back
however when he was offered the chance
to get it back by joining the axis in
world war ii with germany he declined
franco said no because the positives
didn't outweigh the negatives and also
his country was in ruins
in the post-war world there was a big
drive towards decolonization and
gibraltar was firmly in the crosshairs
of this movement
a referendum was held in gibralta to
determine whether the people wished to
be a part of spain or remain in overseas
territory of the united kingdom
and the results were extremely close
with over 99
of people opting to remain under the
control of the united kingdom
when franco caught a mild case of death
and his regime came to an end relations
between britain and spain improved and
after a series of negotiations the
border reopened
and despite the continuing dispute over
the status of gibraltar there would be
no further changes in its status and to
this day it remains a british overseas
territory

after I came back I asked myself why
Messiah the chief of Special Ops
selected to travel to the South Pole at
that time to do a job that any number of
others could have been and I wondered if
it could have been because of one of my
routine duties if I had been in
Washington would have been to arrange
for additional security in Texas so I
decided to check it out and sure enough
I found out that someone had told them
112 military intelligence group in 4th
army headquarters at Fort Sam Houston to
stand down that day over the protests of
the unit commander Colonel why I believe
it's mysterious is significant because
it is standard operating procedure
especially in a knowing los talas it
even down to something of the Secret
Service but even if we had not allowed
the double-talk to be removed from the
limousine we would have placed at least
100 to 200 agents on the sidewalk
without question when only a UN
Ambassador Adlai Stevenson stood on him
it already been several attempts under
gauls life in France we would have
arrived days ahead of time to study the
route checked all the dirt
wide open empty windows overlooking
daily never we'd have had our own Smith
was covering the area the minitor
Wendell it up they'd have been on the
radio we've been watching the crowd and
he just rolled up newspaper Oscoda where
I never would have let a man
along the way never would have allowed
that limousine to slow too
much less take that unusual curve at
Houston at helm you would have felt an
army presence in the streets that none
of this happened it was a violation of
the most basic protection codes we have
and it is the best indication of a
massive clot in Dallas who could have
best done this black ox mr. garrison
people in my business people like my
superior officer could have called
Colonel Reich and said look we have
another unit coming from so-and-so
providing security you'll stand down I
mean that day in fact there were some
individual army intelligence people in
Dallas and still trying to figure out
who would want but they weren't
protecting a client and of course Osberg
army Intel had a Harvey Lee Oswald on
file
all's house a destroyed many strange
things were happening in here Lee Harvey
Oswald had nothing to do with them we
had the entire cabinet on a trip to the
Far East we had 1/3 of a combat division
returning from Germany in the air above
the United States at the time of the
shooting at 12:34 p.m. the entire
telephone system went on in Washington
for a solid hour and on the plane back
to Washington
word was radioed from the White House
situations room to Linda Johnson that
one individual performed the
assassination that sound like a bunch of
coincidences here mr. garrison not for
one moment the cabin was out of the
country to get their perceptions out of
the way troops are in the air for
possible when I control the telephones
didn't work to get the wrong stories
from spreading if anything went wrong
with the plan nothing was left to chance
he could not be allowed to escape alive
well I never thought things were the
same after that Vietnam started for real
it was an air of I don't make believe in
the Pentagon and CA those of us who'd
been in secret ops since the beginning
knew the Warren Commission was fiction
but there was something
something deeper uglier I know allan
dulles very well i briefed him many a
time in his house but for the life of me
i still can't figure out why he was
appointed to investigate Kennedy's death
the man who had fired him Delos by the
way was general wife been affected
2064
design my commission
I never realized Kennedy was so
dangerous to the establishment was that
Warren it's a real question isn't why
the how and the who is just scenery for
the public Oswald
Rubi Cuba a mafia keeps him guessing
like some kind of parlor game prevents
him from asking the most important
question why why was Kennedy killed who
benefited who has the power to cover it
up

hello viewers so TB Joshua's wife has
finally spoken up about the allegations
against her husband and she actually
said it in a trendy video now when she
was preaching in church and her message
is talking about staying away from
foolish people and she said that all
what bisa said in the BBC interview we
all lies against her husband and she's
actually claiming that she gangle with
others to tell lies against TB Joshua
and many people are asking could this be
true because from what she said she said
even when bisa came to The Synagogue
Church of all Nations she was already
married and came to be helped by the
prophet and actually made advances
towards TB Joshua but he denied giving
her any opportunity and because she
could no longer stay because he did not
even look at her she left and as since
then be lying about the prophet I will
show us this clip from what she said
about bisa and other disciples watch
this video guys over the years she tried
to make me a friend I said you cannot be
my friend because she doesn't know
anything about me today she can't say
anything about me because she doesn't
know
me and
so we begin to live in the synagogue I
saw
her
and I thank God that the prophet did not
give it to our
foolishness keep away from foolish
people stay away from them so that you
don't become what they
are when her time came to leave the
synagogue she
started the prophet is this the prophet
is that that and this he has no wife he
has no child I said all those times that
used to come come to my tiny sitting
room to come and tell me this one
happened h m said you don't know what is
happening oh this one happened I said I
don't look at those things though in
fact I don't see
them who was
I who was n to you then but you know
what with all she has said in this word
about Prophet J I'm expecting her to say
one
thing why did the prophet spot at you
publicly in this
church spot at your face publicly you
had a pro a pastor talking touch me here
touch me there this is a woman that
would say come and touch my breast she
has
boil oh there's cramp come and pray for
me stay away from foolish people so this
is actually what she's saying concerning
the claim that c Joshua molested his
disciples even Bola and this is actually
her response to it I'll be showing to us
some people's reactions on this on
YouTube where the video was posted
reacting to this on YouTube this person
here said nothing can ever change my
mind about my TB Joshua he is the most
anointed man of God I have met very
generous full of humility and he likes
doing things the way God wants it even
if it's against himself some people can
talk or say anything I do know that some
people are not humans probably Demons
Inside them so this is actually coming
from this person here on YouTube another
person here reacted and said even after
death he is still reigning what a mighty
God we have that has worked wonders
through his son CB Joshua H another
person here also also reacted and said
thank you Mama we know our father the
devil cannot change our mind the devil
knows what is coming revival is coming
Sons and Daughters of our Prophet God is
busy anointing his people H another
person also reacted and said she just
said nothing other than casting as
passions on bisa as leader of the church
and being a woman you have to set up a
panel to investigate these allegations
to unravel the truth about those
allegations against your husband
anything elide that is just living in
Deni and cover up H another person here
also reacted and said Christians who
adore the prophets more than God they
defend men more than sound Doctrine it's
a Pity to watch how instead of asking
God for discernment the TB Joshua f are
quick to refer to the victims as actors
when we people learn may God keep on
masking the Wolves let he who has an ear
hear what the spirit is saying to the
church so this is actually coming from
another person who is not even buying
what ti Joshua's wife is saying because
some of them are saying she's just out
there casting as passions on bisa
instead of talking about the real matter
what about other people who came out to
share their own experiences and how TI
Joshua molested them and all the evils
they claim is going on in Synagogue
Church what about them you didn't say
anything about them you are busy talking
about bisa was he bisa that actually
organized all these persons to come and
speak up against TB Joshua these are the
questions that people are asking and our
person here also reacted and said our
prophet Joshua is such a powerful and
wonderful Prophet Rich children of God
knows who he is it's NN of our business
to convince the world or soall Christian
we love and respect Prophet Tibi Joshua
always and person here also reacted and
said Mama EVN it is your ministry they
are fighting but the one in you is
greater than the one in the world H
another person here also reacted and
said God of prophet TI Joshua will
punish TI Joshua's enemies just watch
and pray I will never give up on Squan
and no one will divide Squan not even
BBC I know God of T Joshua is already in
control also reacting to this another
person here said Mama EVN be wise and
strong they are not happy that the
ministry is standing well even when the
man is is gone please throw the part of
your husband which is heavy silence
foolish people everywhere so this person
here is saying regardless of all the
attacks that is coming at this point in
time the wife should not respond to them
but should maintain silence just like TI
Joshua always does even when he was
alive when they were accusing him also
reacting to this another person here
said I don't blame her afterwards she's
safeguarding the investment her husband
left behind for her and her children the
major source of income take a look at
the congregation alone brainwashing must
continue as long as she can get away
with it h another person also reacted
and said if all they have been seen are
lies why are you defending it and how
can a good number of people come out and
just organize lies about someone like
that and this is actually one question
that people are asking this is not just
bisola alone this is a whole number of
people plenty persons that actually
pointing accusing finger on this person
and person also reacted and said so all
these people from different places
confirming what abisa said long time ago
before BBC reports all lying but
pictures of abysa figure to already
married when she came to synagogue is
not friendly to your claims H another
person here also reacted and said shame
on you you are covering for your late
husband God's judgment will come upon
you in such a way that you would't
expect just watch and wait for it you
are just compounding the issue you never
address issues raised and person also
said your husband was better at telling
lies no aspect of the accusations has
been contested you should repent the
reality will soon set in when the victim
Sue TB Joshua's estate including the
church you can deceive your congregation
but not everybody you had better start
selling your properties outside Nigeria
including South Africa so this is
actually what people are saying they're
saying she's just trying to cover up for
husband why some persons are saying that
all of this accusation are actually gang
up from the pit of Hell we can't tell
the one that is actually true and that's
why we are saying at this point in time
we just hope at the end of the day the
truth of the matter will come out and
also popular Big Brother NASA who is
known as fraud have come out to say that
tib Joshua is his Prophet that TI Joshua
PID paid his school fee in 2010 and also
gave him 8,000 n on a daily basis see
the way this online influencer reported
what fraud said he said TB Joshua paid
my University scholarship gave me 8,000
n every day in 2010 Big Brother n Justa
fraud so this is actually coming from
fraud he's saying that everything on the
internet and nothing but lies that t
Joshua is a real man of God and one that
helped him in 2010 to pay for his school
fee and people have actually been
reacting to this I will show us people's
reaction on this this person here said
it doesn't negate the fact that he did
all those other bad things as well H so
this person here is saying the fact that
he paid your school fee does not change
the fact that he molested those women
does not change the fact that other
things that were said about him are
actually true H another person also
reacted and said that does not mean that
he did not assault all those women I
wish someone organized a documentary for
people to also share the good things he
did for them we can't let BBC win this
so this person here is saying that they
wish that another documentary can be
done on all their lives that TB Joshua
help on all the lives that he
transformed with his good works another
person he also reacted and said I hope
you guys understand he could have done
all those and still be what they said he
was open your mind H even evil people do
good too I'm not saying he's guilty or
innocent no one knows yet but this
shouldn't be a reason to say he's not
capable of doing all the the bad things
and the real Christians can't even do
half of what he did but they will say
he's not a
Christian also reacting to this another
person here said that doesn't still make
him a good man those were his tricks to
cover up his evil acts by being generous
with money he got from people's
donations not his personal money even
devil did good to people and he's still
doing it for those who seek and believe
him there is lines between being
devilish and being generous you can be
human and still be ungodly there's a
tein line between humanity and godliness
H another person also reacted and said
many will come and say Lord Lord did we
not do Miracles and good things in your
name and he will say depart from me you
workers of iniquity God judges the heart
not the outward Shenanigans another
person here said the ways of God are not
the ways of man and we haven't seen
anything yet more people will be coming
out one after the other to speak on how
TI Joshua healed them and changed their
lives for good thank you my brother
fraud for coming out to clear the air TB
Joshua's Legacy lives on and this is one
thing about this whole matter because
many persons are supporting TB Joshua
while a whole lot of people too are
actually on the sides of the victim
saying that he truly committed the
crimes that they accused him of and
Nigerians are asking what could be the
truth of all this we will keep updating
you on this and give you new sight on
this story on a daily basis thank you so

Hello
My name is Aurora
And I'm a musician from Norway
I'm making this video because I'm afraid of what might happen
I might not be here tomorrow or the day after
So I want to make this video to keep the things that inspire me alive
Hello?
Yeah are you here?
Growing up in Bergin has been like the most beautiful gift I can ever get
I learned that you can create this whole world
by yourself
I guess you have the space to do it and that's so important
I've had a really special childhood with lots of magical happenings
And imagination above all
Apples are so magical
I believe every one has a secret wish hidden in them
And you have to wish it after taking a bite
The wonderful thing with making music with yourself is kind of
A way to stop time just in the moment
As I sit down and then you just play
I started writing melodies when I was 6 years old
And then the words came when I was 9
And after I discovered all of my greatest weapons in life, words
I never stopped
Music is not something you should keep from yourself
It can't be put in a cage
Because it's wild and alive
I have 2 sisters and they're both amazing creatures
Miranda.
That's me
And Victoria in the middle
Make-up artist and designer and me
Uh, yeah the first time I heard you sing was when you got that present from your friend
It was like uh a studio.
A session in the studio.
Yeah
You recorded one song.
And I don't think she knew how well she did
She was like oh, is this nice?
I was like Aurora what?
It's beautiful
We were always no eh worried about you
That you were gonna get bullied or picked on
Because you were so weird and you dressed so weird yeah
And we were so scared that it was going to be uh so tough on you
To go high school or one of these things
You were like no it's fine
But everybody loved you
These are some of my very very good friends
And I don't think I would've had so much fun in high school without them
I remember when I first met you I was like oh my g-d this girl is magic
I think we look very different then first impressions
Yeah hahaha
Let love conquer your mind
Going up?
Roria-roria.
A la tula.
Yeah.
And then lower es?
Even though you have so many fans and people say they love you
And have never met you it's really important to also have friends who
Actually know you and yeah know you as you not the artist
But we know you as you I know you as you
Let love conquer your mind
Warrior.
Warrior.
Just reach out for the light
Warrior.
Warrior.
I am high
This is Ivan.
She is one of the only people who knew me from when I was 6 years old
But also knows how it is being a bit more than just being a normal teenager I guess
I only think you've changed in that sense of course everyone changes
But I think the essence of you is still the same
And it just feels like you've grown into yourself
And just kind of figured out who you are
Do you feel like you're relaxed when you come
home or do you feel like you're constantly
Working?
Well I have ants in my feet that wants me
to go to the studio if I have a day off
Because I guess I feel like I have an opportunity
to make something new
You do a take and it's pitch perfect and you say no that wasn't really good
And we have to like yeah it was good
Like nah do it over again and we like ugh c'mon
You always seem to dance on the chairs
And now we have like 5 broken chairs in the studio
Which is really annoying
You're always moving in the studio though
Unless you're in like London or Berlin or
New York or LA somewhere cool
Not raining
I didn't travel much to big cities before
I was signed by my management
So music has basically taking me everywhere
The first time I went to a big city was a
Strange feeling of being in an ocean not really
knowing how to breathe or move
It was very inspiring as well because it was
a very different world
From the world I know
Do you believe in magic?
Yeah
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
He holds the gun against my head
I close my eyes and bang I'm dead
I know he knows that he's killing me for mercy
He holds my body in his arms
He didn't mean to do no harm
And he cries and cries
He did it all to spare me from the awful things in life that come
And he cries and cries
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
The gun is gone and so am I
And here I go
I used to come to this island very often when I was a child
It's quite strange how nothing can remind
me more of how things have changed
It used to be a childhood place because everything
is the same
The trees and the smell and the silence but
the only thing that's different is
You and the way you see things and the way
you think
And just like in fiction and in every addiction
Of fantasies taking over and wake me
The more I travel around and live and the
more people I meet
You realize how nothing is eternal
Nothing to me
I thought I should make this video so my voice
could keep talking after I'm gone
About things that I think is important to remember
And the lovely people I met
And things I like
And places I find to be the most beautiful
So those things will be remembered
I've been looking for the only one
But you don't seem to come
My way
I feel ali-li-live
I feel ali-li-live
I feel ali-li-live
I feel ali-li-live

Imagine a country that is ranked first in the world's happiness rankings every year.
This country is like a cold paradise covered with snow most of the year.
The people are incredibly calm, and there is no hustle and bustle.
The country's agenda is not busy with significant events every day.
Daily life is peaceful and simple.
Everyone is busy with their own business, and there is no chaos.
This country is one of the most amazing countries in Northern Europe and a place many people dream of living.
A civilization with a population of 5.5 million
called "A Land of a Thousand Lakes" because it has around 55,000 lakes.
This is Finland!
Although Finland may seem small on the map, it is an extraordinary country with an area of 338 thousand square kilometers.
Finland's population is relatively low for its area, which increases the country's welfare and per capita incomes.
The annual domestic national income of 310 billion dollars is approximately 60 thousand per person.
This is an amount that satisfies the people there financially.
However, per capita income is one of many reasons why they are so prosperous.
In addition to being one of the happiest countries, Finland is ranked 3rd on the list of the world's most powerful passports.
With this passport, Finns can travel to many countries without a visa.
 In addition to travel opportunities,
 a strong passport provides residence permits and business establishment opportunities in other countries.
That's why we can say that Finnish people are free in many ways.
In addition, Finland is home to many inventions and brands.
 Although they have a small population, they are working to make human life more manageable.
For example, Finland is the country that invented the sauna and brought it into society.
For this reason, Finland is one of the countries where sauna rooms are most famous.
Enjoying the sauna against the snow view is one of the favorite activities that relieve stress.
People from home and abroad enjoy entering Finland's excellent spas and saunas.
In this way, their bodies remain vigorous, and their mental well-being continues to be high.
Especially in the winter months, there is usually overcast weather in this country.
Sometimes it is 2 hours between sunrise and sunset.
Finland actually wasn't a top-rated destination until 30 years ago.
 However, Finland has always continued to develop slowly,
as countries have been deteriorating internally and struggling with new problems.
For example, they created a brand that was popular worldwide, and everyone wanted to have one.
NOKIA!
They invented the world's most the popular phone, which was very popular 15-20 years ago.
Yes, Nokia is a large Finnish company.
 I'm sure many people around you once collected coupons from newspapers and saw or used those famous phones like Nokia 32 10.
Although the brand lags behind brands such as Samsung and Apple, it still continues production today.
There is even a town called Nokia in the country.
Finland is located between Northern Europe and Russia.
It is a country that has a coast on the Baltic Sea and borders Russia to the east, Norway to the north, and Sweden to the west.
Finnish people are also thought to be of Central Asian and Siberian descent.
Historians state that today's Finnish people are not only of Scandinavian origin but similarly blended with people of Slavic origin
from Central Asia and the Siberian region of Russia.
Today, the northern part of the country is called Lapland, and the people in the north are called Lapans.
On the whole, more than 90 percent of Finland self identifies as Finnish.
The fact that Finland has genetics from northern peoples has made them look physically flawless and beautiful.
It is said that the most beautiful people today are in the Northern European countries, led by Finland.
Especially people who migrated to Finland from distant civilizations greatly admire the beauty of the Finns.
Physically, they have an incredibly perfect appearance.
So far, we have defined Finland by its high income, productivity and genetic beauty.
Apart from these, the country sets an example to the whole world with another feature.
Of course, it's education!
Finland is known as the best country in the world with its education system.
Education in the country is entirely free and given to everyone under equal conditions.
The teaching technique in universities is divided into two, standard and polytechnic.
While standard schools focus more on theoretical courses, polytechnic schools train students with practical applied courses.
For example, a person studying Engineering does not prepare for exams by memorising lecture notes.
Examinations are held in laboratories and training areas with hands-on experiments.
In this way, education is not only on paper but practically transferred to students and becomes permanent.
There is a 9-year compulsory education process in the country and there are no private schools.
Lesson hours are limited to only 3-4 hours per day and a maximum of 20 hours per week.
Moreover, students do not go to school all day, and there is no concept of homework.
Philosophy and logic courses are taught to students before courses such as mathematics and biology.
When children are at school, they feel at home and enter their classrooms by removing their shoes.
The aim is to enable children to acquire morality and manners before basic sciences.
In Finland, children blend into society as humble, respectful, punctual and keeping their word.
People in Finland are very trustworthy their minds are free and their hearts are conscientious.
For this reason, the crime rate in the country is also very low.
For example, in a study conducted in 2018, only 1.15 percent of crime was found per 100,000 people.
In a crime ranking made with 129 countries in 2020, Finland was ranked 118th out of 129 countries with the most crimes.
Today, the safest country is Iceland, while the most dangerous country is Afghanistan.
The most important issue in education is that students speak their mother tongue Finnish in the best way.
One of the things that will attract your attention the most when you go to Finland is the pine trees.
The country has so many green areas and forests that it is possible to see pine trees everywhere.
These trees look very visually pleasing both in summer and winter.
 Since the country does not aim for rapid industrialization and has less population, green areas do not turn into concrete structures.
Because it is not needed. Since there are many green areas, the country's air is also very clean.
First-time travelers to Finland may experience temporary dizziness and even nosebleeds,
as their noses will be exposed to high fresh air, especially if they come from an area with bad weather.
Today, Finland, Estonia, Iceland and New Zealand are the countries with the cleanest air in the world.
In other words, when you go to Finland, you can have a high-quality life, from the weather to nature, from the living conditions to the culture.
If you are to be there for a short time, you should enjoy the tree houses among the pine trees.
Imagine starting the day with such a view! How peaceful it looks!
Tourists, who come to this relaxing area in the north of the country,
 light fires together in the evenings and meet and mingle in the calm nature of Finland.
They eat Finnish food, listen to music and shop.
There are also many snow-made restaurants in such areas.
This snow-made business culture is quite common in Finland.
Even decades ago, their ancestors built similar shelters for various purposes and survived in these areas.
There is another unique activity you can do in Finland.
Especially if you will be there for a short time and your budget allows it,
you should go on the icebreaker trip in the north of the country.
 During the winter, lakes in Finland freeze and are covered with thick ice sheets.
This situation has created a different tourism sector in the country.
 People sail on "ICEBREAKER" ships, frozen lakes, and even the Baltic Sea and experience the beautiful moment.
 Similarly, these ships also provide transportation from Finland to Sweden.
It's more than just tourism and transportation.
Northern European countries also have oil reserves.
Norway, for example, began to prosper with its oil reserves.
After discovering oil reserves, these Northern European countries carried out regular sales to various parts of the world and were transported by ships.
In winter, these ICEBREAKER ships are needed to transport these oils by ships.
 Having so many functions, these ships are a boon for a safe cruise across the frozen Baltic Sea!
But nowadays they are mainly used to entertain people.
For example, the ship is approaching a shore, and people jump from the ship into the water in freezing waters of -20 degrees.
Of course, they do this with air-filled inflatable suits that protect them from drowning and the cold.
 Thus, swimming in the ice-covered waters of the Baltic Sea becomes just as enjoyable!
If you say that Finland is still not enough for me to be happy despite all this, there is another delightful opportunity in this country.
If you really like winter tourism and want to experience adrenaline in the snow-covered nature,
you can dive into the forests with the Siberian wolves called HUSKY and experience the adrenaline of speed.
It really makes you feel like you're in a Hollywood movie.
The scenery is magnificent, and going into the forest with the HUSKYs adds excitement.
For someone traveling from Siberia to Finland, this may mean little. However, every person from a distant culture should experience these feelings personally.
If we look at daily life in Finland, they are a European Union country and use the Euro as their currency.
It is difficult to go to Finland as they are a member of the European Union.
You need to get a Schengen Visa even for a short time to go to this country that has come out of a fairy tale.
For long-term residence, you must have a good command of Finnish and the second official language, Swedish.
This is one of their essential principles, not only for communication with local people but also for job acceptance.
For example, even if you receive a job invitation from Finland, you take the Finnish proficiency exams to practice your profession in that country.
You are required to get a good grade on the exam, such as B2.
So the first key to living in Finland is to master their language.
Helsinki, the country's capital, is located in the southernmost part of Finland and has a calm and majestic style as the north.
You can understand how elegant the city looks even when viewed from above.
Strangely, the rates of depression in this beautiful country are incredibly high.
 This may seem illogical and strange to you.
 Why are people depressed in a country with high quality of life, conditions, health services, education, and natural beauty?
Scandinavians, especially those in their 50s, are prone to suicide.
You may first think of the idea that the weather in Finland is cold and cloudy almost throughout the year.
This is, of course, one of the reasons that make the people there depressed.
But that's not the main reason. In Finland, people achieve what usually requires a lot of effort while still young.
Others take a different approach to the cause of the high suicide rates in northern European countries such as Finland.
Some claim that lack of belief is very common in places like Finland, Norway and Sweden,
and because there is no belief in an afterlife, people's resistance is quickly broken.
Perhaps believing in a religion is an essential factor in people's survival.
As a result, because of such reasons, people in their 50s in Scandinavian and Baltic countries reach a point of satisfaction, and life becomes meaningless.
 In addition, the inability to accept old age brings them to the point of breakdown.
On the other hand, Finland's border connection with Russia confronts them with the fear of a possible nuclear war and of living in bunkers.
Today, there are underground shelters in Finland large enough to contain 1 million people,
and people will try to hold on to life in these safe shelters in case of a possible disaster.
Finland has recently joined NATO with the approval of Turkey, thus reducing the public's fear of Russia a little bit.
Therefore, if Russia launches an operation against Finland, the 30 NATO countries will defend Finland with all their might.
Thus, as of today, Finland is safer than ever.
Goodbye.

and here it is the first aircraft
they've designed and built which is more
than half 53 in fact carbon fiber and
I'm standing under one of the incredible
Wings all the way from Wales and you
think inside the journey in terms of the
story that that Wing has made you know
we've got the ribs in there we have the
spa we have the stringers it's just
stunning and of course right at the very
end the upturned wings of the eagle the
winglets to make this aircraft so
incredibly efficient
one of the best things of all for me is
that I get to be one of the very first
passengers on board the Prototype
this is one of the five a350 test planes
to be built and it's still being used by
Engineers to test the aircraft to its
limits
and where better to go than straight to
where I feel at home the cockpit Peter
Chandler is the chief test pilot at
Airbus he was the brave man who took the
very first a350 to the skies in 2014.
some impressive displays here Peter what
are you testing in that first test
flight that first test right in fact the
first two flights we were what we call
opening a flight envelope so the normal
flight envelope that's the from the low
speed to the high speed and from low
altitude up to high altitude just
checking the handling of the airplane so
that we could actually identify the
natural characteristics of the airplane
the element of the Wings has made the
most significant difference
I mean the design of the wing is state
of the art in terms of the aerodynamics
and the fact that we have the ability
just to very slightly extend flaps
during Cruise so it's it's basically
changing very slightly the camera of the
wing only by maybe one one or two
degrees extension at the uh flats this
is interesting because the control
column is over to well to the right here
or to the left yes if you're the captain
yes since the mid 80s with the A320
we've had these side sticks as the uh
the means of controlling the airplane
like flying with them I I find it very
comfortable and it just cleans up the
cockpit so much you've got a nice Clear
View and of course the other advantage
of having the side stick if I could just
show you is
uh it allows us to have a table which
has two two modes we have a keyboard in
there which is the interface which we
can use for for example typing requests
for weather and that's the more
important setting is that which allows
you to eat
which is a major concern for all
Airlines
for your attention
we're taxiing out to the runway now and
the pilot to Captain has changed the
curvature of the wing so he's put the
slats at the front down slightly the
flaps at the back down slightly and that
means that we can take off
at a much lower ground speed than we
would without this happening and that's
because it provides greater lift at a
slower speed
so now
here we go
off we go full throttle
he needs to get to What's called the
speed of rotation so that he can pull
back on the stick the wings will lift us
into the air it's going to be beautiful
a350
Welsh videos
[Music]
so quiet again I'm sitting right next to
the engine and up we go how beautiful
[Music]
[Music]
it's very quiet inside I've got my
decibel counter here it's showing around
about 75 76 decibels which is well if
you consider that a normal conversation
is around about 70 decibels that's not
bad but the beauty of the two engines
here in the whole configuration of the
aircraft is What's called the noise
footprint outside so you know when
you're sitting at home you live near an
airport how noisy is the aircraft when
it's taking off particularly when it's
full throttle and generally with this
aircraft it's so quiet that the noise
footprint is held within the boundary of
the Airfield which is astonishing
I'm not in the cockpit I'm in front of
what we call the flight engineer station
from that station my job is to conduct
the test so of course I'm not able to
handle the aircraft because I have no
stick I have no first levels what kind
of things would you be telling the
pilots to do so the first test we have
to do in the the first month after the
first flight is to do what we call
stalls we have to stall the aircraft
which way which means that we have to
bring the aircraft to a given point
where it does not try anymore okay
there's a lot of people when they hear
stall they think their engine in their
car stalling it's nothing to do with the
engines this is all to do with the winds
exactly yes
[Music]
finding the aerodynamic stalling point
is one of the most important safety
characteristics of any aircraft
it's something every pilot has to learn
to recover from but thankfully Stefan
isn't going to be doing it today
setting the vors and yeah
much more difficult yes absolutely do
you really like flying This Plane oh yes
it's a very beautiful plane and it
handles very well so all the pilots are
delighted to Fighters
this is where my story ends it's been an
experience full of surprises and
unexpected discoveries but my full
appreciation of how much goes into
building an aircraft has only just begun
I'm back in Broughton and sadly the time
has come for me to book my own takeoff
slot and fly off home
this Airfield has been at The Cutting
Edge of Aeronautical Engineering for 75
years and it had a golden age back in
the 1940s but it seems to me as though
it's now within a new golden era it
really is at the Forefront of aircraft
design on a global scale and it's
fantastic because it's where I grew up
in flintshire in North Wales
thank you
thank you

[Music]
there is no devil the devil is the
police that's why we call them beasts
the slums of Nairobi dead bodies of
young poor men are turning up on the
streets almost every day it's an
underground war against crime the
community experts and insiders say they
are executed by the police without
charges without trial because they are
allegedly criminals one of them was
Brian this is his story
[Music]
a laQuan Paulie
num - Afra he and block big fans
mama Brio has lost her son Brian 19
years old executed while having lunch
it's been two days and it still all
feels like a terrible nightmare
Hey look a picture so much this is where
Brian was sleeping just a few days ago
the police suspected him of being a
criminal a thief but mama Breyer says he
was innocent
Hashima aqua to vita Vitalik welcome to
our opened opened upon gay and I grew
Freya noir so now Wang are too innocent
what an you are taught us you were to
working for you Brian had aspired to
become a reggae artist it's day four
after Brian's death
mama Brielle has to go to the city more
tree for his autopsy filming is
officially forbidden
the smell is pungent 20 to 50 corpses
arrived here every day almost all killed
by police
for Mom Abreu it's still all surreal
Joyce was Brian's friend and neighbor
here in her community in KY Ola is why
he was killed
Joyce says he was executed in broad
daylight along with his three friends
so we rented this way and we found that
our four boys were killed here
one was Lane here here and there's a
tree were inside I had they came to cook
lunch and they were done don't the
policeman on the one who gunned him down
can you enter the community is still
shocked about what they say was a brutal
execution by a police killer squad three
of the men died in here
the family has burned everything so that
their rooms can be empty
Begg homes joy shows us another chilling
piece of evidence the images of brian
and his dead friends broadcast on dan
dora crime-free one of the many facebook
pages that support extrajudicial
killings joy says the police themselves
post the pictures to instill fear and
label the victims as armed violent
criminals
I saw they were my friends like brothers
to me
and it hurt me a lot
here in the slum the community says the
police are slaughtering an entire
generation
that's why we always keep quiet there
are so many guys who have been killed
but you can't you can't say anything
yeah
the independent medical legal unit in
blue in Nairobi dr. Brian B changa is a
forensic expert for him cases like
Brian's are part of a larger pattern
being when Kenya is almost a death
sentence you more likely today from the
police than from the criminals the whole
scenario where there's a lot of crime
the police are trying to fight crime
that gives you a recipe for for some of
these extrajudicial killings the
executed are overwhelmingly young men
and they are poor like Brian the police
call them criminals
the police claimed the victims were
caught stealing or attacking their
offices but for dr. B Changa the corpses
tell a different story and she wants to
get the back entry wounds to the head
and she wounds to the chest
the main objective of of anyone who's
trying to shoot you in the back in the
head and the chest is not to immobilize
you it's to execute you we reached out
to the office of the Inspector General
phone interview several times we also
contacted I power the police's
independent oversight authority for an
official statement both repeatedly
denied DW requests for interviews in
person
one officer inside the system however is
willing to uncover the doings of
Nairobi's police but only anonymously he
fears he would otherwise be killed as
well he wants to be called modern cop
and says he's against extrajudicial
killings like that of Brian
extrajudicial killings happen almost
every other day everybody knows that
there are extrajudicial killings it's
impossible to give the exact figures but
modern cop guesses about ten people are
executed in nairobi slums every day that
would make it more than three thousand
five hundred police murders per year so
the procedure is as a cop you're given
an order you don't know where the order
comes from you're told hey this is
what's happening and now it's time to
shoot to kill and then you go you land
within that process if you don't get the
right guy you'll end up killing the
wrong guy and if you get the right guy
you also kill the right guy without
prosecution and nobody cares
for many police the otherwise vibrant
life in the slum is deemed worthless
outside the affected neighborhoods in
the rest of the country most killings
are not reported or downplayed crime is
rife the prisons are full and no one
remembers how the extrajudicial killing
started in the first place
modern cop explains the truth behind the
posted photos of dead corpses he says
that firearms are placed next to the
victims by the police to show they were
armed you will have to at least find a
way to place a fake pistol and retaliate
and say that the guy was also armed you
go do your thing but at the end of the
day the concept is you must make the
police look good however bad it is so
having fake guns on criminals that's
true
the police insist their victims
including Brian are all criminals and a
friend of Brian says yes they weren't
again but those times are long over they
gave up crime and even surrendered to
the police last year to conceal his
identity
we'll call him Olmos they shouldn't have
killed Brian
we had changed for real for real if
there's an investigation they should do
their investigation isn't that right
there are jails who were they built for
dead bodies our dead bodies taken to
jail al Moses but one example of a
former criminal who now lives with a
target on his back
despite pursuing a life of reform fear
and censorship mute all official counts
of extrajudicial killings local media
reports as of August 2017 that the
latest number of police executions is a
little over 100 in one year
in one year 100 people only there's
nothing like that a hundred people are
dying within three days 100 people are
dead within three days almost has lost
his friend Brian and says he knows the
police will come for him next I'm the
one on their hit list now I'm not
fearful because it's gotten to the point
where they even kill innocent people
the day I die is the day I will be happy
because I will no longer have to suffer
these struggles but my prayer to God is
that I do not die before the truth is
told it's day 15 since Brian's death his
mother his family and friends lay him to
rest in his rural area they lament that
Brian like so many other young men was
tripped off to deter procces and his
human rights his life and death devalued
[Music]
thousands of extrajudicial killings in
Kenya have been covered up and
unreported personal tragedies hidden
beneath the guise of police success it's
a sad certainty that Brian wasn't the
last young man they'll bury in Nairobi
Kenya
[Music]
[Music]

[Music]
taliban fighters rule the streets armed
with weapons once used by their enemies
we see them all over kabul
the taliban's return to power has
changed millions of lives especially the
lives of afghan women
i feel like a prisoner nothing is in my
own hands anymore
before i could do whatever i wanted
of course i'm very much happy you know
there is no word
we are living like other people in the
world
the taliban are back and so is their
ideology but what's it like living in
today's afghanistan
[Music]
we head west out of kabul into the rural
province of maidan wardak the mountains
here where taliban land when usnato
troops were still in the country
driving is tricky and slow roadside
bombs and air strikes have left their
mark
the whole area was a battleground the
damage lines the road
in a small mountain village we have an
appointment with dr roshana quadak 2
centimeter
and my these walls they were not
possible
dr roshanak is not only a doctor
she used to be a politician and she has
long supported the taliban
i was in the first
first parliament
25 to 10 yeah yeah
that that parliament was good parliament
no
not uh corrupt
and i
i'm proud that i was there yeah
this is my house
in her large garden dr roshanak takes us
down memory lane
she had believed in building a new
afghanistan governed by parliament she
tells us working with the taliban
not against them
instead war engulfed the country and she
quit parliament in disgust
we didn't want america
why they came to our country he didn't
want this this is our country
i can't remember anything good
because
development of the country
uh education everything was stopped
in the villages and the provinces
due to war
her patients are still suffering the
deprivation of that war
dr roshanak is a gynecologist and runs a
small clinic from home
my shoulders and neck hurt it makes no
difference if i eat or not
because you have 10 kids is there a cow
no yes but it has no milk
she sees more patients than before
now that fighting has stopped traveling
is less dangerous
with the taliban things are good now
it's peaceful
before there was a lot of war and
fighting
we always lived in fear
but now it's quiet
every pregnant woman we meet here wants
to know the sex of her baby
oh my god this is also boy
you see these
this is one this this this is the other
this is penis you see yes no you
a boy is power of a family
he can fight
and you know if there are more boys and
a family that family is much
powerful
in the village if they don't have boys
and they have girls they are weak
everybody can attack on them
some of the boys she helped deliver in
the past are now fighters
she won't comment on taliban atrocities
instead she points to their roots
taliban god or bad
you know
everybody has their own
judgment
for me
talib was afghan all taliban were afghan
when she's not treating patients here in
her own clinic dr roshanak also works
for the taliban overseeing female and
maternal health in their provincial
health directorate
before we leave she takes us up the
mountain behind her house a fiercely
beautiful view turns her thoughts
towards the future
now i wish
for taliban to change their minds about
girls
without
activities of girls and ladies it's
impossible to
achieve development
it's impossible
[Music]
back in the capital dr roshanak's wish
evaporates
the regime is all male by the taliban
for the taliban
the drive through kabul reveals more
drug users and street children than
we've seen before
food prices are soaring
more than half of the population is
hungry
[Music]
in the evenings women sit in front of
the city's bakeries begging for a loaf
of bread
[Music]
i take the bread home and eat it with my
children
but it's not enough to fill our stomachs
i divide the bread in pieces and give it
to my children so that none of them dies
but our stomachs are never full
you will have a ministry spokesman in
asking about the whole goal
how do the taliban plan to help the
people they rule
we meet the spokesman for the ministry
of vice and virtue journalists who have
come to see you
blames the crisis on sanctions the
freezing of assets and massive aid cuts
imposed since the taliban took power
[Music]
for 20 years america and its nato allies
killed us with bombs and artillery
now they're trying to kill us like this
they are responsible for this the hunger
crisis is on them
his ministry makes sure people behave
according to the taliban's vision of
islam
we built the kind of state our nation
wants
our nation fought for islamic rule for
43 years and now we want to enforce it
[Music]
give us the rights of a free country
and let us make the decisions for our
nation
those decisions seem less focused on the
deepening economic crisis than they do
on policing the lives of women the
taliban want a gender segregated society
and yet girls who are still at school
dare to dream
who of you wants to be a doctor raise
your hands
but these girls will be out of school
long before they can study medicine the
taliban leadership has effectively
banned them from secondary education
on the street a rare sight a group of
women demonstrating for the right to
education and work
suddenly taliban fighters shoot live
rounds in the air
[Applause]
young women like aisha and her sister
are trying to find their place in this
afghanistan
i have lost myself since the taliban
returned to power
i'm no longer the girl i used to be
in the past i would feel proud looking
at myself i gave myself the name jasoor
the bold one
but now i have lost my spirit my hopes
are gone under the taliban
and it doesn't feel good
see at my home i use this to make coffee
you know
your country use this to make tea aisha
used to work for a un project she also
studied journalism at a private
university now she has lost her job and
had to leave university because she
can't pay the fees
how many cups of green tea do you
usually have a day
the sisters still go shopping without a
male family member to chaperone them but
that could change if the taliban gets
stricter on public gender segregation
aisha says she is largely withdrawn from
public life she used to be politically
active attending a lot of meetings
now she rarely sees people outside her
family
instead of talking in public she writes
in private
my country is tired tired of betrayal my
country you are songless and voiceless
aisha is angry she blames the west for
abandoning afghanistan to men who limit
her life
i would make sure that women could
choose any job they wanted
they would be allowed to study and to
live freely
the men would stay at home for a while
to learn what it is like to be a woman
to be prevented from working and
studying
at home they would understand how
difficult it is to be confined to a life
of raising children
they would understand what kind of life
of khan women have to tolerate alone
[Music]
but aisha's ideas and afghanistan's
reality are very very far apart
[Music]
at one of the many checkpoints in kabul
we meet izatola
he joined the taliban as a teenager and
left home where most people are farmers
to come to the big city
he now lives in a container next to the
checkpoint he wants to officially join
the taliban security forces to serve the
islamic emirate
the islamic emirate is a sharia based
state for muslims
all the people from my area are happy
and support the islamic emirate
we want sharia low and the islamic
emirate is enforcing that
that's why we want to work for it
when we suggest many afghans fear
taliban rule izatola and his friends
brush aside such
that is the concerns
they say talk of explosions targeted
killings beatings and arbitrary arrests
is nothing more than western propaganda
all the people in this container are
taliban and we're talking to you
we all walk the same streets
[Music]
we leave the traffic and bustle of kabul
and head for a very special mountain
village
[Music]
istalif was a foreigner's darling when
u.s and nato troops were still in the
country
its traditional pottery attracted
throngs of visitors from the capital
especially foreigners but they are gone
and so is their money craftsmen like
abdulmanan are in trouble now
hiranzu workshop with his son ramesh
we were in the market one day
we have a shop there too
many families had come to istali for a
picnic and to buy things
but then men from the ministry of vice
and virtue showed up
the taliban told families from outside
that they should neither come for
picnics
nor to shop anymore
has affected our business
i like working with clay and netting it
for my father i like every part of the
process
it's our family craft
but if no one buys their wares the
potters of istalif may not be able to do
what they have always done
pass their craft from father to son it's
a traditional life which abdulmanan says
has survived much but now feels under
threat again
there's no reason to attack us
we're professional artists who just want
to earn a living
but our eyes have seen so much war
after the war with the russians the
mujahideen fought each other then the
taliban arrived and there was more war
and now we have this
all of this is very scary
on the walk down into the village we
meet no one
the bazaar is deserted too
most shops are open but there is not a
single customer inside
we have traveled a hungry unsettled
country of vastly different truths
voices of descent are under threat
there is more security
but no reconciliation

in 1924 paul amadeus dinock had been
teaching the german language in greece
dying of tuberculosis he wanted to
return home to switzerland before he
left he gave hundreds of pages of
handwritten notes to his favorite
language student georgios papahatsis
dinock thought translating his notes
would help papahatsus in his study of
the german language they said goodbye
never saw each other again papahatsus
began translating the pages there were
whole passages about a coming nuclear
war colonizing mars and a global
government sections about flying
vehicles holographic technology and
contact with alien life
poppahotsis thought it was a science
fiction novel but as more and more the
text was revealed papahatsus was shocked
at what he discovered this wasn't a
novel at all this was actually dienoch's
personal diary dinock wrote about how he
went into a coma and woke up two
thousand years in the future
it seems that paul amadeus dinock had
experienced some kind of time slip that
caused him to fall asleep in the year
1921 and wake up in the year 3906
he spent a whole year in the future and
he wrote down everything he saw
this is his story
[Music]
it's may 1921. paul dinock is teaching
his college language class when he
starts to feel dizzy he has a history of
illness and eventually ends up
hospitalized he develops a terrible
fever and for the next few hours he's in
and out of consciousness he perceives
different men and women gathering around
him but he's too weak to communicate
when he finally wakes up his hospital
room is different people are dressed in
unfamiliar clothing and they're speaking
a strange language being a language
teacher he recognizes a few words from
english and swedish adenoc tries to
communicate but nobody can understand
him one of the doctors recognizes his
language the doctor tries his best to
communicate in broken german he tells
dnoc his name is actually andreas
northam a famous physics professor who
had an accident now dinock says he has
no idea who andreas northam is but he's
shown a mirror and he sees a stranger's
face looking back at him now dinock
becomes visibly upset and starts sobbing
he thinks he's dead or worse gone crazy
he cries that he's just a simple
language teacher from switzerland and
has no idea what's happening to him
the doctors seem to react to the word
switzerland and someone asks him what
year it is dinox says it's 1922.
a hush falls over the room after a few
seconds the older physician steps
forward and tells deenock but the ear is
actually 3906 now dinock doesn't believe
it the blinds on his windows are opened
and he sees buildings reaching through
the clouds vehicles that seem to defy
gravity buzz quickly past his window
suddenly overwhelmed he blacks out
dinock is watched carefully for three
days but he eventually recovers enough
to walk and he describes walls made of
crystal that give you a panoramic view
of the landscape objects are made of
pastel colored glowing metal that's warm
to the touch and he's led through a
corridor to a large room here he meets
two older men in white robes and at
first dinock thinks they're actually
priests or kings but they're actually
called electors with an eye these are
like elder wise men now up until this
time doc's doctors didn't believe he was
from the past they thought he was
suffering from some kind of brain trauma
but after questioning him for a while
the electors do believe him they have
knowledge of a rare psychic phenomenon
that they called a consciousness shift
where someone's mind or soul could be
transported into somebody else's body
and they think that's what happened to
dinock when andreas northam whose body
was being occupied by dinoc was injured
in an accident he was clinically dead
for 15 minutes doctors dropped the
temperature of his brain and they were
able to restart his heart it was at that
point the electors believed that this
personality shift occurred and the mind
of paul dinock was transferred into the
body of andreas northam two thousand
years in the future how does your
consciousness get beamed into the future
well enoch wonders about this too and he
asked the electors about it and they say
that time isn't linear that everyone's
consciousness exists all the time
everywhere you know even though this is
a rare event it is something that's
known to happen it's at this point that
a man named stefan is summoned now
stefan had been a close friend of
andreas northam and the electors decide
that only stefan and his doctors would
know his true identity to everyone else
paul dinock would be andreas northam and
enoch would assume his life now the
electors believe that if stefan could
help andreas northam regain his memories
that the personality shift could be
reversed and dinock would be sent back
to his own time so
stefan agrees to visit dinoc every day
to teach him about modern society but
dinock is mostly interested about what
happened in the past
even though the doctors in
60 understood the psychic personality
shift there was one thing that puzzled
them back in the 1920s dnoc was
suffering from something called
encephalitis lethargica sometimes called
sleeping sickness and people with this
disease have difficulty speaking moving
staying awake in the 1920s there was
actually an epidemic of encephalitis
lethargica that affected over a million
people around the world but even though
dinock had been living in the future for
a full two weeks he never slept he would
stay awake throughout the night reading
books learning the new language but he
never felt tired and never actually fell
asleep he spent a lot of time using a
new piece of technology called oregon
schwager now up until now the most
modern learning device dnoc ever
encountered was a book but he describes
the regan schwager as a handheld device
with moving three-dimensional images
that glow in the dark with sound music
and narration
like an ipad kinda yeah and denox
doctors encouraged him to learn anything
he wanted about the past but they did
not let him study the 20th century they
didn't want him to have knowledge about
any historical event that he might be
able to change so what did he learn well
the years 2000 through 2300 are the most
difficult for the human race
overpopulation and regional conflict are
the biggest problems we face
in 2204 we finally colonized mars over
60 years the population on mars grows to
20 million people but
in 2265 there was some kind of
planet-wide catastrophe like a large
impact event that wiped out the entire
colony and we never tried again in 2309
there was a medium-scale nuclear war
that devastated most of europe only the
baltic and scandinavian countries
survived which is presumably why their
language is an english scandinavian
hybrid now this war would be global and
last for 80 years and most of the human
population would be wiped out in 2396 a
new world government called a redstot
was established and this ends the
ancient period of history and marks the
beginning of modern history oh no what
one world government
yep when the red stop was formed in 2396
it was a one world government designed
to end the global war and it was a
government like we'd recognize today
corrupt pretty much it was run by the
wealthy and powerful and countries
around the world still had strong local
nationalism so they resisted the new
government for about 200 years
eventually citizens stopped electing
politicians and businessmen instead the
higher offices were held by scientists
philosophers and humanitarians
what that actually makes sense it does
and over the next 300 years society
starts to reform in 2823 a world leader
named torahild proposed a new economic
system and this system is not based on
global scarcity like our system instead
the system is based on global adequacy
it is at this point that people start
working for the greater good
initially they work for 40 years of
their life in their chosen field and
after that they retire all of their
material needs are met by the global
community now as time goes on technology
and automation progresses so much that
when paul dinock arrives people work
only two years of their life they're
educated through their childhood and at
age 17 they enter the workforce they
work very hard for about two years and
then they retire able to pursue any type
of life they want they work for two
years that's it that's it because in
3906 all material needs are met food
shelter clothing education even
entertainment and money as we know it
isn't used anymore instead value is
placed in art and science you could
absolutely pursue a career if you wanted
like andreas northam was a physicist but
you didn't have to work if you wanted to
live a life of leisure as long as you
completed your two years of service you
could do that sounds to me like some
hippie star trek socialite paradise bull
i admit it does kind of sound like that
you know socialism and communism never
work right i know that which is an
interesting twist to the story let me
ask you why doesn't socialism work
because no matter how good most people
are there's always selfish jerks who
want more that's right human nature gets
in the way but by the year 3906 we're
not human anymore wait wait what at
least we're not human as we think of it
we evolve into something else
paul dinock talks of a phenomenon that
starts to happen to people around the
year three thousand it's called the
needlework needlework niebelwerk what i
say in the future the human brain
structure evolves and a new sense organ
is developed this gives people the
ability to perceive a new plane of
existence and access to vast spiritual
knowledge they call this ability over
sin sons or supervision and it gave
people a new cognitive ability instant
enlightenment sounds pretty good well
you would think this new sense gave
people feelings of incredible happiness
and spiritual peace and it's described
as divine joy acceptance of death a
disregard for all worldly things
and this feeling came all rushing at
once people freaked out didn't they they
did and everyone who experienced the
needlework died they died with looks of
ecstasy on their faces but they were so
overwhelmed that they couldn't survive
the event until
33.82 on september 6th of that year a 76
year old man named alexis volky was hit
with the navel work needlework
niebelwerk what'd i say
but he survived
and from then on everyone survived the
nibel work eventually the switching on
of this new perception was a common
process in everyone's life homo sapiens
then gave way to a new species of human
homo occidentalis novus or new western
man so in the future human nature itself
changes present humans are hardwired for
survival competition and success even at
the expense of others so this utopian
vision of the future just wouldn't work
today but what if you can change the
actual wiring of the human brain itself
in 3906 there were hardly any laws they
weren't needed anymore people actually
worked for the common good because
that's how they're evolved selfishness
is a concept that is studied as an
archaic remnant of a less evolved
species people in 3906 can't even
imagine themselves acting like we do
today now paul dinock finds the future
people very strange he says they act
like carefree children but you have to
admit
there's a part of you maybe even a large
part that would like to go back to some
moment in your childhood where all your
needs were met where you had no fear no
envy no anxiety as denox friend stefan
says all these things that you view as
strange who is to say that they are
childish instead of divine
interesting point
but dinock wonders how would these
people survive an outside threat like
contact with aliens well stefan says
they've already been contacted many
times and it turned out fine
humans in the future are aware of
intelligent beings living in the solar
system and around the galaxy but they
aren't interested in communication with
us instead they prefer to study us from
a distance but stefan does admit they
have intervened with the human race on a
few occasions like when our species was
close to self-imposed extinction and
enoch learns that these extraterrestrial
beings experience their own kind of
enlightenment needlework neighborwork
what i say
so aliens leave us alone to walk our own
path
when paul dinock was a young man he fell
in love with a girl from his village
named anna
though anna felt the same her family
wanted her to marry someone else now
during one of their last moments
together they were sitting on a hill
surrounded by blossoming wind flowers
which are white buttercups now paul
wanted this day to last forever because
he knew he was losing her so finally she
said enough for today let's go back and
paul said promise me that i will see you
again and she said she promised and the
next time we're here i'll make a wreath
of wind flowers for you to place upon my
head now paul never did see her again
and this was something that tormented
him his entire life he would constantly
pray for signs of anna's eternal love
for him but those signs never came okay
cute story but
where are we going with this let's get
back to the crazy stuff well having
spent a year with the people in 3906
d-noc developed a relationship with a
woman named sylvia they decided to go
for a day trip they traveled in what
deena called avigiosa which was a flying
vehicle that could take you anywhere on
earth almost instantly he decided he
wanted to visit his old village though
sylvia didn't know that's where they
were going so they spent the day talking
and exploring eventually ending up on
that same hill where paul and anna were
all those years ago now wind flowers
were also blossoming that day and while
they sat and talked sylvia made a wreath
of wind flowers she then looked at paul
dinock and said enough for today let's
go back she hands him the reef and asks
him to place it upon her head
reincarnation yes dinock feels like he's
hit by lightning he sees this as the
sign he's been praying for his entire
life later he reflects on the day with
stefan who reminds him that time isn't
linear stefan believes sylvia is the
reincarnated soul of anna who 2000 years
later fulfills her promise that night
paul dinock feels his eyes getting heavy
and he wonders if he'll finally be able
to sleep at night from now on and his
last thought is how much he missed this
feeling finally andreas northam falls
asleep for the first time in a year and
back in 1922 paul dinock awakens from a
year-long coma
[Music]
the story of paul amadeus dinock is such
a good one but what really happened to
him was his story real was it a hoax a
money grab
well there are a couple of options the
first is that he was telling the truth
that he really had a paranormal
experience that sent him 2 000 years
into the future and if you read the
entire book it seems plausible it's over
300 pages and it's full of details there
are hundreds of names places dates dnoc
talks about future technology like
cryonics the internet flying vehicles
teleporters and even something that
sounds like a holodeck i can't come
close to covering everything here but
i'll link to the book if you want to
check it out if you're a kindle
unlimited subscriber no sponsor it's
actually free to read the second option
is that while in his coma paul dinock
experienced what he thought was reality
but was nothing more than vivid dreams
you could dream in a coma well it
depends on the illness and injury of the
brain but people definitely can and do
and if he was dreaming for a year that's
plenty of time to create a richly
detailed vision of the future world but
there's one more theory we have to
consider and it's the theory that i
believe
it's that paul amadeus dinock never
existed
even though the story of paul dinock is
not that well known it's been covered in
a few blogs and podcasts and videos and
in all of them the same photo of paul is
used it's the photo i used in the
thumbnail it's this one here but what's
never mentioned
that this is actually the mugshot of
daniel towhill who was arrested for
theft in new zealand in 1908. also paul
dinock lived in zurich in the 1920s
that's not that long ago the city has
records of every citizen living in the
city at that time as does the city of
athens where dinock was supposed to be
teaching but there are no records of
anyone by this name not even close now
georgia's papahatsis the translator and
publisher of the story says he tried to
find enoch years later but couldn't he
attributed this to the fact that dinock
fought for germany during world war one
and actually changed his name before
moving to neutral switzerland so we
don't know what his real name is yeah
it's convenient well what's even more
convenient is that the original
handwritten diary is gone papa hatsu
said that while living in greece during
the war his house was searched by the
greek military and because the notes
were in german the soldiers seized them
and never gave them back yeah sounds
fishy it does and others have noted the
similarity of this story to a story
written by h.p lovecraft called the
shadow out of time lovecraft's story is
written in the first person like a diary
and the protagonist goes into a coma and
wakes up at a different time
well deenock woke up in the future and
lovecraft's hero wakes up in the past
still there are similarities and the
shadow out of time was published in 1936
so if the story was inspired by
lovecraft then there's no way it was
written by dinock in the 1920s so this
greek dude read a hoax i don't think so
giorgio's papahatsis was a highly
respected law professor and intellectual
he even served as a jurist on greece's
council of state that was like their
supreme court so this was a serious guy
he was very interested in administrative
law social studies and humanities and
these are the themes we see in paul
dinock's diary it's likely that the book
was written as an intellectual exercise
and exploration of human spirituality
and papahasis added the sci-fi twist and
the love story as literary devices now
he probably didn't mean for anyone to
take it seriously as something that
actually happened but there's no way to
know for sure i mean this is the age of
the internet and if you write a story
about a time-traveling coma patient
people are going to believe it
i certainly wanted to

hi friends my name is Benjamin and today
I want to tell you another chilling
story on May 24th 2014 a Saturday
blessie goding Co a 56-year-old woman
completed her workday and was heading
home she resided in Northshore Auckland
New Zealand with husband of 30 years
Antonio
Ginko their connection traced back to
their childhood in CBU City Philippines
where they attended the same school over
the years they dated married and had
three children B Vincent and John in
2004 the family of five relocated to New
Zealand Auckland became a beloved home
for blessie offering her opportunities
to indulge in activities she cherished
such as exploration walking and
discovering new places she held a job
that brought her satisfaction and had
formed strong bonds with friends in the
area the Goden Co family embraced their
life in Auckland evident in their shared
experiences and joys just a few days
prior on May 20th blessie celebrated her
birthday with her children enjoying
lunch at a pub in greenh high and a
family dinner at Urban turban in wyard
quarter unfortunately Antonio couldn't
join them as he was on a work trip
abroad set to return on June 15th
blessie couldn't wait to see him again
they were a very close family and were
happiest when they were all together on
the 24th of May blessie godo concluded
her work at Tower insurance at 700 p.m.
although her regular working hours were
until 5:00 p.m. she had willingly taken
on a few extra hours of overtime without
pre-arranged transportation as her
co-worker bahula sha who usually gave
her a ride had left early earlier
blessie opted to take the birkenhead
transports 973 bus from lower Albert
Saint to burkdale
Road the bus stop was located
approximately 700 M from her home and
the short walk should have taken her
just 5
minutes however that evening blessie
never reached her destination Upon
returning home from work at 3:15 a.m.
the next morning blessy's daughter be
noticed her absence concerned be
contacted her two Brothers to inquire
about their mother's whereabouts but
they were
unaware in an effort to locate her be
used to find my iPhone app and
discovered blessy's phone on a grass
Verge in salesbury Road a mere 100 yard
from their home at 6 a.m. in the
vicinity of The Verge bee also found
blessie shoes and the Tupperware
containers she used for her daily lunch
at work when the police arrived they
initially considered the possibility of
a hit and run giv in the scattered
nature of blessy's belongings on the
verge they contemplated whether blessie
might have been struck by a vehicle and
was now disoriented and lost somewhere
however it became evident that a more
Sinister event had
transpired a young girl residing on the
same street reported hearing a woman's
scream at the time blessie disembarked
from the bus nearest to her home
Witnesses observed a BMW car overtaking
the bus carrying blessie leading the
police to scrutinize 28-year-old Tony
Douglas Robertson when questioned
Robertson claimed ignorance about
blessie and the circumstances
surrounding her
disappearance notably the police were
already familiar with Robertson as he
had a history as a convicted sex
offender and
abductor just 5 months prior he had been
released from prison and was under an
extended supervision order complete with
24-hour GPS tracking Robertson's
movements were monitored due to the
ankle brace GPS tracking device which
revealed his presence on the street
where blessie vanished around the same
time investigations also revealed that
he had spent time on the 24th of May at
esdale cemetery and returned the
following day this prompted the police
to search the cemetery where with the
assistance of a police dog blessy's body
was discovered 2 days after her
disappearance her remains were concealed
under pine scrub covered with foliage
and briis and wrapped in a sheet
tragically blessie had been subjected to
rape and fatal stabbing following the
discovery the police arrested Tony
Robertson charging him with rape and
murder despite the evidence he pleaded
not
[Music]
guilty the prosecution asserted that
Tony a stranger to blessie spotted her
walking home as he drove down burkdale
street according to their case he ined
intentionally struck her with his
vehicle resulting in her leg breaking in
two places allegedly Tony then picked
blessie up placed her in the back of his
car and drove to his burkdale apartment
just before his 8:00 P.M curfew to avoid
triggering any alarms the witness
testimonies aimed to support this
narrative one witness testified that
they observed blessie alighting from the
bus at burkdale and walking away briskly
they also noticed a white sedan-like
vehicle overtaking the bus and speeding
down salesbury Road the court heard from
an 11-year-old girl who lived on
salesbury road she recounted that on the
night of May 24th while she was cooking
dumplings with her sister she heard the
sound of a car and a high-pitch scream
at around 7:30
p.m. her testimony detailed it was
driving up the hill from esdale and it
stopped then I heard a high-pitched
scream from a lady and then there was
nothing after that the girl added that
the car then drove off in the direction
of burkdale
Road in the courtroom the prosecution
contended that upon Tony's return to his
apartment he parked his car in the
garage beneath his home and proceeded to
commit heinous acts against
blessie according to their case Tony
raped blessie strangled her and brutally
stabbed her in a frenzied and violent
manner ultimately Landing the final blow
to the
throat the prosecution further argued
that early the following morning Tony
wrapped blessy's lifeless body in a bed
sheet placed it back in his car and
drove to esdale cemetery to dispose of
her they suggested that this timing was
deliberate allowing Tony to avoid
violating his curfew forensic scientist
provided testimony stating that luminal
testing conducted in the area where
blessy's body was discovered revealed a
bloody path indicating the likely
dragging of a bloodstained object
through the grass the evidence suggested
that blessy's body had been transported
through parts of the cemetery before
being placed on the ground and dragged
to the location where it was eventually
found details of blessy's injuries were
presented in court by pathologist Dr
Carl Wen he testified that blessie had
suffered multiple deep stab wounds with
one being so violent that lyns from her
necklace were embedded in its depths Dr
Wen also said that when blasie was
stabbed in the throat it injured her
windpipe he emphasized that all of
blessy's injuries were inflicted while
she was alive as evidenced by the
presence of blood in her lungs
pathologist Dr Carl Wen testified that
blessie sustained numerous injuries
making it challenging to pinpoint a
singular cause of death he suggested
that a combination of factors including
strangling blunt force trauma from being
struck by the car stab wounds and inze
wounds likely contributed to her death
Dr Wen expressed difficulty in
attributing death to one specific injury
but opined that the stabbing probably
hastened her demise the court learned
that blessie suffered various blunt
force trauma injuries such as broken
ribs legs teeth and abrasions consistent
with postmortem
dragging Dr Wen proposed that blessie
was likely strangled first as a means of
subduing her followed by the stabbing
and insize wounds
evidence of manual strangulation was
presented including bruising on her neck
a fractured thyroid and broken
capillaries in her eyes according to Dr
wyen blessie might have survived being
struck by the car with prompt medical
assistance however instead she sustained
further injuries including sharp force
injuries leading to significant
bleeding when questioned about defensive
wounds Dr Wen noted that there didn't
appear to be any explaining to the jury
that such absence is not uncommon in
cases where the victim succumbs to
violence Dr Wen also informed the court
that samples from blessy's body
underwent DNA testing revealing the
presence of Tony's seminal fluid on her
body this testimony added crucial
forensic evidence to the prosecution's
case the court was informed that Tony
wearing a GPS anklet at the time had
been at esdale Cemetery hours before the
murder occurred occurred the prosecution
argued that this indicated premeditation
contending that Tony was scouting for a
location to hide a body they asserted
that he had planned the murder in
advance selecting the burial site before
choosing his victim the GPS data also
revealed Tony Revisited the cemetery
early the next morning leading the
prosecution to believe he dumped
blessy's body at that time crown
prosecutor Michael Walker underscored
the significance of these visits
suggesting they demonstrated that the
defendant was planning to kill someone
and that the trip to the cemetery was
for scoping out where to dispose of the
body the court heard that blood was
discovered in Tony's car and a knife
along with some of blessy's belongings
were found buried in the rear of his
property the knife bore traces of
blessy's blood evidence of damage to
Tony's BMW was presented in court
detective Constable Shane pagee
testified that the vehic vehicle showed
recent signs of damage a majority of the
rear passenger seat belt was missing
when I dismantled the seat belt being
the Anchorage point there was about a
meter I think 940 mm of the seat belt
was missing it had been cut detective
further testified about additional
damage inside Tony's car including cuts
and scratches on the leather seating in
the back he noted a significant area of
replaced foam inside the back seat and
blood found on the passenger's seat and
in the car's trunk autog Glazier told
the court that on May 26th he was
summoned to Tony's residence to repair a
broken BMW
windscreen he found it unusual that the
wind screen had already been removed
from the car and he observed blood
inside the
vehicle when he inquired about the cause
of the damage Tony claimed it happened
while joking around with
friends according to Tony a friend
slipped on the Bonnet and crashed
through the glass sergeant from the
serious crash unit testified that he
believed blessie was intentionally
struck he suggested that she was hit
while walking on the pavement basing his
belief on the discovery of a tire
imprint on the verge near where her
belongings were found in the defense's
case Tony admitted to causing blessy's
death but asserted that it was
accidental and not premeditated
according to his defense Tony claimed to
have panicked after accidentally hitting
blessie and then inflicted the injuries
found on her body to make the incident
appear like a random attack he
maintained that all injuries were
inflicted
postmortem during the trial Tony
dismissed his legal team and chose to
defend himself Tony told the court that
he denied the prosecution's version of
events and emphasized that he panicked
after The Accidental
Collision he argued that putting blessie
in his car and driving home was solely
to comply with his curfew
I put her straight in my car to comply
with my curfew that demanded I be there
at 8:00 p.m. and stay there until 6:00
a.m. Tony contended that the prosecution
was wrong in asserting premeditation
emphasizing the absence of witnesses to
the car
accident he explained his presence at
the cemetery on May 24th and 25th by
claiming he was trying to buy prohibited
substances regarding the DNA evidence
Tony argued that it was microscopic
topic and scientists had difficulty
isolating and testing it the defense
presented contrasting opinions on
blessy's injuries from another
pathologist Dr Chapman who disagreed
with Dr wen's
findings Dr Chapman's report read in
court suggested that blessy's neck
injuries particularly the fractured
thyroid could have been caused by
another blow to that area the report
stated that the bruising on blessy's
neck did not appear to be from
fingertips Dr Chapman's differing
opinion particularly regarding the
likelihood of blessie inhaling her own
blood aligned with Tony's defense that
he caused the stab wounds postmortem to
simulate a random attack during his
testimony Tony claimed that when he
placed blessie in his car he believed
she was already dead he asserted that he
orchestrated the scene to look like a
random attack due to being under the
influence of methamphetamine at the time
Tony also denied the rape allegations
arguing that the DNA evidence
specifically his seminal fluid found on
blessy's body resulted from
contamination and police
malpractice however the jury did not
accept Tony's version of events and
found him guilty of both rape and murder
subsequently Tony received a life
sentence with a minimum non-parole
period of 24 years along with preventive
detention for the rape in New Zealand
preventive detention is an open-ended
jail term allowing for indefinite
imprisonment or recall at any time Tony
appealed the verdict asserting that
blessy's death was accidental and
contending that the jury should have
been given the option to find him guilty
of
manslaughter the appeal was rejected and
a subsequent attempt at the Supreme
Court also failed as it was determined
that Tony had not presented anything
during the trial to indicate that a
charge of manslaughter could have been
considered he was denied further leave
to appeal the revelation of Tony's
criminal Past after his sentencing
provided a stark context to his
actions Tony had been granted name
suppression during the trial concealing
his previous convictions for child
sexual
offenses the details of his criminal
history were kept from the jury in 2005
when Tony was just 18 years old he
committed a heinous crime in Tanga he
kidnapped and molested a 5-year-old girl
act on Instinct a local officer
suspected Tony's involvement found him
with the girl and discovered the
distressing scene with the child's pants
down Tony was found guilty of seven
charges including indecent assault and
attempting to abduct two other children
he was sentenced to 8 years in prison
for these
crimes released in December 2013 merely
5 months before blessy's tragic murder
Tony breached the conditions of his
release twice within a short span
as a result he was considered a danger
leading to an extended supervision order
mandating a decade of monitoring and a
24-hour GPS tracking anklet Justice
Edwin Wy the judge overseeing this case
expressed serious concerns about Tony's
propensity for
harm I am satisfied that Mr Robertson
poses a very considerable risk indeed I
consider that it is likely that he will
commit an indecency on a child under the
age of 12 Years years and that he will
abduct a child for the purpose of sexual
connection the evidence compels the
conclusion that he is impulsive and that
he is unable to control his anger and
aggression Mr Robertson has a
predilection for and a proclivity
towards sexual offending he has shown No
Remorse indeed he continues to deny it
the tragic circumstances surrounding
Tony's release the monitoring order and
the subsequent violent attack on blessy
go Co caused profound pain and anger for
her family the fact that Tony despite
being monitored with a GPS anklet was
able to commit such a heinous crime
added to the grief of blessy's family
who believed that the system had failed
to protect them a government report was
conducted to examine the handling of
Tony's Case by the police and
Corrections however the report found no
fault on their part and concluded that
Tony alone was responsible for blessie
despite the lack of blame signed to the
authorities the report made 27
recommendations for improving the
management of high-risk offenders
blessy's husband Antonio expressed
disappointment and Devastation at the
inquiry's findings stating that he
believed Corrections did not have the
capabilities to manage high-risk sex
offenders and that in his opinion the
offenders managed the
system the Department of Corrections
Minister noted that Tony had served his
full 8-year prison term for the previous
offense and had been denied parole
multiple times due to his lack of
remorse however residents of burkdale
Auckland were not informed of his
release into their
community in a statement released by The
New Zealand Police Antonio expressed the
profound loss his family was
experiencing blessie is the light of our
home and without her we will be lost in
darkness right now we are just trying to
pretend that everything is okay but deep
inside we are broken hearted we have
been robbed she is Gone Too

this is Williston North
Dakota a modern-day Boom
Town beneath these streets lies a 100
billion barrels of oil and now this
little town is the epicenter of one of
the biggest oil booms in American
[Music]
history as millions of people lost their
jobs in the recession oil companies in
North Dakota were starred for
workers over the last 4 years more than
15,000 people have packed their cars and
set out for America's latest oil rush
with only 1% unemployment and a rapidly
expanding
population this drowsy Prairie town has
just been launched into the 21st
[Music]
century
Williston is located on the western edge
of North Dakota 2 miles underground sits
the bachan formation a deposit of crude
oil the size of West
Virginia two new inventions hydr
fracking and horizontal drilling have
given oil companies new access to the
bachan and Unleashed a drilling frenzy
2,000 new wells are going in this year
and when fully developed an estimated
40,000 Wells could cover the region
drillings spread faster than anyone
expected but who's been responsible for
guiding Williston through the
boom I don't believe we have made any
major mistakes as a
community Ward's been mayor for over 17
years the entire boom has happened under
his watch and as you might expect he
sees it as a blessing I had a dream from
early on that someday we would be the
best little city in America and that's
still my goal and dream now are we there
yet no we're not there yet but I think
we're closer than we were 15 or 18 years
ago this is an area that was settled by
homesteaders hardworking people cared
about their neighbor good work ethic we
want the new people who come here to
pick up on that and and still be people
of character who care about their
neighbor and are good
[Music]
citizens we were obviously looking
forward to increased oil activity I
don't think anybody dreamed that it
would happen as rapidly as it has or
have as great an impact as it has and so
that's where it's been a challenge but
there's just there's an intensity here
that exists only in Williston North
Dakota and that intensity is exemplified
by the town's rig studded Horizon
Williston has welcomed the explosion of
big oil but is there a limit to their
Hospitality what's off limits do you
feel for
[Music]
drilling man I don't know that I can
answer that question um let me think for
a second about that clearly local
government won't restrict drilling so
how does the average will Estonian feel
about having their Town invaded by Big
Oil everything's lacking but on the
other hand our budget's got 2 billion a
year coming in off oil tax that nobody
really did anything for and it's kicking
ass like I've had guys here I work for
that are major millionaires they still
go to work every day cuz that's what
they do and I've come to realize is they
don't fit on a beach you take a
75-year-old or we in the cowboy boots
ber shorts and a hat it's not vacation
this is a very conservative State you
know and everything is very conservative
and don't spend it until 5 years later I
mean like our city commission we had was
great when it was still a small town and
you had small town matters but then I
mean this isn't the little small town
that it used to be it's good the rapid
growth has strained all of williston's
Public Services more people means more
crime and the police find themselves
struggling to keep up looked just like
the Batmobile like for real and it was
swerving all over the road and it was
feeding and so when he pulled them over
the guy actually got out of the vehicle
and had the Batman outfit on we kind of
call it like a mini Vegas officers are
getting DUI crashes at 9:00 a.m. on a
Sunday morning as well as Wednesday
afternoon during lunch the boom hit so
fast that the city's still playing catch
up so we have a lot of people getting
off the bus that come to the police
station and ask well where's your
Salvation Army where's your churches
that let people stay there and there
really is nowhere to
stay we even had an instance where there
was a lady couldn't figure out why her
heat wasn't working and when they came
to fix it they pulled the skirting off
and there was a family living underneath
their trailer if I'm having a really bad
day or I think about the problems in my
life and I come to work I feel
normal while the town scrambles to catch
up to the boom workers moving to
Williston face their own set of
challenges I chill I smoke fake
weed and I play video games this is
Tommy it's noon on his day off and he's
wasted back in Michigan I can buy a can
of smoked oysters for
9 here it's $140 something no I'm never
happy that I came out here but there's
money here any of the bad stories you
hear about Willis in North Dakota they
aren't the locals they're people that
have come here to work if you ask me if
I have a cigarette for you and I have a
full pack and I tell
you I don't have a cigarette for you
what does that
[Music]
mean I don't want to live in North
Dakota it's flat it's dirty it's dusty
they got rough Winters they got rough
Summers I mean out of all the places in
America North Dakota is probably one of
the godforsaken places I'd ever want to
live
I've missed my birthday I missed my
wife's birthday school's going to start
on the 5th and I'm going to miss the
first day of school for my kitten
Gardener I'd rather assure they have a
home to live in and their bills are paid
rather than being there for the
moments it's responsibility I
guess because there's nowhere to live
temporary housing developments for Oil
Workers have sprung up all over North
Dakota these man camps are filled with
men who depend on Big Oil whether or not
they support the
industry I'm making real good money most
money I ever made in my life I'm blessed
place to stay place to eat can't be more
satisfied I got into it in my 20s and
I'm in my 50s now been married 32 years
but she's used to me working I talk to
her every night we do the Skype and that
kind of stuff so we can see each other
people bow down to it cuz oil is what
makes the money you know but I'm just
I'm different man you know I I don't I
don't I hate it I'm not going to be here
alone our government right now is kind
of anti oil blocking all their permits
and stuff like that on federal lands
which is stupid but that's just my
opinion it's bad for everybody it kills
everybody everybody in my family I know
is eat up with lung cancer and stuff
like that from working in the oilfield
you know I think the people that are
against it is uh a minority of people
it's a hard living think twice about it
and go to college and get some kind of
degree where you don't have to work it
like this you know they're drilling
safer than they ever had so there's no
reason not to drill why do you work in
oil all I can do to make money it sucks
you
know the small town lifestyle that once
defined Williston is gone and high rents
are chasing out many elderly residents
who no longer recognize the town they
grew up in we had a black [ __ ] spaniel
who my father rescued
and what do he name him
[ __ ] not realizing that there was
anything
remotely politically uncorrect about
that or that it revealed any
Prejudice
uh you need to learn those changes my
name is Debbie Hayden and I've lived
here for 57 years I was born born and
raised in Williston it's not easy for
that we golden oldies because we're
leaving North Dakota in dropes we can't
afford the rent anymore the building
owner gets offered a buy out kicks
everybody out and what was a $500
apartment is now 2,000
or500 and I think a lot of the local
towns people we're almost in a State of
Shock Williston is still called
Williston but it's not our hometown
anymore
[Music]
oil work is a young man's game many will
stack cash and return home but the new
Williston will be shaped by a generation
of workers who choose to stay and build
a new life here I've been out here about
3 weeks something like that yeah I
thought it was going to be hell like
North Dakota what the [ __ ] is in North
Dakota besides oil this is going to suck
but then um there actually is cute
little girls running around here and
there's a college here I mean it's just
a normal town that has a bunch of oil
dudes here mean know I'm 24 I realized
if I can grind this out and actually uh
you know like just keep my head down to
the Grind Stone just keep doing it I
mean I can actually see a career in this
it's weird I got here and I found out
within a couple days
uh that my great-grandfather's from here
so I just
uh I think it's cool that I'm here we
expected Williston to be overrun with
brawling rough necks corporate interests
and America's jobless the reality
however is less
Sensational the boom has created
problems but the town is not spinning
out of
control what's obvious is that the
changes are
irreversible old Williston is gone and
no one knows what will take its
place but so long as oil companies are
turning a profit Williston will remain a
Boom
[Music]
Town I am

what starts out as the Best Day Of isra
sablani's Life
soon turns into a nightmare
while posing for her wedding photos in
beirut's SciFi square a massive
explosion tears the city apart
it's just before 6 pm on August 4th 2020
when an uncontrolled fire breaks out at
one of the hangars at the Port of Beirut
in Lebanon seemingly after welder Sparks
flew while they were fixing a hole in
the wall
nine firefighters and a paramedic are
deployed to the scene but they have no
idea what the true extent of the
disaster is
their initial belief is that the hangar
contains fireworks but when they report
back to the command center the team
tells the fire chief something is amiss
then a gigantic explosion rips through
the foreshore of lebanon's capital city
foreign
the blast killed 218 people an injured
seven thousand more hundreds of
thousands would be left homeless
hanger 12 housed much more than just
fireworks it contained over
2750 tons of Highly explosive ammonium
nitrate at about 607 PM the warehouse
fire started sending plumes of smoke and
soot billowing from the roof of the
building eyewitnesses say it was
followed by a burst of light and showers
of smaller Sparks which looked like
fireworks less than a minute later a
massive blast erupted setting off a
bright ball of Fire
a shock wave moving faster than the
speed of sound tears through downtown
Beirut footage on social media showed a
white Dome engulfing large parts of the
city basically water vapor forced out of
the air by the shock wave
a red Brown Haze of smoke and Ash
followed it
experts would later concur that this
Haze of red Brown smoke was the
strongest indicator of an ammonium
nitrate explosion the Shockwave blew out
windows at the Beirut Airport terminal
about five miles from the port
the blast was so intense that it was
heard as far afield as Cyprus about 125
miles across the Mediterranean
seismologists at the U.S Geological
Survey equated the force to that of a
3.3 magnitude earthquake in fact it was
so powerful that a team from Sheffield
University estimated that the blast was
equal to one thousand to one thousand
five hundred tons of TNT roughly a tenth
of the intensity of the nuclear bomb
which ripped through Hiroshima
structures at the epicenter surrounding
warehouses and grain silos housing about
15 000 tons of grain were flattened
several dark ships were blown out of the
water and damaged by the explosion
including the five-star Orient Queen the
393 foot long passenger Cruiser capsized
due to the force of the blast killing
two crew members it also carved out a
460 foot wide ground crater which
immediately filled with sea water laying
waste To Hangar 12 and most of the ports
critical infrastructure the cataclysmic
explosion with a radius of about 1.85
miles is believed to be one of the
largest non-nuclear blasts recorded to
date the streets of Beirut were visibly
shrouded in Carnage entire building
blocks in nearby neighborhoods and
business districts in the city's North
were leveled including in the nightclub
District uprooted trees overturned
Vehicles collapsed roofs and metal
structures lay buckled and twisted in
the wake of the explosion the powerful
blast resulted in the electricity Supply
being knocked out which dealt another
devastating blow to rescue efforts
according to reports the devastation was
so severe that military bulldozers were
used to clear roads for firefighters in
ambulances but hospitals were
desperately overwhelmed by the blast and
had to turn away injured people due to
the sheer number of wounded according to
the World Health Organization several
hospitals were destroyed by the
explosion and at least 20 other health
care facilities were severely damaged
most injured people were treated for
secondary trauma to the upper
extremities due to shattered glass
St George Hospital located less than a
mile from the blast side had also been
destroyed but was still treating people
on the ruined pavement outside other
damaged medical centers continued
providing care to people in car parks by
flashlight as the human toll of the
explosion escalated even so many more
wounded had to be turned away due to
capacity the blast reportedly damaged
more than 200 000 households it's
believed many of the displays found
shelter through Aid agencies like the
Lebanese Red Cross the hospitality of
fellow Lebanese as well as friends and
family the state however has been widely
criticized for being absent regarding
relief initiatives for disaster victims
protests broke out in the city days
after the explosion condemning the
government's lack of response
The Infernal Blaze for more than seven
hours enveloping the city with a thick
black smoke it filled the air with the
smell of sulfur and burnt rubber caused
by massive amounts of nitrogen oxide
released from the ammonium nitrate
explosion
according to reports the hangar was used
to store jugs of oil kerosene and
hydrochloric acid five miles of fuse on
wooden spools and an estimated 15 Tons
of fireworks The Perfect Storm just
waiting to happen yet despite the highly
flammable inventory the warehouse had
shoddy electrical Works no smoke alarm
and it was not even fitted with a
sprinkler system but a hanger 12 also
housed a dangerous secret
2750 tons of ammonium nitrate which had
been haphazardly stored in bags since
2013. ammonium nitrate is relatively
cheap to purchase
it is commonly used in the agricultural
sector as fertilizer and in the mining
sector as explosives for quarrying
several Terror attacks have used the
chemical including Timothy mcveigh's
1995 Oklahoma City federal building
bombing and the Irish Republican Army's
1990 London bombings
the question on everyone's mind was why
was so much ammonium nitrate stored so
close to the residential suburbs of
Beirut where an estimated 10 000 people
lived a mere mile from the warehouse and
who was to blame for the devastation
well it all started in 2013 when a ship
owned by a Russian businessman made its
way from Georgia to Mozambique docking
at the Beirut Port after more than a
month at Sea LaRosa's Merchant vessel
was carrying 2 750 tons of ammonium
nitrate on board when it docked in
Beirut reportedly due to technical
problems but the ship would never leave
the port again according to the vessel's
former Captain the owner was
experiencing financial difficulties and
had hoped to pick up some cargo at
Lebanon to make some extra money before
headed to Mozambique but the additional
load carried too much weight and the
crew refused to take it on this led to
the ship being unseaworthy and impounded
for unpaid Port duties the owner
abandoned the crew without paying their
salaries or the port duties The Vessel
and its four crew members were forced to
remain on board for 11 months because of
immigration restrictions they were
eventually released on compassionate
grounds in 2014
the explosive cargo was confiscated and
transferred to Hangar 12 or remained
until that fateful day in August 2020 in
the more than six years that the highly
combustible cargo lay dormant and
unsecured in Hangar 12 a flurry of
emails was sent by concerned Port
Authorities to government officials but
nothing was done
the first batch of emails was sent
sometime in 2014 after the ammonium
nitrate was first offloaded the former
director of Customs sent the emails to
an urgent matters judge cautioning
against the dangers of housing the
highly explosive chemical at the port
but he never heard back
according to Al Jazeera news one of the
emails asked the Marine agency to
re-export the cargo immediately due to
the dangers of it being housed in
unsuitable climatic conditions in the
hangar the letter even suggested
authorities sell the chemical load to
the Lebanese explosives company a 2019
report sent to the Lebanese government
on the threats posed by the combustible
cargo reportedly fell on deaf ears
officials ignored the port Authority's
warnings even after security risks were
exposed due to a hole in the wall of
Hangar 12. it since believed that Sparks
from welders fixing this hole led to the
devastating explosion while civilians
were trying to piece together their
lives amid the destruction which is
believed to run in excess of 15 billion
dollars Lebanese authorities arrested
more than 20 port and Customs officials
following the blast president Michel own
prom promised the nation a full and
transparent investigation would take
place but rejected calls for
international assistance with the probe
less than six days after the explosion
the government resigned amid violent
protests calling for transparency and
accountability for the blast judge Fadi
Sawan was appointed to lead the
investigation
still it would prove to be a slow and
frustrating task because all members of
parliament have immunity from any
criminal prosecution by law not a single
top official has ever been prosecuted
successfully for crimes in Lebanon
despite corruption and mismanagement
being Rife
but in December 2021 judge Sawan charged
the interim prime minister Hassan diab
and three former ministers with
negligence over the port explosion in a
nasty turn of events however two
politicians he indicted had him removed
from the probe claiming he was not
impartial Civil Society groups have
since lobbied for immunity to be lifted
so Justice can prevail
with no signs that the local
investigation will move forward a civil
case was filed in the United States in
July 2022 by the Swiss space
organization accountability now they are
seeking 250 million in Damages for the
survivors and hoped to uncover new
evidence to propel the Lebanese probe
forward then in April 2022 Spanish
authorities arrested a 43-year-old
Portuguese man on the instruction of
Interpol and the Lebanese government
Jorge morera was charged with terrorism
and causing the death through the use of
explosives morera is believed to have
ordered the ammonium nitrate while
employed with the Mozambique explosives
Factory a company spokesperson said the
chemical was ordered in 2013 but was
never delivered they were shocked to
hear the explosive material had
languished in a dilapidated Warehouse in
Beirut until the explosion Moreira has
since been released but is not allowed
to leave Spain until his extradition
hearing if found guilty he could face
life imprisonment in January 2023 the
judge responsible for the investigation
issued new charges against eight
officials after the probe had been
stalled for nearly 13 months
he ordered the release of five people
detained shortly after the blast in 2020
including Port officials a welder and a
contractor
as for the bride from the viral video
isra sablani well she also happened to
be a doctor and provided medical
assistance to the injured in her wedding
gown shortly after the blast
a month later the newly married couple
moved to the United States
more than two years after the disaster
the scars of the devastating explosion
remain visible as the Reconstruction of
more than 62 000 residential spaces and
over 20 000 businesses and buildings
destroyed continues at a snail's pace
today a statue made out of broken glass
Twisted steel and other materials from
destroyed homes and buildings stands
eight feet tall in the explosions
epicenter the figure of a woman holding
a sword serves as a reminder of the 218
people killed that day
a broken clock at her feet still shows
608 the exact moment of the explosion

on the 19th of July 1989 United Airlines
flight 232 took to the skies on what was
to be a routine trip from Denver's
Stapleton International Airport to
Philadelphia International Airport with
a stop on the way at O'Hare
International Airport in Chicago
but flight 232 would never make it to
its destination
disaster would strike Valley an hour
into the journey leaving the airplane's
crew fighting for the lives of
themselves and every single passenger on
board
United Airlines is a us-based airline
company that has been operating
continuously since 1931.
throughout the 1960s and 1970s they were
a popular choice especially for shorter
cross-country Journeys
though not the largest airline they were
still well respected in the industry
United boasted a fleet that remained
modern throughout the years with Douglas
dc-7s giving way to Boeing 737s then to
McDonald Douglas dc-10s as the company
matured
the plane flying as United Airlines 232
on the 19th of July 1989 was a DC-10
with the registration n1819u
the aircraft itself was 18 years old and
had seen a total of 43 401 flight hours
neither brand new nor so old that it was
nearing the end of its life
the crew on board had varying levels of
experience
57 year old Captain Alfred Haynes had
been with United since 1956 and had
flown more than 7 000 hours in the DC-10
first Officer William records 48 years
old got his start at National Airlines
in 1969 then flew with Pan-American
before joining United in 1985.
he had only around 600 flight hours in
the DC-10
finally 51 year old flight engineer
Dudley Dvorak had been hired by United
in 1986 but had accrued only 33 hours in
the DC-10
also on board were eight flight
attendants and a total of 285 passengers
many of whom were traveling with young
children Seated on their laps United was
running a Children's Day promotion at
the time whereby children under 14 with
an accompanying adult could fly for just
a penny many passengers had taken
advantage of this promotion hoping to
reach their vacation destinations with a
massively reduced fare
at 209 PM United 232 took off from
Denver with an uneventful climb to
cruising altitude the aircraft leveled
off at 11 277 meters or 37 000 feet and
remained there for an hour
the flight proceeded exactly as
scheduled until 3 16 PM when a violent
jolt shook the plane and everyone on
board
the jolt was accompanied by a loud bang
almost immediately the autopilot
disengaged and indicators showed Captain
Haynes that the number two engine had
malfunctioned he tried to reduce power
to that engine but found the throttles
jammed the crew were able to shut it
down completely but as they did so they
discovered they could no longer control
the plane with their control columns
flight engineer Dvorak found that all
the hydraulic systems essential for
controlling the plane were alarmingly
fully depleted all attempts to use
auxiliary power to bring these systems
back online proved unsuccessful
the plane entered a fugoid cycle a
pattern of flight where the plane moves
up and down in a wave-like pattern
at the same time it began banking
further and further to the right
the crew could find no procedures for
dealing with this situation
even a desperate radio call to United
Airlines maintenance yielded no results
in a stroke of Good Fortune 46 year old
Denny Fitch a DC-10 flight instructor
happened to be on board as a passenger
he recognized the rolling pitch effect
the plane was experiencing
since becoming an instructor he had
studied the crash of Japan Airlines
Flight 123 which occurred just four
years prior
that flight had also lost all Hydraulics
and had also endured similar up and down
fugoid Cycles before crashing
after speaking to a flight attendant
Danny Fitch was taken up to the cockpit
there he worked with the flight crew to
quickly determine what the plane could
and could not do
they found that they were able to
exercise some rudimentary control and
steer the plane to the right by
adjusting the power to the remaining
engines
at the same time they could adjust their
pitch to counteract the fugoid cycle
Captain Haynes asked Fitch to take
control of the throttles so he could
focus on the control column
despite the precarious situation the
crew remained calm and collected even
lightening the tension with the
occasional joke
Fitch was recorded saying
I'll tell you what we'll have a beer
when this is all done
to which Captain Haynes replied
well I don't drink but I'll sure as hell
have one
the crew was able to turn the stricken
plane towards CU Gateway Airport
as they did so Captain Haynes requested
that air traffic controllers keep them
well away from the city itself
a sign that despite his calm humor he
understood the gravity of the situation
as flight 232 came into land a last
minute adjustment was made
unable to line the plane up properly
with Runway 31 as planned the crew aimed
instead for Runway 22 the exact place
where rescue vehicles had assembled to
await their Landing
these vehicles were quickly moved out of
the way
the plane approached high and fast much
faster than was safe with the landing
gear deployed before the plane touched
down it began to bank sharply to the
right
the crew increased thrust to the right
engines to counteract this role but it
was too late
the right wing struck the runway
breaking off as the rest of the aircraft
slammed into the ground
the fuselage broke apart from the
impacts and the fuel ignited
the aircraft disintegrated in a massive
Fireball with the mostly intact cockpit
and tail sections coming to rest in the
cornfields adjacent to the airport
even with fire engines already on scene
the fire was so intense that it burned
for more than five hours
the crash and fire were so violent that
First Responders were doubtful anyone
could have survived and yet many did
185 people lived through the crash with
one Survivor later dying from their
injuries
indeed not only did many people survive
but in many cases they helped one
another Escape The Burning wreckage of
the plane
passenger Jerry schemmell for example
lost a friend in the crash but escaped
the wreckage himself only to go back in
to save an 11 month old child
despite the actions of the surviving
passengers and the prompt response of
Emergency Services
112 people lost their lives in the
disaster
the investigation into the crash of
Flight 232 was Swift but not
straightforward
the main focus of the investigation the
number two engine was missing crucial
disc fan components that could not be
found at the crash site or in the
immediate area
its manufacturer General Electric put up
a bounty for the missing components
which was claimed when a farmer found
them in her field three months later
test results were conclusive the engine
disc van had developed a fault when it
was manufactured back in 1971.
the steel used had an impurity which
caused it to fatigue and crack over time
finally giving way mid-flight
United Airlines maintenance Personnel
should have caught this fatigue crack
early on but it was found that
procedures at United Airlines paid
little attention to faults such as this
one
the NTSB found that when the disk failed
it did so with explosive force which
damaged not only the engine assembly
itself but also part of the tail rear
elevators and the Hydraulics causing
them to leak out until empty
this explained why the crew had
experienced so much difficulty
controlling the plane
after the investigation was concluded
and the findings published many changes
were made in the aviation industry newly
built aircraft were given updated
hydraulic systems to prevent a loss of
hydraulics United updated its
maintenance procedures and flight 232
became a case study demonstrating
excellent crew Resource Management in a
crisis
indeed the crew worked together so well
that when challenged with a recreation
of the disaster in a simulator test
pilots could not match or exceed their
performance
the crew was highly commended for
carrying out what was referred to as an
impossible Landing Captain Haynes
received many awards and much of the
recognition though he always insisted
that credit was shared equally with his
fellow crew members who had all survived
the crash with serious injuries
Captain Haynes would go on to be a
public speaker on Aviation safety and
would appear in many interviews
describing his experience that day
a memorial to those who lost their lives
was erected years later the dc-10s in
United's Fleetwood continue to fly for a
number of years until they were
eventually retired in 2001.
though the crash of United 232 resulted
in the loss of many lives were it not
for the teamwork Ingenuity and
Incredibly calm response of The Crew The
End Result could have been significantly
worse

this video is brought to you by
storyblocks I'm not exactly sure what
the hell yeah
hello my name is Adam Sandler
[Applause]
1999 with his stand-up SNL and iconic
movie roles under his belt the 1990s
were truly Adam Sandler's and the winner
of the best comedic performance is
Adam Sandler
[Applause]
starring in a brand new motion picture
called Big Daddy all right here we go
and we're both losing weight keen on
writing and starring in comedic roles
Sandler was in his element
the wind at his back in 1999 Adam
started happy
Adam Sandler we're a real happy player
the world saw a wacky unserious comedian
but with Adam there was more than meets
the eye and only one person knew it
some of us thought you were actually
completely out of your mind when you
cast Adam Sandler in this movie
[Music]
what the [ __ ] is your problem he just
makes me laugh
go [ __ ] yourself he's funny to me
our first movie is Punch Drunk Love
starring Adam Sandler in a radical
departure from his usual brain dead
comedies and the headline is Sandler can
really act in 2002 director Paul Thomas
Anderson took what most saw as a risk
and cost Adam Sandler as the lead in a
dramatic role it started with a hunch
but when Paul met Adam on the set of
Little Nicky he said he wanted a work uh
together and do a movie together and I
was just excited and he went to work and
despite it being new territory Adam
didn't take much convincing were you
instantly ready to do this yeah I was
instantly in Paul wrote that movie for
me and I was like oh [ __ ] yeah I think I
could do that that was I was nervous but
I was there's no way I was going to say
I'm not doing this yeah every 10
products you bought and mailed into them
they'd send you a certificate for 500
miles which is a true story a guy went
and bought thousands and thousands of
dollars worth of putting that equaled a
million frequent flyer miles
how much did this cost you cost me a
little over three thousand dollars
that would get you a million entire
Minds who would never have to pay for a
ticket the rest of your life so that
helped but but the main impetus was
wanting to write something for Adam
it's insane
let's go to the bathroom
you see this as a critical time for you
and are you anxious about the way you'll
be received you didn't wonder why me I
mean I love this guy's movies but what
the hell am I going to do in this world

being I'm happy I met this guy I was
excited to to try to accomplish
something that I haven't uh really done

[Music]
only three months after his marriage in
September Adam said goodbye to his
father Stanley Sandler I was very tight
with my dad when he was sick I was with
him as much as I could that's why you're

I was your college roommate for Christ's
sake you don't remember me yeah very
cool very cool good to see you Burrows
it's Johnson by 2007 Adam's experience
with grief had changed him artistically
I get that you're in pain but you got
each other in rain over me Adam's
character deals with the trauma of
losing his wife and daughters in a plane
crash alongside Don Cheadle Sandler's
suffering is heart-wrenching you had a
family and you suffered a great loss why
why are you asking me are you trying to
focus me and until you can discuss that
friends talk to each other about what's
going on in their lives
we can really talk about that this is
all just an exercise
as an actor are you trying to find some
sense of balance between doing comedy
and drama I had three daughters how do
you feel that this movie is going to
take you in a direction of more of being
more serious this is not something I
thought about ever doing this just
happened they adored me Johnson this
script was so long it was written really
well and moving and it broke my heart
and thought and I felt it at the same
time and then I just decided that when I
committed to it to try to do it the best
I could
Adam typically one to cooler shots was
finding that he found comfort in
relinquishing control to talented
directors ultimately it was just Paul
Thomas Anderson writing me something
when I'm with these great guys it's kind
of relaxing in a way knowing that
they're not gonna move on until they're
happy you know I've only done a few
heavy parts and this by far is the
heaviest and it is not an easy life for
an actor who does that and I was I am
more than happy to run right back to
Comedy just enjoy my life a little more
maybe Adam had grown up a little but
growing up does it have to be so serious
[Music]
2010 Adam cements his return to family
comedies grown-ups is the culmination of
a nearly 20-year-long friendship group I
always want to do stuff with these guys
forever you know I'd rather be with
people I know and I trust who's ready to
get their funeral on so we kind of do it
to do it all together we do it as a team
it's summer
we shoot
it in a lake and that doesn't make you
want to go nuts we kind of live in one
place together our houses all near each
other
we all got kids they all hang out
together
it's pretty good pretty good
on the set of his movies Adam is
worshiped but offset he's never been
widely accepted the critics have said
I'm going to read you my favorite ones
critics haven't necessarily always loved
no your work this movie is the last nail
and Adam Sandler's coffin another said
he's no longer a movie star and another
one called you a man-child first off let
me say thanks for dressing for the show
I appreciate Adam doesn't have really a
great wardrobe what a great outfit that
is you got
Adam Sandler in this movie Jack and Jill
won a record-setting 10 Razzie Sunday
night what does this mean again it means
I can't stand you being
rezzy for worst picture of the year goes
to what do you think
[Music]
when it comes to Adam Sandler there is
one thing we can't agree on that no one
can agree whether or not Adam Sandler is
funny it doesn't matter what the
critters say do you care about like ah
you know it doesn't matter that much to
me I know what they're gonna say every
movie they're gonna say they don't like
it is that something you pay to pinch to
is that something that's bothered you I
have a love in my life
it makes me stronger than anything you
can imagine not very family oriented man
in general well let me start by saying
congratulations I hear babies on the way
and even better I hear it's yours
absolutely I'm addicted to him I love
being with him and uh when I'm not with
them I'm very very depressed I believe
in the hard work and what I'm trying to
accomplish but I just mostly want to be
able to have time with my family and and
give them a good childhood keen on
simply providing for his family Adam is
able to shut off the noise as well as
the bus you know when people talk about
your career they talk about these ups
and then the Downs ups and the Downs man
I don't know what the Downs have been I
got into acting in comedy to try to do
the best I could I loved every movie
I've made I've never in my entire career
phoned one thing in I also see a couple
of grads here today following my path
and becoming a fellow five-time Razzie
Award winner that stuff doesn't hurt me
anymore I think it hurt me 20 years ago
trying to make funny movies and trying
to make kids laugh that was my goal
which if it does happen don't be upset
call me and I'll teach you the proper
way to laugh all the way to the bank
I've been on a plane before you know
we're just talking about that movie
punch drunk love and uh this is a very
nice thing for you there's actually
Oscar buzz yeah how do you feel about
that the Oscar thing the Oscar you know
that's not that's not very San leerian
right now you're doing so well that you
actually start your own production
company Happy Madison Productions yes
the whole goal of the company was to
keep my friends employed first of all

awards they don't make a tuxedo out of
sweatpant material
number two uh if I uh buy some weird
freak accident won the thing uh you know

I know my friends would cut his head off
and make a bong out of them
[Applause]
[Music]
I was with Ben he got a walk a Fame star
and I went and visited him and I said we
got to do a movie together right
[Music]
and I said we took my brothers he said
yeah I was thinking that too
[Music]
I was disappointed in you for quitting
piano
making a similar thought Adam connected
to something very deeply in this guy we
lucked out got to do this together and
it was deep and that was you know you
know it was very moving to me let's get
it together
[Music]
shut the [ __ ] up
in 2017 Adam made his biggest step back
into dramatic acting with the meyerwood
stories was this something that you took
on because it was a challenge or did you
feel it was a natural progression at
this stage of your life and career it
was just just luck that this guy wrote
an amazing movie and handed it to me
it's the most I ever studied before a
project I read it and knew it was a
great movie and it was we didn't start
shooting for like maybe five months
after and I I would study my lines every
night just didn't want to let Noah down
because I didn't want to let the guy
down oh it's our career it's our life
it's movie to movie you can't exactly
say I'm doing this next and then that's
it you don't know what's coming next

the BBC investigation reveals human
rights abuses including torture rape
forced abortion and enslavement of
Nigerian British South African and
American Nationals who are members of
The Synagogue Church of all Nations the
BBC says evidence was meticulously
gathered for more than two years at a
formal presentation and private
screening of the 90minut documentary
titled disciples The Cult of TV Joshua
guests from the media civil society and
religious organizations of the view that
although the leader of the church is not
alive the institutions of State Should
fish out questionable characters we use
philanthropy to hide their deeds it is
not an indictment on the church it is an
indictment on who is
accused and it's it's quite unfortunate
that he is not alive to to defend
himself all this would have been very
very good if he is still alive and when
he was alive what move were taken to
confront him with these issues and get
him convicted the death of a person does
not mean that the issue is dead there
are
equally important and many victims who
have suffered as a result of the man's
atrocity we have to be bold as African
journalist to tell it as is once it
affects people the church is a corporate
entity so the fact that the head of the
church is dead it's it's a committee
it's a they have a they have a board of
trustee so the law can go after the
board of trustee this kind of enous
criminal conduct or act cannot take
place without something happening the
BBC said the investigation started
before the death of TV Joshua on June 5
2021 in response to why took long to
bring the allegations to public space
although some critics say the
documentary is an attack on Christian D
in Nigeria the BBC
disagrees the church synagogue probably
started even way before I was born now
this is it for the generation who we
have told this story who have seen the
film decades to come if that church the
name is still standing we would always
remember this film we would always
remember this story so now this one I'm
pushing out to our institutions in
Nigeria what are we going to be doing
what are we saying yes the pastor is
late but for all I
know the institution the church in
question was built on his name the
action on his name the call is for
government to beam his search light on
the many TV joshuas investigate the BBC
documentary and do what's right with
within the confines of the law if we
keep talking a lot about this is beyond
TB Joshua there are so many TB Joshua
out there um in form of religious
leaders some of them are political
leaders because we also need to put this
in the brother around relig about
leadership whether within the Christian
faith or Muslim faith or whatever Faith
leaders must be held accountable we're
find this out there already and nothing
has been done so far so and I think for
me is about the role of our institutions
to ensure that they have further in
investigations done happen well what has
happened now and the kind of coverage
that BBC has given the story I think it
will go a long way in encouraging more
people to come out and it also go a long
way in sending messages to you know any
institution or any individual anywhere
with currently perpetuating similar uh
uh acts you know because you never can
tell that might be people who are
replicating TB Joshua somewhere in some
corner of the country or in some of the
glob right now this type of issues
worries us disturbs us and at any point
we add our meetings or we hold meetings
we discuss them but the problem is we
know them it exists we hear them every
day we even feel them and we
discourage people of God from this I
mean patronizing this type of people
born on June 12th
1963 in arid coko in Uno State Nigeria
TB Joshua founded The Synagogue Church
of all nations in 1987 with a few
members and later expanded to have large
followers within and outside Nigeria he
undertook philanthropic activities and
in 2011 forbs listed him as the third
richest Pastor in Nigeria with an
estimated net worth of between1 and $15
million the consensus now is that the
government should muster the will to
check human rights violations
exemplified by the BBC
report

[Music]
each day around 20 volunteers give it a
try with one dream at heart
to be part of the Great Legion family
hello
I would like to join the League you want
to join the legion nationality Avenues
do you have any toiletries
yes I looked at the website I took a
pair of flappers three Underpants three
t-shirts a toothbrush shower equipment
to be a candidate here you need few
material stuff it is best you are
motivated
engaging is a radical change of life at
21 Stan is well aware it is really
something you wake up one morning and
say to yourself I am going to the
Foreign Legion I called my family I told
them about everything I will go to the
Foreign Legion and for five years they
may not hear from me specifically and I
came here at once Stanley Japanese is
not the only one to give it a try this
morning
at the same time a Spaniard Algerian and
Brazilian come to the nogen fort
foreign
unlike any other the Foreign Legion is
renowned worldwide each year 8 000 men
from all countries come knocking at its
door
it's from now on that the tests will
succeed each other for these new
recruits keep your bag here
place it well on the line here begins an
echo battle on average the legion admits
one candidate on eight
now you will do pull-ups you have to do
your utmost
first elimination test pull-ups an
effective exercise that already allows
the recruiter to Mark the right elements
that is the case with Stan
we see that he is a good athlete
he has a good physical build
at the nogen Ford selection is just at
its beginning
before the next schedules candidates
must make sure to stay fit
on their own initiative physical
activities come one after another
Stanley gavanese seems particularly
involved and motivates the troops
good good good good good one more one
more just one yes
we have to do it we are all in this we
have to help each other we are all in
this together
but the journey is far from over
second decisive stage for candidates
thorough questioning
okay guys all right guys stand up and
follow me
here nothing is left to luck each
candidate's past is scrutinized its
shirts turn to be questioned
from now on candidates must forget their
past like Stan the gavinis the legion
gives them a new personal story
so is all the write down in this table
wait first okay
once you leave here apanga is your new
identity if the Corporal calls out a
panga that's you cool you are a panger
family name apanga name Philip how does
it feel to have a new identity
it's a little mysterious I feel good
it's a little mysterious not everyone
can change identity as they wish that's
just what interests me because I am so
much we will say we are different it's a
bit exceptional
all is good you have understood do not
forget your new identity
as from today you shall be called a
panga yes sir
if we do not like the candidate if he
doesn't meet the requirements what we
require of them it could be sent back
basically he shall not be retained if we
see that his profile is good he
continues with us
changing identity is one of the legion's
tradition Stan becomes Philip Sean comes
Robert and shirt becomes Tony nothing is
decided yet as the days go by tension is
more and more visible
candidates are now subjected to a series
of medical checks the slightest health
problem means immediate expulsion
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
at the end of the test the results are
out
a test which seems easy Sean must do his
utmost to stay in the race just after
nine moves he no longer has strength in
his arms
I am very disappointed in myself
is very comfortable
24 pull-ups he smashes the record under
the Applause of his mates
which is frowned upon by the instructor
the next time you this you all leave
where do you think you are at a show in
the theater
go that way
for stand mission accomplished he passed
the tests with flying colors
I couldn't let go I could hold until my
body gave up it was for me the most
important moment to give my all till my
body has nothing to give
it was the most important for me
Behind These Walls each applicant is
interviewed by a dozen interrogators in
connection with Interpol and the world's
police
everything has been checked the phone
shipped bank accounts social networks
the recruits discover that it's
difficult to hide whatever from the
legion
the reactions of the candidates are
carefully observed their answers are
strictly checked
this shredded interview takes place in
absolute secrecy we are prohibited from
filming
after two hours of questioning Stan
shares his Impressions to a recruit who
hasn't been before the commission
you are not going to openly respond you
will try you won't try to justify
yourself you'll really have limited time
to respond that already plays a lot
since you are being questioned they are
not asking for so much details that said
you have to say just little not much
they succeed in making you doubt they
could give a false information about you
and it is really relevant even though
they succeed in placing doubts
for Stan the dice are rolled
when it is physical work it depends on
us you know you have to run you know
that if it isn't going you have to
insist when it is not up to us it is a
little stressful it's true that it is a
little frustrating to think we are
powerless before what might happen we
don't know on what we will be judged we
don't know how it will be done so we are
a little bit stressed
it is the proclamation of results this
morning
the announcement shall be made by the
head of Center Lieutenant Sebastian
Nawa
Aaron
present
Stan starts to realize that names are
being called and to him the failure
Looms
we remain in position
at your disposal
despite his will and physical qualities
the young gavinis will not be part of
the Foreign Legion
saint for Sean the Scottish his name
isn't called out it is time to leave
you have not been selected to join the
ranks of the Foreign Legion
at the call of your name you will
receive pain
you go home
all these men must resign themselves to
giving up their dreams
the consolation of 40 euros pay per day
since their arrival at obangan
for Stan it is a difficult return to
civilian life the young Japanese regains
his identity
is this your passport
yes okay
here you go
Stan won't get a second chance he will
no longer be able to join the Legion
now we move to the bus come with me
Stan had been preparing mentally and
physically for months failure is Harsh
he will never know why he wasn't
selected
definitively unfit my profile doesn't
suit the needs of the Foreign Legion I
sincerely don't know anything more
well I think that they are the experts
they know if they say my profile doesn't
fit it obviously means it doesn't I
didn't come here like a tourist I came
here because I actually wanted to make a
career I wanted to work here
I wanted to have a place in the Foreign
Legion but now that I am told I am
definitively unfit yes I am disappointed
I could never come back never ever
Stan and the others have no chance to
come for another selection in some cases
for example a minor health issue
candidates can represent themselves

[Music]
from the living pine of the deep south
comes one of our most picturesque and
important agricultural industries
rich in the traditions of the past but
geared to the temple of the present
this industry presents a thrilling
chapter in the story of american
ingenuity and progress
[Music]
from these pines comes the raw product
called gum
the source of gum rosin and spirit of
gum turpentine
these two primary products are called
naval stores
coming from the early use of rosin in
the caulking of ships
and tarring of ropes
the united states produces about 75 of
the total world supply of these
important farm products
all of this comes from a group of eight
southern states
reaching from north carolina to texas
about one half of the entire world's
supply is produced in georgia
throughout the southeast
millions of acres of living pine are
yielding their crop of vital gum
to provide for today and tomorrow
only trees of nine inches in diameter or
larger are worked
working smaller trees would be
unprofitable and unwise
the outer bark of the tree is cut away
with an odd curved instrument called a
hogel
[Music]
when the rough bark is removed
the face is ready for installing tins
the broad axe is used to make a cut
about one half inch in depth
the gutters are then placed
and the tins are sealed with gum
an advanced streak is made to stimulate
production
[Music]
almost immediately the gum begins to run
from the face down the gutters
into the cup
a tree yields on an average of about
seven to eight pounds of crude gum a
year
shipping begins in the early spring and
continues for about nine months or until
late fall
a streak is added each week
about one half inch of wood is cut away
different instruments are used to streak
the trees
the one known as the hack is used for
low faces
[Music]
and the puller is used as the face is
worked up the tree
[Music]
crews of dippers harvest the crude gum
from each tree about every two weeks
during the summer months
this varies up to about four weeks
depending upon weather conditions and
the quality of the trees
following the same route on each
operation these dippers never miss a
tree
when it is not practical to work a face
higher another one is started on the
same tree
when the second face has reached maximum
height
the trees are used for lumber
pulp
cross ties fuel and many other uses
in the meantime
younger ones have been grown to take
their plate
the gum is collected in a dip bucket
[Music]
when the dip buckets are full they are
poured into a barrel on the wagon
[Music]
the filled barrels are carried to the
loading platform
here they are placed on trucks and taken
to the turpentine still
the crude gum is to be separated into
spirits of gum turpentine and gum rosin
by distillation
[Music]
the barrels are emptied into the still
and the gum is heated
[Music]
when the temperature reaches about 212
degrees
the turpentine and water begin to
separate from the crude gulf
distillation continues until the
temperature is more than 300 degrees
water being heavier goes to the bottom
leaving the turpentine on top
the residue is rosin which is released
and strained into vats
a sampling device is placed in each drum
and the hot liquid rosin is then dipped
into these drums to solidify
[Music]
these containers are then carried to
huge storage yards
these heavy drums weighing more than 500
pounds are unloaded with ease
[Music]
at the storage yard each drum is
carefully weighed
the rosin sample is then removed
[Music]
a trained inspector matches its color
with the official standard types
perhaps this is nancy
water white george isaac or mary
the grade and weight is written on each
drum
and this determines the amount to be
paid the producer
out into commerce this farm product goes
to meet vital needs at home and abroad
[Music]
the barrel turpentine is carried from
the still to the warehouse
later it is stored in huge tanks
and then is shipped by tank car to large
industrial users
and to packaging plants
[Music]
when packaged and sealed
the product is ready to be used in
innumerable ways in the household and
elsewhere
one of the principal uses of gum
turpentine
is for thinning paint the magic touch of
paint turns what was just a house into
an attractive home
more valuable more beautiful
and more enduring
floor pollen
insect powder
soaps
why even waxed crayons contain gum
products
plastic wood for mending and repairing
adhesive tape
liniment for sore muscles
camphor and hundreds of other uses
[Music]
turpentine and rosin for the manufacture
of rubber cement
[Music]
axel greece and other lubricants
[Music]
rosin for solder
[Music]
even in the arts
[Music]
for matches and cigarette paper
turpentine for shoe polishes
and rosin for paper sizing and printers
ink making possible our modern press
teamed up with the naval stores industry
science is creating new uses for these
farm products
and improving the older ones
[Music]
yes the living pine of the south
is helping our industry
our business
and our homes to meet today's needs and
to build for a better tomorrow
a tomorrow of better living
you

I want to live till I'm 3,000 years old
I want to be on another planet when I
die I do you think that's realistic I
could spend anywhere between 20 to
$50,000 a year on biohacking here I have
some more supplements how many you know
40 to 60 pills we have signed up for
cryonics when you die when you freeze
yourself yeah the government want you
sick so that you can be controllable
this is anti- organ rejection drug and
it's what like minus 100us 120 today how
will I know if my Skin's burning um
you're going to feel extreme pain all
right I am pooing my
[Applause]
[Music]
pantaloons in this episode of Life
uncovered I'm meeting biohacker Leon
biohackers take a DIY approach to
hacking their own biology in an attempt
to live forever Leon's days are spent
fasting for 22 hours taking huge amounts
of supplements working out and taking
off label prescription pills so I'm
currently in Canary Warf and I'm just
about to meet Leon
biohacking totally interests me I can't
lie it requires a lot of dedication um
and it feels like it could just be a big
waste of time I mean if it's true who
doesn't want to be young forever so I
can totally see the appeal of it my big
question is like is it just all a scam
hello how you doing I'm yeah good nice
to meet you nice to meet you as well
thanks for letting me come yeah of
course show me what it takes to Sure
bioh hat let me uh let me just make you
a Bulletproof Coffee I've heard a lot
about bulletproof coffees but I always
just thought you know what butter and a
coffee yeah know this is my spin on it
this is the green tea powder some
turmeric three different types of
mushrooms yep so why why do this I want
to live forever it's not 180 I want to
live till I'm 3,000 years old I want to
be on another planet when I die do you
think that's realistic definitely you
think you can realistically live forever
the speed of innovation is exponential
at this point every year we're we can't
even keep up anymore what's it taste
like yeah I mean you I I'm getting the
mushrooms for sure yeah yeah very
mushroom I don't think I fully know your
real age compar 36 you're 36 okay so
we're not we're not that different in
age this is my bedroom that's a lot of
oils yeah so these are this for your
face this is no these are to to ingest
how much of an investment is it to have
this level of stuff maybe around 1,000
every 45 to 60 days which is isn't Small
Change it's not some people buy a Gucci
bag I'd like to just keep my health
sleep is by far in a way the best thing
that you can do for your health long
term do you have like a specific
position just for pillow between the
legs to kind of align the spine mean
that's quite comfortable I mean what are
the kind of health benefits of this it's
strictly postural I'll typically just
come out here
my wife and daughter are usually still
sleeping I will do whm Hof breathing I
will show you an example of how I do the
breathing I'll start first and then you
can just kind of jump
in I will tell you it's it is um extreme
ex powerful you can get high from doing
that from all the oxygen this is where I
make my morning coffee so how often are
you fasting then every day except for
the except for Saturday Sunday usually
uh 20 22 hours you know I'll go the
entire day I'll come home eat at 10:
p.m. after the gyms and is that one meal
uh I mean you call it one eating window
are you hungry no not at all it uh you
you get over it all of the supplements
down here basically what I use for you
know when I work out stuff you have your
protein your MCT oil powdered peanut
butter some MinGa powder one of the big
questions isn't it I guess is like is it
all just a money-making scheme I
definitely think that some of it is a
money-making scheme you know people that
know what they're doing like me can
usually avoid you can filter the traps
of that taking the pills is simple you
take them out and you down them and it's
what how many uh between 40 to 60 um and
that does it smells like a pharmacy yeah
it smells bad I'll just I'll put a few
more in there grass-fed beef organs it's
really great I love it isn't the an
argument that your body can only take x
amount of vitamins and it'll just
basically excrete the rest of it yeah
exactly but uh I'm I'm fine with that
happening if part of it is wasted fine
you know there is an argument for some
of these these vitamins that like in
large amounts they do have quite
profound effects do you struggle to
handle the fact that you might die one
day I I would just say that I love my
wife and daughter a lot and I just want
to spend as much time with them as
possible we we have signed up for cionic
as well so cryonics is when you freeze
yourself when you die you're going so
basically suck the blood out of you put
some nitrogen in you freeze you freeze
you it's 120,000 for your full body you
use life insurance okay to fund it so we
take out a million dollars uh on each me
and my wife is it not is it not a bit
weird that this random private company
is going to get a million dollars from
the death of you and your wife with at a
technology that hasn't been proven to
work if you do it you have 50% chance of
it's succeeding right if you don't do it
you have a zero% chance so you're dead
is it relaxing living like this I think
about death a lot I think about all of
these things and it is it can be a bit
exhausting where's the kind of need to
biohack and to live forever conf from my
parents okay yeah my dad uh died at 86
and my mom at 70 my mom from cancer and
uh you know they they didn't trust
doctors you know my mom I felt that her
doctors just didn't do enough to throw
the kitchen sink at it just made me real
bitter in general towards the medical
establishment so
yeah as part of Leon's busy biohacking
routine he takes multiple prescription
pills every day but he doesn't actually
have the conditions the pills are made
for are these prescription prescription
is that legal it is it is it is
completely yeah it's completely so how
are you getting them online pharmacies
legitimate pharmacies in the United
States are you worried about the
prescription drug element of it just in
case no this maybe you take something
you shouldn't and there's a ton of
websites out there I do the research
this is a diabetes drug obviously I
don't have diabetes they've proven
taking this basically reduces all cause
mortality this is just typical
over-the-counter uh allergy medicine
with Loratadine in it Loratadine is one
of the ingredients that can block a
particular cancer Pathway to dofil it's
for your sex uh sex drive but the the
the real benefit of this is again that
it lowers your blood pressure this is a
little bit more controversial this is an
anti- organ rejection drug there is an
anti-aging off Lael use for this so I
take six tablets of this on Sunday
evenings it's some pretty pretty
hardcore stuff isn't it yeah an anti-
organ rejection diabetes are you sure
that like the amalgamation of all of
them together isn't having kind of yeah
there's problematic I'm open with my GP
about it I tell her and she advises me
why aren't the drug companies themselves
saying look you can you know reduce your
chance of cancer by taking this or why
is Big farmer not saying we can make
millions for this because they can't
make billions if you can make millions
you want to make billions they want to
make trillions big Pharma is not here to
help
you so I've just stepped outside of
Leon's house for a second and it is a
bit wild that he's just popping random
prescription pills that cannot be good
for you um and obviously the big
question is like is it worth it is he
now younger as a consequence of doing
these things that's what I want to know
and yeah I'm going to go back inside now
go to the gym with him can you lead me
through a crash course workout yeah I'll
take a 20 there we
go and what time you usually hit in the
gym around 8 800 p.m. so it's the last
thing you do just before you eat exactly
exactly in the future my house is going
to be completely biohacked out I'm going
to have
the gym the pool the steam room and SAA
I'll have a hyperbaric oxygen tank I
have a cryotherapy tank so how much do
you think You' need to set aside to have
a fully biohacked house probably a few
million I'll have a reverse osmosis
water system on my uh on my water tank
so that I'm not bathing in in water that
has fluoride and chemicals in it
government's trying to kill you with but
are you saying that they are consciously
trying to kill people or they're trying
to make people sick if people aren't
sick you don't make money so the
government is absolutely not happy about
people being healthy they want you sick
so that you can be controllable who is
it who's calling these shots the cabal
the michis the Rockefellers the
Rothchilds what has like a coordinated
eff 100% and how would that never make
it out to the outside world it is in the
outside world but you got to realize
there's a class of people out there that
want to be controlled cuz the idea that
there's like a cabal running the world m
that's trying to kill us with fluoride
now water is very qon on that's like a
kind of q q kind of I think most
biohackers are
just they they think it's important to
be able to control their own
outcomes rather than to bury their heads
in the
sand so I've just come out of his place
and and it feels like the kind of
biohacking world is a place that has
quite a lot of people who are quite
distrusting of mainstream medicine so
tomorrow I'm going to see another
element of his world he's getting some
kind of facial then we're going to a
cryogenic lab um to be frozen I've never
done that before I'm a little bit you
know worried about
it how you do how you doing man good to
see looking beautiful oh yeah thank you
yeah know I just just came from a hydro
facial you look you're glowing
absolutely glowing so what what's
happening today so I know we've got a
whole day of treatments us yeah so we're
going to go to uh my favorite biohacking
Clinic it's called human so there's
actually something called a biohacking
clinic that's like a thing yeah yeah
that's what that's what we call it I'm
intrigued I'm excited excited nervous
should we all right head off let's head
off let's
go hey great Le good to see you how are
you pleasure to meet you Ben nice to
meet you call you doct e please that
sounds like something from a Sci-Fi
doesn't it well I think we are it does
feel like we're in a Sci-Fi yet is this
a place so if I wanted to live forever
would this be a place I come to is that
like a realistic ambition living
stronger for longer is one of our manes
should we uh check out some of the other
therapist sure why the hell not shall we
do ozone therapy yeah go for it so
what's going on here then ozone is three
particles of oxygen o03 ozone therapy is
delivery of ozone mixing it with his
blood and putting that back into his
system increases the levels of
antioxidants so is this now going back
into his blood yeah correct yeah yeah
what what of the more unexpected
elements of it for me is the kind of use
of the part the kind of prescription
drugs for off label purposes what do you
think of that I don't use the
medication
myself uh for my patients would you
recommend it to a client um we're not
currently I guess there is a worry that
maybe having a lot of that drug over a
long period of time could have uning
consequences yeah I mean consequences
will come if they're going to come and
they won't if they're not so only time
will tell this is our cryotherapy Suite
we're going to get you started in a in a
second is there an advantage over this
to just have a nice bath absolutely yes
because your head goes in as well so um
and you go to a lower temperature and
it's what like
minus- 120 today stay in for how long
like 3 minutes 3 minutes okay why 3
minutes three the door is not locked
because after that you will get burn
your your skin will burn yeah from the
cold from the cold okay how will I know
if my skin is
burning um you're going to feel extreme
pain all
right so we've got some kit for you here
so gloves socks thermal socks under your
knees air boots I'm a little bit I'm a
little bit worried no you're fine all
right let's let's fire it up I am pooing
my
pantaloons this is going to be
terrifying it's like a portal to another
horrible Universe isn't it should we
start yeah right we'll start from there
you see the clock there yeah
okay nice deep breaths you're going to
see him disappear nice control
breathing oh my God he just disappeared
he looks like he's absolutely freezing
he nice control breathing is good
yeah well done brother any words of
advice get outside your mind oh God oh
God okay you ready
let's go no but I'll do it you're up
brother good
luck nice deep breathing you got
this okay Ben you're entering the last
60 seconds you really well nice control
breathing control your biology
lift yourk
down that is pretty chilly that is
chilly I can't Li you feeling good all
good you do smashed it
okay
nice oh God man 110° first time when it
was good I feel good yeah you feel good
I feel alive for sure I can't lie it's a
pretty meditative
experience there you go I'm now going to
live forever that's it despite a long
day at the clinic I was still skeptical
about whether this was really making any
difference it felt like it could all
just be a bit of a waste of time and
money so I had an idea I sent Leon
what's called an epigenetic blood test
the results would be able to tell us the
difference between his real
chronological age and and his biological
age meaning how old his cells are I've
never done one before we're going to see
how old I actually am I took the test as
well so that we could compare the
results I'm trying to figure out how to
hold it biohacker vers non-
biohacker a couple of months later it
was time to meet again but I noticed he
looked a little bit different good to
see you you're significantly Browner
than when I last saw you yeah I uh been
using a peptide and it up regates the
melanin in your skin for for men it like
just really increases I guess the
verality of your sexual function I don't
know what you call it but like by
exactly exactly so that's like one of
the uses and then the tanning is the
other one so you kind of get both
together and it's just so you're taking
it to both increase your sexual appetite
personally I was just curious I had
never taken it before and I wanted to
see what it does I actually I don't like
it you know so much because it was too
powerful you're you're having like these
really uncomfortable moments on the
train stoning erection it's just
ridiculous you know so I'm probably
going to be laying off of it for for a
while I I'm not even doing it anymore
cuz I'm too dark already great I'm I'm
excited today for this yeah me
too Dr E how you doing Dr E pleasure to
see you so you you are a pro biohacker I
am not necessarily A biohacker we're
going to see whose biological age is
younger do you actively yeah think about
this stuff well I spend a lot of time in
the bathroom sticking myself with
needles in a stomach basically what do
you think of that the things that we're
injecting into us we need to be very
very careful about there could be side
effects and that's a risk that you're
kind of consciously taking you know I
genuinely as a doctor who came into this
space to make things better it concerns
me is it worth it cuz ultimately you're
doing it cuz you want a long life aren't
you so what if what if the consequence
is the exact opposite I mean at the end
of the day like I could walk out of here
and get hit by a bus or I could just not
do anything and live as long as I would
or I I would say that there's a lot of
people that don't do any research I do
as much as possible all right I'll let
you guys choose for
yourself okay you go first okay there we
go moment two
trat
wow I can't even find the page to I'm 20
no
wait I'm also
20 what the so technically that means
that I won because I'm older than you my
biological age is 12 years younger yours
is 16 years younger wow amazing what oh
perfect but Ben is impressive you put up
a good fight know right fair enough I'll
take it impressive because he's not a
biohacker so that means his genetics are
really good is the effort worth four
years of biological aging maybe for Leon
if he didn't do this these all these
things where would he that's the
question to ask right it's hard to know
um for sure what did you make of Dr E's
kind of final I suppose subtle warning
of don't take too many things kind have
a negative I agree I agree and and I'm
very careful I'm not mixing my own
testosterone on my stove at home I'm I'm
as safe as you can be as a pedestrian in
the space basically so okay so I might
have sadly lost the biological boxing
match but I take victory in the fact
that you know I don't spend hours doing
this I haven't spent thousands of pounds
and I think in reality this journey
hasn't made me want to do what Leon does
he's taking a lot of risks and I
understand why he's doing it he wants to
live for a long time he wants to be
there for his family and I think he's a
nice guy I understand why Leon wants to
live longer in truth so do I but a lot
of what he's doing is unregulated and
risky and with so much of his life
consumed by prolonging the future is he
really living right
[Music]
now

Just try! I'll get you my pretty 
-- and your little dog, too.
Can you even have a great 
movie without a great villain?
...Okay, maybe you can, but 
it's not nearly as much fun.
I'm sending it back to hell where it belongs.
Were you in love with her beast?
And that's true even for non-Disney movies.
Human beings define their reality 
through misery and suffering.
Is this your king?
I'm your number one fan.
I won't touch Barton. Not until i 
make him kill you. Slowly. Intimately.
So it's no surprise that when a thousand 
film industry pros were asked about the  
greatest villain of all time their 
choice was Emperor Palp-- wait...
Good morning.
He's not even on the list??
Fools! Idiots! Imbeciles!!
Could they really not find space for a villain 
who emerged from across the gulf of time --
to settle an epic grudge --
hiding in plain sight --
until he could twist the hero of 
the movie into his personal pawn --
in order to enslave the universe to his will?
What exactly is being overlooked here?
Is it the scope of palpatine's plan
Because after, all a villain 
is only as good as his plan.
Do I really look like a guy with a plan?
By the time of the Phantom 
Menace the -- uh, phantom menace
is about to execute the next step in his 
plan to take full control of the galaxy
and no one has any idea.
They're all way too focused on the 
political process to see Palpatine's  
scheme unfolding right before their eyes --
Oh hey, maybe they could start a YouTube channel!
So his evil scheme... is he really 
wants Queen Amidala to sign a paper.
I have never known the plot of this movie until 
now, after having watched this movie for 20 years.
Okay... I don't get it
Imbeciles!!
Unfortunately, Palpatine isn't the 
type to just drop out of the sky  
and announce his plan to destroy civilization:
"You are about to die at the 
hands of the children of Thanos."
Why should he? He's got the 
Republic exactly where he wants it
and the Jedi think the Sith's return is --
"Impossible. The Sith have 
been extinct for a millennium."
A millennium is a long time 
to be planning revenge.
That would be like if the descendants of Genghis 
Khan came back now to take revenge on... Russia?
When the Sith went extinct, it was clearly at 
the hands of a dangerous capable Jedi order
and it sounds like whatever happened then 
is part of what created the Republic:
"This republic has stood for a thousand years..."
That's why the Jedi seem so confident.
And yet the Sith seem pretty 
sure of themselves, too...
"At last we will reveal ourselves to 
the Jedi. At last we will have revenge."
That's because the Jedi order has lost a step.
Now they're just an inflexible hierarchy making 
arbitrary decisions from a literal ivory tower.
"The Force is strong with him."
"He is to be trained then?" 
"No. He will not be trained."
Whatever they were before, there's 
little more than a ghost left of it now.
As Dave Filoni says, this sense that 
the Jedi have lost their mission  
is what makes Qui-gon's death so tragic.
"What's at stake is really 
how Anakin's gonna turn out
because Qui-gon is different than the rest 
of the Jedi and you get that in the movie
and Qui-gon is fighting because he 
knows he's the father that Anakin needs
but instead of that father, Anakin gets this one
"The Chosen One the boy may be,  
but agree with your taking this boy 
as your Padawan learner I do not."
"The rest of the Jedi are so detached 
and they've become so political
that they've really lost their way
and Yoda starts to see that in the second 
film but Qui-gon is ahead of them all
that's a failing for Anakin
he doesn't have the the family that he 
needs so he's left completely vulnerable.
"What will happen to me now?"
Palpatine steps into that 
role of guidance for Anakin
filling his head with a very 
different idea of destiny:
"You are the most gifted Jedi I have ever met. 
I see you becoming the greatest of all Jedi."
"I will be the most powerful Jedi ever."
And since Anakin's relationships 
grow increasingly strained,  
both with the Jedi Council and with Obi-wan
Palpatine is the only person who 
truly believes in Anakin's potential
"They've finally given you an 
assignment. Your patience has paid off."
In fact, he's essentially the only person from the 
entire Republic who's ever shown him any support.
"The republic's anti-slavery laws--"
"The Republic doesn't exist out here."
In many ways the Prequels are 
the story of an arrogant religion
who get a hold of the messiah and then 
accidentally hand him over to the devil.
The war doesn't go well, either.
What we get to see of the 
Clone Wars... is pretty sick.
There's a reason people wanted more of it.
Like a lot more of it
This is a really good show, by the way. 
I wonder why it's so -- oh that's right.
But for the story Lucas was telling, 
the only things that really matter  
about the Clone Wars are how 
they begin and how they end.
That's certainly all that matters to Palpatine.
You know the funny thing about this promise?
"I will not let this republic be split in two."
He kept it.
There were never two sides to the war
Of course it looks like you have 
Dooku and the Separatists and Grievous
versus the Jedi and the clones and the Republic,
but the reality is, all of these 
people are fighting for the same guy.
It was a proxy war. It was a sham.
A manufactured crisis that made 
hypocrites out of the Jedi:
"We're keepers of the peace not soldiers."
Destabilized planets across the galaxy:
"We are being held hostage"
And extended the range of Palpatine's control.
Listen to the music here:
This is the birth of the Empire
This is why Palpatine plunged 
the galaxy into the fog of war  
and made peacekeepers forget their purpose.
Politics.
And the Jedi just stood by and watched -- 
seemingly ignorant of the real game being played.
They totally missed the importance of -- uh wait 
it's here somewhere -- oh yeah: The Chosen One.
The Jedi's fate is inextricably 
connected to Anakin's,  
and who is the only person he trusts? Not them.
"My trust in them has been shaken."
But they don't see this. They 
don't see a lot of things.
They kind of look like idiots honestly.
"Chancellor Palpatine Sith 
lords are our specialty."
They don't notice when Palpatine uses 
Anakin to siphon their power away.
And when they finally discover the truth, 
they rush in in a very unjedi-like manner.
They just assume that it's gonna go the 
same way it did a thousand years ago.
And the Jedi council's rejection of Anakin.
"You're on this council, but we do 
not grant you the rank of master."
Comes back to haunt them.
When Palpatine activates Order 66
the Jedi who scoffed at the idea of 
the Sith's returning from extinction  
are annihilated in a matter of minutes
most of them never knowing how 
deep their failure truly went.
And now the path was clear for Palpatine to 
become emperor "with thunderous applause."
He promises the galaxy:
Although we get to see the fates of those who 
Palpatine previously promised security to.
"Lord Sidious promised us peace!"
Palpatine's final victory is 
almost unmatched in its scope
Revenge of the Sith is like a 
renaissance painting of judgment day
where the Republic's political and 
spiritual powers crumble into nothing
and its hero tries to murder his wife, 
before crossing swords with his brother,  
and being consumed by wrath
and when it's all over Palpatine swoops 
into hell like the angel of death
and Darth Vader is born
as the last person in the galaxy who still 
believes he has any good in him dies.
Who is Palpatine's competition exactly?
Satan?
Because that's basically who Palpatine is.
He dragged the most promising 
Jedi down to the fires of hell
returning him to the state 
of slavery he was born in
as a machine with a skull 
where his face used to be.
"And I'm telling you this 
finale it's unbelievable.
How tepid contemporary art seemed compared 
to the passionate quality of this finale.
So you have this like huge 
like romantic nature painting
the apocalyptic landscape of the lava.
Then Lucas cross cuts to the 
destruction of the senate chamber
and you have the destruction of industry going on
and then after all these 
horrors -- it is so beautiful
I'm saying my god!
Nothing in the last thirty years in 
any of the arts has been produced,  
as emotionally compelling and significant
as the finale of Revenge of the Sith."
In other words the only thing that 
eclipses the scope of Palpatine's villainy  
is the scope of Star Wars itself.

how is it that a country that was a poor
British colonial outpost and has a small
population limited land space and no
natural resources has become one of the
most developed countries in the world in
a little over 50 years that country is
Singapore
Singapore is in Southeast Asia just off
the south coast of Malaysia and at the
heart of the fastest developing
continent in the world
the history of modern Singapore goes
back to 1819 when Sir Stamford Raffles
landed upon its shores he was on an
expedition on behalf of the British East
India Company to establish a new base in
the region
he still recognized even to this day the
shopping center an office block and a
hotel named in his honor what followed
was a hundred and twenty years of
British rule the remnants of this can
still be seen in the colonial district
during world war ii singapore fell into
the hands of the japanese and three and
a half years of brutal rule followed the
kranji war memorial is a reminder of
those who lost their lives
in May 1959 Singapore achieved full
independence under the prime
ministership of Lee Kuan Yew the role
that would remain his for the next
thirty years his vision was of a country
with a strong economy despite no natural
resources and a multicultural embracing
society a policy of keeping the local
population happy while attracting
foreign workers with different skill
sets is what has made Singapore the
success it is today Singaporeans have a
strong work ethic which is possibly down
to their troubled history and how they
have had to overcome adversities such as
colonial ownership and Japanese
occupation the population is made up
predominantly of Chinese Indians
and malaise the diversity of these
peoples can be seen in their respective
areas Chinatown Little India and the
Arab quarter and it well illustrates how
these different nationalities work
side-by-side with each other
Ahmed is a Singaporean taxi driver who
typifies the spirit of the population
actually I was born in Singapore in 1915
to Singapore 1050 was under the British
colony to be a taxi trouble in my part
I've been driving taxi for Passover
anything is I can say that I've been
working every day as a taxi driver so
whenever I feel I fired I just go back
home and take a short break so I play
possibly about then about 11 of us every
day but it's enjoyed to be a taxi driver
because you know your job what you are
doing to serve the people even though we
get that different people one but when
you live here we are in one no get in
one whatever we do yeah we live here
actually it is been a very good harmony
you know where we don't find trouble
after one another is a day so we like to
live in peace in Singapore I really
happy to live here is a good and fine
country as I can see then I thanks to
God and I was selected to live in
Singapore this is what all my design
one of these achievements which helped
Singapore rise to the economic success
it is now was the creation of the
Economic Development Board an agency
designed to encourage business and
foreign investment hi my name is
contraction
I'm the assistant managing director of
EDB EDP is the economic development
board of Singapore we are government
agency responsible for developing
Singapore's industry industry such as
electronics chemicals biomedical
industry we also are responsible for
attracting and helping international
companies set up their regional
headquarters Asian equities in single
the only resource we have is our people
and our people have been diligently in
that working they understand the
challenges that Singapore have to face
and they rise to the challenge
already over this period of a few
decades our people upgraded their
schemes we are very clear that economic
growth is very important when you have
economic growth you can solve many of
your other problems especially social
problems so I would believe is that you
if you have good economic growth you
will have they're good jobs for people
to grow faster than we are able to we
just have to be open to
having as many people as possible
contribute to disco
this means making sure first our room
people at the right skills the right
knowledge the right training the right
opportunities but that is upper limit
and when we reach the upper limit we
still wanna grow beyond that then we
must have on what we call international
talent people who have the right skills
where the right connections who also
believe in the Singapore story is a
welcome come and take part in this
school we will make it worth your while
for you you will have to do your part
but and so far this formula as well and
we have also noticed in this globalized
world we are not only please doing this
many many other cities are doing very
well by being very very open to
globalization
a sign of the EDB success in creating
opportunities for foreign workers is
Ravi tatran an Indian born businessman
who is the group president of the Louis
Vuitton mo a Hennessy organization well
I've been working in Singapore for about
13 years
however the continuous phase here was
eight years I had a in-between blip I
went to Shanghai and came back again the
Singapore has been most exciting part of
her journey foreign workers when they
come to Singapore they bring a variety
of things and what one is obviously the
cultural aspect itself beside that they
know the knowledge of markets so
knowledge of economies whether in East
like Japan Korea Taiwan China or unto
the west which is you know US Europe and
even mark allegation Middle East is very
vital it's one place where people are
extremely hardworking that is something
I think whole of Europe could take from
a place like Singapore this this nation
basically it is got a drive that we got
to cover up for few missed generations
we got to really achieve all that we
missed out on and when the whole nation
is pushing the wall together and to get
ahead every single day in life I think
it does create a phenomenal amount of
energy

Britain and France are routinely
condemned for their appeasement of
Hitler and Mussolini in the years
leading up to the second world war they
saw Britain and France too little to
combat growing Italian and German
aggression during the mid to late 1930s
it's argued that appeasement allowed the
two fascist powers to grow in strength
for made World War two inevitable
furthermore it's also said that it
needlessly condemned millions of
Europeans to live under regimes that
they did not want to the big question is
did appeasement actually work and
achieve what the Allies wanted before
continuing it's very important to note
that the governments of France and the
UK weren't free to take his harder line
as they wanted to their respective
populations were fiercely against any
future war in Britain specifically was
suffering from economic malaise which
was combined with the simple fact its
power was now waning relative to Germany
as such both nations had militaries
which were underfunded and fixing their
problems would take many years so the
first major act of appeasement came when
Hitler publicly announced the
reintroduction of conscription in 1935
which had been forbidden in the Treaty
of Versailles the British prime minister
Ramsay MacDonald didn't want to denounce
the German decision lest they withdraw
from talks over limiting the size of
their Navy the next problem came with
the Italian War and subsequent conquest
of Ethiopia was Britain didn't want a
stronger Italian Empire they realized
that militarily they weren't able to do
much about it France took the lead here
and pressured Britain not to pursue too
strong a response
France is thinking here was that if
Italy felt too isolated it would turn to
Germany for an alliance and that
couldn't be allowed in early 1936
Germany Rhee militarized the Rhineland
meaning that it's stationed troops there
which was something also forbidden by
the Treaty of Versailles the French had
a larger and more capable army at this
point and could have quite easily
defeated the German troops there but
political problems at home stopped any
interference Europe was pretty quiet for
a couple of years until early 1938 when
Germany annexed Austria and Hitler
subsequently turned his attention to
Czechoslovakia specifically this land
the Sudetenland which was populated
mostly by ethnic Germans and which
Hitler then demanded be given to him the
British in the French were in a bit of a
conundrum here because they wanted to
guarantee the independence of
Czechoslovakia but they also knew that
military intervention wouldn't have
stopped Germany from conquering it as
such the Munich conference was held
which saw British Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain Mussolini Hitler and the
French prime minister
Eduardo Xavier come to an agreement it
was decided that Czechoslovakia would
cede the Sudetenland that Germany would
promised not to conquer the rest of it
until it did in March of 1939
the reason for throwing Czechoslovakia
to the Germans was that both France and
Britain knew that militarily they
weren't able to fight yet you see the
Allies weren't fools they didn't believe
that one day Hitler would be happy and
stop eating countries they simply knew
that some would have to be sacrificed to
buy them time to rearm when Italy
invaded and conquered Albania in April
of 1939 the French decided that there
could be no more appeasement instead a
pre-emptive war would be necessary to
protect Greece and contain Mussolini and
went alladia brought his plan to the
British their response was agreement
just kidding more appeasement in fact
Chamberlain asked France to consider
ceding colonial territory to the
Italians in order to placate Mussolini
and tried to dissuade him from joining
Germany in the war France said no to
this in both allies largely accepted
that a war with Germany would mean a war
with Italy at this point of course
appeasement couldn't last forever and
when Poland with British and French
guarantees refused to cede territory to
Germany it did the Second World War
kicked off and to many this is proof
that appeasement failed miserably this
assumes that appeasement was meant to
prevent war which was not the Allies
intention it was supposed to allow
Britain and France to rearm which they
both did British defense spending rose
rapidly during the five years leading up
to the war with the government spending
40% of the national budget on defense
after disa debt and land crisis and as
for France they used the time to
massively increase naval spending there
was however one major flaw in
sacrificing other countries to allow for
more time to rearm it allowed germany in
italy to continue their military buildup
and frankly these two use their time
much more effectively than either France
or Britain did I hope you enjoyed this

[Music]
films are made up of sequences sequences
are made up of scenes
and scenes are made up of shots
in previous episodes we covered camera
lenses frame rates
discombobulate
and scene transitions
[Music]
today we're going to look at another
angle of editing by examining different
ways we can cut within the scene
this is episode 10
of the shot list
editing techniques
almost all of an editor's work comes
down to three choices what to show
when to cut
and what to cut to
what the
the cut itself is the most basic way to
move from shot to shot
and when an editor cuts away from the
main action it's referred to as a
cutaway
[Music]
give
famed editor walter merch laid out his
rule of six
a list to prioritize criteria when
deciding on each cut how we pace a scene
can affect emotion style and tone
is your scene mournful and contemplative
hold on shots for longer hello darkness
my old friend
i've come to talk with you again
is your scene filled with frantic action
rapid cutting might be an order
deciding what to cut to is equally
important an editor might use a cutaway
to indicate what's on a character's mind
[Music]
or cut to what a character is looking at
no matter the reason every edit should
be thoughtful and purposeful
for a detailed explanation on the rule
of six you'll find a link to our blog in
the description
this brings us to our first editing
fundamental
eyeline
an eyeline match is when an editor cuts
to the object of a character's attention
[Music]
if a character notices something we cut
to what they see the second shot is
often a literal pov shot or from that
character's general perspective
this is such common practice that we can
build intrigue by either waiting to
reveal what they see
fran doyle back to the ranger now
or by not showing it at all
we happy
vincent
we happy yeah we happy
either way it's the characters eyes that
motivate the cut
consider this moment from 300. choose
your next words carefully leonidas
they may be your last as king
as king leonidas debates whether to
submit to xerxes control watch how his
eyes guide the edit
with each glance we cut to his land
his citizens
his wife
and in this process we are invited to
think like leonidas
will he sacrifices people's freedom or
not
a common form of the isline match is the
shot reverse shot when we cut between a
shot of subject a and a shot of subject
b in a reverse angle that is often a
similar angle and composition
the most common use of this can be found
in conversation scenes to maintain scene
geography and clarity
inserts are also often prompted by
eyeline matches an insert is a shot of a
detail within a scene
usually in order to emphasize a specific
prop or element
in tenet the protagonist looks off
camera and we cut to this insert an
example of simple and direct visual
language
the eyeline match is a great way to
connect the dots between what the
character sees
thinks or feels
impressive
very nice
it can also create and release tension
depending on what we see and when we see
it
[Music]
[Music]
george
george
hi george
what's going on
instead of cutting between two objects
in the same scene our next technique
cuts between separate scenes
cross cutting
cross-cutting is when an editor cuts
between two or more scenes happening in
different locations usually at the same
time
the baptism sequence from the godfather
alternates between michael renouncing
evil
michael francis ritzy do you renounce
satan
and his men following michael's orders
to execute his rivals
by crosscutting these scenes it creates
an ironic juxtaposition that elevates
the entire sequence
in all his works
[Music]
[Applause]
i do announce them
but cross-cutting can also be an
effective way to combine multi-layered
action as well
in rogue one the last third of the
entire film is a massive sequence
comprised of three distinct battlefronts
the combat on the beach
the dogfight in space
and the covert operation to steal the
death star plans
[Music]
in fact each of these fronts split into
additional subplots
but by alternating between these scenes
the crosscutting helps keep the plot and
action constantly moving forward
and the audience invested in each
group's progress
crosscutting can create parallels
between separate scenes that wouldn't be
there otherwise and weave multiple
planes of action in one
now let's look at a technique which is
designed to keep the audience's
attention fixed to a specific part of
the frame
itrace
itrace is when an editor cuts between
two or more shots that focus on the same
area of the frame
this allows the viewer's eyes and
attention to stay focused without having
to scan the frame after each cut
welcome school
[Music]
itrace can also be used through blocking
and camera movement
guiding a viewer's eye within a shot
[Applause]
but let's look at how editors can
achieve a similar effect
itrace is ideal for action scenes which
tend to move quickly
mad max fury road makes heavy use of
this technique here's dp john seal
explaining this decision
compositionally
whatever was the center point of that
shot had to be in the center of frame
in the faster cutting that he's got your
eye won't have to shift on an anamorphic
frame to find the next subject when
you've only got
1.8 seconds of time to do that
all we would hear all the time on the
comms was george saying put the
crosshairs on her nose put the cross
hairs on her nose
and that is basically the whole film
some shots in the film are less than a
second long
using eye trace the composition and
editing of these scenes helps the viewer
process even the most chaotic action
our next type of cut also helps smooth
over a transition
split edits
while a hard cut changes both audio and
video at the same time
[Music]
a split edit changes either the sound or
image before the other this is either a
j cut
or an l cut
they get their names from what they look
like in an editing timeline
a j-cut is when audio from a shot begins
to play before we see it
excuse me
is that your car in the lot yeah
that's a nice ride thanks man connie's
off hey jordan belfort nice to meet you
for an l cut the audio from a shot plays
after we've already cut away
happy birthday
hey bonnie we'll get you back to your
daddy in a day or two don't be sad oh
that's good you're not sad are you happy
paw
paw
no paw that's okay too
the technique is often used during
dialogue scenes
allowing editors to create a more
natural conversation control the rhythm
of dialogue as well as catching reaction
shots of someone listening
you know what animal jokes well i only
got the chance to say one because we
only did one show
tell me
it's corny
don't be that way tell me
no you wouldn't like it and i'd be
embarrassed
you've been you told like 50 million
people
and you can't tell me
i promise i won't laugh
but there are more creative ways to use
a j or l cut for example when characters
outline a plan like in mission
impossible rogue nation
so why hasn't lane just sent someone to
steal it
oh he has
he sent
me and i can tell you
it's impossible
to reach the terminal you'll need to
pass the main gate
we use an l cut to show the security
measures they mention
and open three separate combination
locks
well that's easy we just impersonate the
agent who stole the ledger in the first
place i get to wear a mask
this makes their plan more clear to the
audience
especially when it eventually goes wrong
okay i don't get to wear a mask seeing
the plan in action is more visually
interesting than simply hearing it and
additional j and l cuts within their
dialogue ensures the sequence moves
swiftly
but what if we want to make a cut more
noticeable not less intellectual montage
[Music]
intellectual montage puts seemingly
unrelated images together in order to
create a certain feeling or idea
this type of montage makes use of the
kuleshov effect which refers to creating
meaning out of a cinematic juxtaposition
we take this man's expression to mean
different things based on the image
intercut with him
in this scene from lucy as her boyfriend
tries to convince her to deliver a
briefcase i can't deliver the case
myself i had a little falling out with
the guy it's nothing major but if it's
you problem solve
we get this shot
look you can even see the reception from
here
two separate scenes combine to create a
single idea she is walking into a trap
i'm here for uh
mr jane as the scene plays out we get
another series of juxtaposing imagery
is being stalked
unaware of just how much danger she is
in
in don't look up intellectual montage is
used to emphasize the global scale of an
impending disaster a comet is going to
wipe out life on earth
[Music]
we're all 100 for sure gonna die
but randall and kate's warning is
falling on deaf ears then we get this
series of shots
[Music]
[Applause]
you're gonna die you're gonna die
isolated these shots would have a
neutral connotation
but placed in this context we are asked
to make the connections ourselves
from massive cityscapes to microscopic
organisms
everything will be affected by the
impending disaster
by using intellectual montage director
adam mckay is able to visually reiterate
larger themes in the film
this experimental technique is a great
way to evoke emotion and meaning out of
shots that individually wouldn't have
them
moving on to our final technique
cut on action
[Music]
cutting on action refers to cutting
during a character or object's movement
when the out point of shot a corresponds
directly to the in point of shot b
it creates a more seamless transition
[Music]
this technique can be used for simple
actions like taking a drink
or shaking hands
most editors working in any genre will
use cutting on action to create smoother
cuts that feel more natural to the
audience
and it is often found in fight scenes
because it lends itself to fast-paced
rhythm and quick movement
like the fight between neo and morpheus
in the matrix resurrections
a very common cut on action in fight
sequences is to cut on impact this gives
each punch and kick extra force
notice how the cuts in this fight are
placed in the middle of one character's
move
punching in from a wide to a dramatic
close-up
by cutting on action throughout this
scene director lana wachowski is able to
keep up the pace
strengthen the stunts and create a more
epic feeling to the fight
[Music]
so
these are the six essential ways editors
use the cut
but we haven't covered everything
there are also freeze frames
invisible cuts
subliminal frames
[Music]
double cuts

1918 in the first world war is finally
over as punishment for losing Germany's
two wartime allies the austro-hungarian
and ottoman Empires were carved up
shortly afterwards the pressures of
defeat plunged Germany into chaos and as
a result the Kaiser abdicated Revolution
and counter-revolution were the order of
the day and in the small town of Weimar
Berlin was too dangerous the Weimar
Republic was declared the next year the
Allies signed the Treaty of Versailles
which dictated the terms of Allied
Victory this territory was lost and the
Rhineland was occupied by the Allies
Germany further had to reduce its
military massively pay War reparations
and also had to accept almost full
responsibility for the war's outbreak so
this new Weimar Republic is one of the
most democratic nations in the world at
that point suffrage was granted to
everyone over the age of 20 including
women the German people could vote on
two aspects of the national government
every seven years they voted on a
president who presided over the German
Parliament the reichstag every four
years people would vote for political
parties in national elections for the
reichstag virus system known as
proportional representation whereby the
percentage of votes nationally dictated
percentage of seats in the reichstag the
president could call elections whenever
he felt and also had the important job
of appointing the chancellor who ran the
government and could proposed laws these
laws had to be passed by a majority vote
in the reichstag and since no party ever
got 50 of the seat that meant the
parties would have to cooperate no
democracy did not guarantee Harmony and
there was numerous attempts at
revolutions such as the quickly aborted
Socialist Republic of Bavaria and the
1920 Revolution led by Dr Wolfgang cap
seized Berlin and the German Army
refused to attack him because there was
a strong belief that Germany had only
lost the war due to political betrayal
Cap's Revolution was only ended by a
general strike which crowned the country
to a halt this turmoil did not help the
German economy and eventually Germany
missed a war payment the French wished
to punish the Germans for this whereas
the British wanted leniency the French
government decided that if the Germans
would not pay them then they'd simply
take the money instead and in 1923 the
French occupied the heavily
industrialized region of the rur the
reason for this was that German
reparations could be paid in raw
materials many of which were produced
there another way that German
reparations could be paid was in foreign
currencies which were paid for by
printing more paper marks this created
the hyperinflation that the Weimar
Republic is famous for for example in
January 1923 a loaf of bread cost 163
marks and in early November in 1923 the
same loaf of bread cost over 75 billion
marks in November 1923 another attempted
revolution occurred in Munich led by a
certain Adolf Hitler and undertaken by
the sa the military arm of the National
Socialist German Workers Party better
known as the Nazi party this revolution
failed when other nationalist
politicians refused to help Hitler and
the Army was called in Hitler was
wounded and arrested shortly afterwards
it was imprisoned that Hitler dictated
his autobiography Mein Kampf which
became the Bedrock of Nazi ideology all
of this would make it seem like the
Weimar Republic was about to immediately
collapse but it managed to survive
thanks to the intervention of two
specific individuals Gustav strasserman
who helped to repair relations with
France and Charles Dawes an American who
would later become vice president who
helped to relieve some of Germany's
economic problems Germany's repayments
were lowered the French agreed to leave
the and America agreed to loan Germany
money which created a strong economic
leap between the two countries so then
the Great Depression struck tanking the
U.S economy and dragging Germany's down
with it Paul Von Hindenburg the
president of Germany at the time failed
to get the reichstag to agree on a
response or anything as a result he had
to invoke article 48 which allowed the
president to pass laws without the
approval of the reichstag in times of
Emergency the biggest problem with
article 48 was that there was no
definition of an emergency meaning it
was open to abuse the German people
turned to different political parties to
fix the problems some chose communism
whereas others placed their faith in the
National socialists the Nazis believed
that the german-speaking peoples should
be United in a single state they argued
that Communists and the Jews were the
enemies of the German people and as such
had to be removed the Nazis were popular
because they wished to disregard the
Treaty of Versailles which many Germans
considered insulting they also wish to
limit any foreign involvement in German
Affairs by limiting the rights and
numbers of foreigners in Germany another
reason was people's anger with the
continuing economic crises which they
were desperate to end a series of
Elections led to a massive increase in
in the number of seats held by the Nazis
and by 1932 they were the largest Party
by far after continuously coming first
Hitler asked president hinderberg to be
made Chancellor which he refused several
times because they were worried that
Hitler would overthrow the government
yet eventually after the Nazis
continuous victories and elections
Hindenburg agreed to give him the job in
January 1933. so Hitler immediately
began working to overthrow the
government a fire started in the
reichstag by a young Dutch communist was
used by Hitler to paint all Communists
as the enemies of Germany Hindenburg
under pressure from Hitler issued the
reichstag fire decree and the reichstag
passed the enabling act which suspended
many civil liberties and made Hitler the
de facto dictator of Germany these were
passed mainly because the opposing
communist parties were outlawed and that
the vote was being held in a building
filled with armed members of the sa over
the next few months Hitler established
the secret police the Gestapo in order
to help Shore up his position he
outlawed trade unions as they were seen
as breeding grounds for Communists and
in July he abolished all other political
parties in 1934 Hitler ordered the SS
another paramilitary group and the
Gestapo to eliminate his enemies which
included the head of the sa Ernst room
in an event known as the night of the
Long Knives this was mainly because
Hitler felt that the essay was the only
force that could stop him shortly after
this purge president Hindenburg died and
Hitler assumed the role of President as
well as that of the chancellor he
declared himself the fuhrer of Germany
and using article 48 create a
single-party dictatorship the lives of
Germans changed massively under the new
Nazi regime the media was brought under
the control of Joseph Goebbels the
minister for propaganda Heinrich Himmler
was placed in command of the gestapo and
the SS who were ordered to crack down on
anyone who disagreed with the Nazi
government Germans for the most part
accepted having less freedoms in return
for a higher standard of living and
because the Nazis had ended the chaos
from the decade before they took power
the Nazi government established the
German labor front which was like a
trade Union except without the
representation the Nazis also
established the strength through Joy
program which was designed to keep
workers happy it even helped to produce
class barriers by making vacations clubs
Cinemas and other recreational
activities open to people outside of the
upper classes its most popular creation
was the people's car better known as the
Volkswagen which further which the class
divide since it could be paid for in
installments in 1936 Hermann Gering was
put in charge of the economy beginning
the four-year plan which was supposed to
make Germany entirely self-sufficient
within four years unemployment virtually
disappeared conscription was instated a
major public works were undertaken most
famously the Autobahn and the Berlin
Olympic Games the most important part of
the four-year plan was that it saw the
beginning of German rearmament which was
a violation of the Treaty of Versailles
Hitler's plan to unify the German people
picked up towards the end of the 30s in
1938 after some double dealing threat
and the referendum German troops March
into Austria and Hitler announced its
annexation after negotiations with the
British and the French it was agreed
that Germany would Annex the ethnically
German sudeten land from Czechoslovakia
Germany soon afterwards occupied half of
it which wasn't agreed the lithuanians
then caved into Hitler's demands for
this territory the British and the
French afraid of a new major war in
Europe did nothing to deter Hitler from
seizing more and more territory or
re-arming which served only to embolden
him an agreement was then made between
Germany and the Soviet Union to divide
Poland and on September 1 1939 the
Germans invaded and two weeks later the
Soviets would do the same beginning the
second world war France and Britain had
an agreement with Poland and declared
war on Germany although Germany would
quickly overrun France in 1941 the
Germans invaded the Soviet Union shortly
before declaring war in the United
States two very bad ideas the Germans
were initially very successful and by
1943 the Third Reich looked like this
the Allies particularly the British and
the United States began bombing
campaigns against German cities most
notably cologne Hamburg and of course
Dresden these attacks were designed to
destroy German factories and
infrastructure as well as frighten the
Germans into submission the German
economy didn't change drastically at the
beginning of the war since Germany had
already been producing arms for many
years one major difference between
Germany and the Allies was that Germany
was very reluctant to have women working
in the factories which ultimately
lowered the number of available workers
and Frontline soldiers in the conquered
territories the Nazis implemented a
policy of forced labor in Poland many
women were forced to work farmlands to
produce food whilst men worked in
factories many Jewish people alongside
anyone else is considered undesirable
were used for slave labor to produce
weapons some of which they sabotaged
throughout Europe the Jewish populations
were rounded up and placed into
concentration camps the original purpose
of these camps was not extermination but
forced labor although they all had
horrendous mortality rates before and
throughout the war the Nazis had
attempted to decide on what they would
do with the Jewish population of Europe
at first the Nazis wish to deport them
and in fact some were sent to Palestine
it wasn't until 1942 that the camps
began to explicitly exterminate
prisoners or that specialized
extermination camps were opened the
best-known camps being Auschwitz and
tablinka where over one and a half
million people were killed between them
throughout the Holocaust it is believed
that roughly five and a half million
Jews were killed alongside roughly the
same amount of poles and Soviet
prisoners gypsies those with mental and
physical disabilities as well as
homosexuals were also exterminated
alongside them having failed to conquer
the Soviet Union the tide of the war
changed against the Nazis and the
Soviets managed to force them all the
way back into Germany liberating many of
the concentration camps on the way at
the same time the United States United
Kingdom and Canada amongst others
invaded West in Europe and together they
managed to push the Nazis back into
Germany as well most of the German High
command including Hitler committed
suicide in April 1945 and Germany
surrendered in May thus ending the Third
Reich in the Nazi regime Germany was
occupied in the surviving Nazi leaders
were put on trial at Nuremberg where
many were sentenced to death after it
surrender Germany and Berlin were split
into occupied zones and both began the
process of denotification the Allied
occupation zones were soon combined into
the Federal Republic of Germany and the
soviet-occupied zones became the German
Democratic Republic known as Western
East Germany respectively they would
remain divided until 1990 at the end of
the Cold War ultimately the legacy of
Nazi Germany is complex the Nazis whilst
committing unimaginable crimes managed
to reinvigorate Germany and build it
into a military Powerhouse the Nazis
brought about immense suffering across
the European continent and their actions
produced many countries including
Germany itself to ruins the consequences
of Nazism are still being examined
because frankly it's still too soon to
know exactly what they are I hope you
enjoyed this episode and thank you for
watching

oh
you need to see this is the most amazing
thing I've ever seen Kevin Randleman is
about to perform a suplex on Fedor
emilianenko
I also thought we saw the first death in
MMA because Kevin threw him on his head
so hard
oh here we go
he is absolutely in the same categories
of the Wayne Gretzky's the Michael
Jordan's the John elways and yet the
only one doomed to be forgotten indeed
you're the greatest fighter to never
fight in the UFC that's to me the
biggest regret of all of MMA it is a
shame Fedor could have been over in the
UFC and we could have got the best
fighting the best I would have given
anything to see that the crazy Russians
know this you know the real story and
what the truth is she ordered Romulan
ankle is the baddest man on the planet
the baddest the baddest man of the
planet if that's so why did he never
make it to the UFC and you knew I was
going to bring up this man's name Dana
White he says recently he flew to an
undisclosed Island to meet with you and
your team I flew to some violent out in
the middle of nowhere okay did
everything that they asked to do what
exactly happened on that island we made
him the offering he's like
laughing at the offer true the UFC
actually offered you five million
dollars guaranteed no this is not true I
say everything exactly how it happened
the UFC didn't want me to fight there I
want it worse than the fans wanted now
believe me I think they wanted you we
went there for nothing because those
guys literally went there to not make a
deal now from the UFC's perspective
Fedor never faced real competition I
think how can you give him the respect
when he hasn't fought the guys I mean
these guys are fighting three times a
year the best fighters in the world but
you're going to give him the respect UFC
is the biggest organization in MMA
period there's no if ands or buts about
it if you're not a UFC champion even if
you're an elite even if you're fantastic
there's always going to be that thing
that's attached to you that you never
fought in the UFC but back in the early
2000s the best of the best were not in
the UFC
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
we had the best fighters in the world he
was so good dude he was so scary and so
stoic and he could submit you or he
could knock you out and God damn he was
good out of his 13 opponents and pride
nine were former or future UFC fighters
amongst them Antonio Rodrigo noguera who
became a UFC champion after Fedor beat
him twice former UFC champ Mark Coleman
who fought into UFC before and after
facing Fedor Fedor also beat him twice
in all of fedor's fights when he grabs a
hold of a limb he almost always finishes
this Mission and when someone grabs a
hold of his limb he almost always
escapes former UFC champion Kevin
Randleman you've seen that one already
MMA Legend Miracle croca who fought in
the UFC after losing to Fedor in one of
the greatest heavyweight fights of all
time and by the way Fedor was only six
foot tall 230 pounds that's relatively
small for a heavyweight fighter
another Russian fighter was also
wreaking havoc in Pride he was known as
the Grim Reaper
he also happened to be fedor's brother
Alexander but his Destiny would be
drastically different your brother
Alexander seems to be the complete
opposite of you he's cocky he's arrogant
in interviews very outspoken he's had
run-ins with the law covered in tattoos
how do two brothers
same parents same surroundings grow up

to it I think every little boy during
his childhood in Russia dreams about
becoming strong but in Theodore's case
that was not gonna happen does it
chicken woman
did you come from a very loving home did
your parents show you a lot of affection
or were they more harder disciplinary
parents there was discipline but
everything was done based on love
whereas for my younger brothers
Alexander it was not as strict we came
from a poor family there were four
children in our family so we only ate
potatoes and because his parents worked
a lot Fedor took care of his brothers
I followed his footsteps he used to take
me with him to the gym initially I was
not getting a lot of results I'm not all
that talented let's say
foreign
at 18 years old Fedor chooses to join
the Army every young man should be able
to stand up not only for himself but
also for his family and for his country
um
the Army allowed me to live without
parents Guardianship and to live with a
Stern group of men that's why it only
hardened me
I served for two years
for the first I served at a fire station
and the second year at the tank
divisions
Alex chooses another path he gets
involved in street fights crime and four
reasons undisclosed to this day ends up
serving a prison sentence as a teenager
he comes out of prison with those
tattoos now those aren't your average
kind of tattoos
under Joseph Stalin millions of people
were sent to forced labor camps known as
gulags within those prison camps an
organized criminal group emerged and
evolved over Generations the thieves in
law it has evolved into an autonomous
organization with its own set of laws
and customs dedicated to perfecting the
life lived under the shadow of the law
these real criminals were the elites of
the camp often sporting specific tattoos
related to Russian Orthodoxy and culture
and terrorizing other inmates
[Music]
the stars in front of the shoulders they
mean you're a criminal Authority
the symbol of a cathedral indicate the
number of years spent in prison each
Dome represents one year Alex Cathedral
has five domes true or false you once
tried to help your brother Alex break
out of prison no I never tried and
I always tried to help Alexander but if
he does something wrong he needs to take
responsibility the thieves in law swear
to their own set of laws including the
duty to support criminal ideas and the
rejection of any form of Labor did you
ever find it hard at that time to stay
away from that criminal element that was
so prevalent in Russia and I I guess so
attractive to so many fighters at the
time even during hard times in Russia
never looked in the direction of crime I
was always enticed only by the sports so
while Fedor starts training with fellow
soldiers in the Army Alex started doing
the same in prison both training from
the same goal under drastically
different ideas

in 2007 Pride collapses that's when Dana
White enters the picture we went out and
we made them a crazy offer to come into
the UFC and prove that he was the best
in the world and they turned it down
nobody in the right mind would have
turned that deal down you can get things
to instead Fedor joins a new MMA
promotion called affliction foreign
[Music]
ER UFC Champions Tim Sylvia and Andre
arlovsky Affliction Trilogy has been
canceled after only two events
Affliction shuts down I'm at a point now
where I'm just so sick of talking about
this guy because they make me so crazy
he is usually the route with the
fighters if not respect he doesn't want
to fight I talk some smack about them
they talk so smack about me it doesn't
mean that uh that we can't get deals
done and by the time he went to Strike
Force he was already you know miles on
the odometer I just don't think he was
the same guy that's when things take a
dark turn I said you're one punch away
from being worth zero
it's hitting that dude now right they
lay a bed and they turn the lights off
and they just go
dude I'm taking that deal Alex is
accused of kidnapping and sexually
assaulting a housekeeper he's sentenced
to four years of prison
[Applause]
2016 the fighting promotion of Chechen
leader ramzan khadirov puts on a fight
involving children Fedor is appalled and
calls out the organization a week later
as she's walking back from school
fedor's daughter gets brutally attacked

I'll see you guys in the next one

[Music]
my name is Aldo bazon as a young man in
America I often think about what my role
in society is supposed to be men are
trash everywhere in this country men are
portrayed in the media it's pervert
perverts are every the all these
commercials are out there where the
man's like the the lazy guy on the couch
a to the concept of masculinity and the
perception of man's role in society is
rapidly changing I don't need a man girl
you don't need noing m i can Finance
myself I can myself and I can feed
myself there's so many trash men out
there yes they're all trash this shift
is leaving young men like myself
grappling with questions about their
identity and sense of purpose we spent
half a century telling men that the
future was female and that women
allegedly didn't need to rely on men for
anything do you think men are important
like for
What on a quest to find answers to these
riddles and more I spoke to Everyday
People on the street and invited a few
respected experts to sit down and dig
deep into this controversial subject
imagine thinking that a man is going to
make you
happy may the Lord make his face to
shine upon us a man and a woman
remind me that I don't need a
[Music]
man what are some of the stereotypes
that you think of when you hear the word
masculinity domineering male figure I
suppose unnecessarily protective
everybody trying to put men up higher I
think toxic is probably the first thing
that comes to mind when you hear the
word toxic masculinity what do you think
of disguises itself behind chivalry
mansplaining controlling and unemotional
and woman should glide through the world
that I create instead of creating her
own world feeling like you have to be
like a big tough guy to be a man conquer
and and Destroy kind of
mentality
Mar well when you were in your 20s you
you were all in on the idea that
masculinity is toxic so much so that you
set out to make the documentary The Red
Pill can you talk to me about how you
changed in your beliefs as you were
making this documentary that was in my
20s and I I made quite a few films with
that mindset I I was really a feminist
filmmaker I was making films about
women's rights and also lgbtq issues and
I saw men as the oppressors of women
throughout history I believed that women
made 77 cents on a man's dollar and I
believed in the patriarchy so I set out
to make a film exposing misogynists even
while I was filming I was still really
resistant to what I was hearing I was
angry and was even getting hives just
thinking about how much I disliked what
they were saying but then when I put the
pen to paper I think that's when I
really started to question my beliefs I
couldn't argue with what they were
saying and when I did the fact checking
with the statistics that they were
putting out there about history and
about gender roles I realized that they
were right and then when I was
transcribing the feminist interviews I
was realizing there were a lot of plot
hes grave apologist inest supporting
woman
hating the feminists really
didn't understand the men's rights
argument very well and so because they
didn't understand it very well they
couldn't debate it very well don't even
start with that whole oh but you don't
think about the men's issue well then
you know what start your own movement
which they have but maybe make it a
little more about legitimate issues and
I realized that they weren't really
listening to the men's rights
perspective the more and more I've dug
into men's issues and boy issues the
more I realize how important a present
father is in a child's life and that
never became more apparent to me than in
the last 3 years of starting my own
journey of having a son and now a second
son when you remove masculinity you
don't get docile weak men you get
dangerous men that lash back out at
Society there's a really great African
proverb that says a child who is not
embraced by The Village will burn it
down to feel its
warmth over time it seems like toxic
masculinity has become a catchall term
for any male behavior that someone finds
offensive or
unpleasant this inconsistent arbitrary
criticism leads many men to fall into
the Trap of actual toxic Behavior as I
think about becoming a father one day I
want to understand just how important a
male figure is in a child's
life manhood isn't something that just
happens by accident tell me about your
upbringing and the masculine role models
that you had growing up well for me it
was a little it was a little bumpy you
know so I was born to a teenage mom so I
was born to a fatherless household I
think I was in Jeopardy before my
stepfather came around
statistically speaking I definitely was
a Jeopardy the guys going to jail the
mental illness everything says that
without a father or man in the house
You're vulnerable I don't want my family
my children to be vulnerable my presence
changes everything for them they can
sleep at night they know if there's a
threat their father will deal with it I
have an 8-year-old daughter who is
absolutely Dynamic who can do anything
athletically intellectually spiritually
and emotionally she is is a Dynamo the
fact is I don't want her playing against
boys in soccer I don't even let my sons
rough her up do you think I'm going to
let your son rough
r we have this idea right now that men
and women are completely equal that
they're they're almost interchangeable
is that correct no not even close I mean
my wife was gone for the weekend my
children could see a big difference
between mommy and daddy she brings this
softness this this nurturing I bring
this charge this demand this expectation
and it's not that way it's just
masculinity who am I naturally as a man
it's tough for boys today and I feel for
them because they are told that they're
toxic if they hold the door open all
these things and that were seen as
chivalrous are now looked down upon I
teach my sons they they open the door
for their mother and get this they open
it for their sister we put a premium on
our role you know everything should be
equal not equal in responsibility we're
equal in value and the fact that we're
not the same as what allows us to shine
my wife's femininity is able to flourish
because of me but so is my masculinity
who I am as a man and a father very
different without her contrast there my
sons wouldn't get the same lesson my
daughter wouldn't get the same lesson we
have seen the damaging impact of society
public figures and the media vilifying
masculinity and disregarding the role of
fathers at home but what do our
psychological establishment say about
men's roles in relationships and Society
at Large Dr Khloe carmichel New York
clinical psychologist and relationship
expert good to have you here thanks for
having me this a great subject a lot of
people are interested in this idea of
that masculinity is is synonymous with
violence or War these other negative
stereotypes when people start to believe
this it makes sense that they would want
to neutralize masculinity if not destroy
it all together one of the things that
to me has stood out as a psychologist is
that the American Psychological
Association came out with these guides
lines about working with men and boys
and it really in my opinion pathologized
traditional masculinity the entire
document was really full of criticisms
of things like a drive for Success a
drive for power a drive for competition
all of which are actually things that
can really help Society are women more
dissatisfied in the relationships with
men today yes I mean statistics show
that women and men are actually both
unhappy and there could be a lot of
different social drivers around that but
I do think it's important to look at and
consider the fact that maybe we're
forcing people into these politically
correct boxes that don't necessarily fit
for example women don't typically even
say want a date a man who makes less
money than they do women typically don't
want a date a man who's shorter than
they are that points to the simple fact
that women tend to be drawn to a man who
is at least able to provide and to
protect I just feel like there's a lack
of acknowledgement about the role of men
and their
contributions just like these young
women want a man who's going to love and
respect them as a woman I would
encourage them to think about offering
the same gift to their boys and
men do you think traditional masculinity
is good I don't think anything
traditional is good I think everything
is supposed to evolve what's
traditionally masculine or feminine
doesn't work in today's society you
think that Society needs strong men
women can be strong too but talking
about women does society need strong men
I would only say certain jobs do we not
need men to protect us I don't think we
need men to protect people in particular
cuz I don't really believe on the
implications of social gender what about
building the roads and going to war and
you know and sewage jobs and
construction don't we need men for
certain things we need just bodies for a
lot of things what people call men power
is just body power and guess what women
have bodies too depression for a man is
that feeling nobody wants me I'm not
needed anymore basically I'm out of work
nobody there to respond to me nobody
there for me to fix help serve support
being out of work is the major
depression for men or being in a
marriage where you feel you can't do
anything to make your partner happy and
that's why depression is very different
for a man than for a woman men and women
are different biologically we're
different and to respect those
differences is not equality when the
people say we want gender equality what
they're asking for is gender sameness
men and women are different in a
positive way can you talk to me a little
bit more about that need for seeing a
healthy relationship between a man and
wife and that effect it has on the kids
yeah it's so so so important 25% of
children today are growing up in a
household without a father 50% of
African American boys are growing up
without a father you have no role model
at all of I can be a powerful good man
they don't know what that is and a good
man is someone that women trust so does
my mother trust dad the prevailing
narrative today is that traditional
gender roles aren't necessary anymore
because they were completely a result of
a social construction yes yes let me
interrupt it was a social construction
by wise people to make men good and make
women happy that was a social
construction that did it that's why my
family could be so happy growing up it
was the 50s a man could earn enough
money to support his wife she could
spend time with her children till they
grew up she could hire help to help her
with her children she could live in a
safe neighborhood that's all gone middle
class is crashing down we've gone too
far we've gotten too Progressive and
taking a couple steps back into
traditional gender roles is probably
what we need right now well what suffers
is boys what suffers is girls boys don't
know what it means means to be a man
girls don't know what it means to be a
woman where you can depend on someone
and you don't have to do it all our
children are confused John Roseman has a
master's degree in Psychology is the
father of two and the grandfather of
seven he has been offering parenting
advice through his column and books for
decades can you tell me about how this
idea of the family center being the
husband and wife has changed throughout
your lifetime the American family over
the last 50 years has become a
matriarchy the American father is
becoming more and more
irrelevant that Dad is not the child
rearing Authority mom is the dad's
opinion it's often treated as uh
irrelevant his voice is a nuisance when
boys grow up without fathers they don't
understand what authentic masculinity
looks like and they get in involved in
drugs and they get involved in gangs and
they get involved in you know other
things that are symptoms of a fake
masculinity that is overtaking America
women uh greater and greater percentage
of them really do believe that they can
get along without men why can't they men
embody traits that women don't have and
women don't realize it but when push
comes to shove women women will look to
men for protection what are some ways
that you've seen as a child therapist
that education and child raising has
changed that's had a negative impact on
young boys the primary example of this
is the diagnosis of ADHD I told probably
three out of every four kids are boys
the message says there's something wrong
with you and this pill will correct it I
think translating the sense of of
induced helplessness in our young male
population whenever I hear of a young
person in his mid 20s even early 30s
who's living in the parents' basement
it's always a young man and I think that
this reflects that young men are just
kind of losing a sense of
purpose and we don't
realize depre ation of the American male
is going to seriously weaken American
culture we need men we need women but we
need
men what's your personal message to boys
and young men something that a lot of
women have wrong about men is they think
that men are about domination and
control and I actually think ultimately
what men
want I think they want to be love loved
and appreciated and seen for their
sacrifices
and I don't think that's what our
society is doing right
now I hope that men would figure out
that they were created for God they were
created to be a son a husband and a
father and it's okay to be a man sharing
your life with someone that's what life
is really about and it's through good
relationships with somebody who's very
different from you so many women say
what do I need a man for well you're
never going to have a man until you
figure it out I hope that men have the
fortitude to stand up against this
assault I don't think that they need to
wait for permission from anybody that's
part of the masculine role I think is to
be able to just assert who he is and to
be who he is my uh personal message to
young boys young men is that uh your
highest calling in life is to be a good
husband more than than anything else
would be your greatest contribution to
our
culture when masculinity is vilified the
path inevitably leads to a more feminine
culture dissatisfied women confused
children and a broken Society but when
traditional virtues like assertiveness
strength and confidence are harnessed
for good they enable men to pursue
greatness protect others and Rise To
Life's most difficult
challenges so men harness your
masculinity seek out responsibility and
lead with
[Music]
courage

history is filled with short-lived
nations those which appeared from
nowhere attempted to forge a place for
themselves in the world and then
promptly died Rhodesia are mostly
unrecognized Africa nation was one such
example which managed to eke out an
existence of 14 years which obviously
raises the question why was Rhodesia
such a short-lived nation and what
happened to it so a quick overview by
1964 South Rhodesia named after the late
19th century explorer Cecil Rhodes was a
British colony in the UK government was
painfully aware of its empires coming
collapse in Africa now many of Britain's
colonies there were administrated by a
white minority in Rhodesia was no
different the London government under
Prime Minister Harold Wilson said that
decolonization would only be granted on
the condition of majority rule as of
1964 Rhodesia operated on a system of
what's called responsible government
which was centred in the city of
Salisbury nowadays called Harare it had
its own prime minister and could control
its own internal affairs with some
British oversight its prime minister was
a man called Ian Smith who wouldn't
grant the franchise based upon race but
offered to granted based upon wealth
which was basically the same thing since
the wealth of Rhodesia was almost
exclusively controlled by the white
minority which made up 8% of the
population negotiations over this went
nowhere and Smith's government declared
independence Britain immediately
petitioned the UN to dissuade other
nations from recognizing Rhodesian
independence and it also began an
economic embargo and this most notably
included an oil embargo and led to
Britain implementing a nine-year
blockade of a Mozambique port here
through its Rhodesia was importing oil
Rhodesia had very few friends borrowing
some unofficial support from Portugal
has the oil imports in South Africa
because obviously Britain's blockade of
this one port was incredibly expensive
and also incredibly ineffective because
as it turns out Africa has more than one
port from Rhodesia could simply get oil
from South Africa whilst international
governments denounced Rhodesia's
existence as being illegitimate you
should know that British and American
public opinion at the time was extremely
supportive so after the Declaration of
Independence opposition groups in
Rhodesia turned to political violence
but first the primary opposition was
ZAPU the Zimbabwe African people's union
which then splintered and was eclipsed
by Zanu
which stood for the Zimbabwe African
National Union which was led by a
certain Robert Mugabe
Zann who was a communist group which had
received training in China as well as
equipment and support from the Soviet
Union the Rhodesian government received
some support from Portugal
it was heavily reliant on South African
weapons and material Rhodesia also saw a
sizeable inward migration from South
Africa as well as receiving veterans
from the Vietnam War mostly Americans
and Australians
the ongoing conflict became known as the
bush war and to put it mildly
it was absolutely brutal in the early
1970s the scale of the war increased
massively and despite their small
population the white Rhodesians were
able to maintain their hold in the
country for 15 years which given the
embargo and hostile neighbors was more
than most would have expected however
given the support that the guerrillas
were getting alongside their growing
numbers meant that for Rhodesia total
victory became ever more difficult
eventually the defences started to crack
and white civilian deaths increased
which in turn led to emigration to South
Africa less available families meant
less taxes and less soldiers which meant
less ability to safeguard which led to
more emigration you get the idea
in the end Smith pushed for a settlement
to end the war but in a way that gave
white people in Rhodesia greater
authority than the population share
would suggest in the end he reached what
was called the internal settlement with
opposition groups who were led by Abu
Musa Rea WA the settlement was backed by
a whites-only referendum and in 1979 the
first universal election was held which
saw misery were become Prime Minister
and shortly after this the country was
renamed his imbaba Rhodesia Mugabe and
the other rebels saw this as nothing
more than a sham and vowed to keep
fighting Britain refused to accept this
election as legitimate and so him as a
rebel met with its government to propose
a new transition period this led to the
Lancaster House agreement which saw
Zimbabwe Rhodesia revert to British rule
briefly until new elections could be
held in 1980 the first internationally
recognised general election was held
which for Mugabe went comfortably it was
shortly after this that Zimbabwe
Rhodesia simply became Zimbabwe and thus
the short-lived minority rule nation was
no more I hope you enjoyed this episode

if you look at the modern map of Europe
you'll see a curious exclave along the
Baltic Sea
this is Kaliningrad and has been a part
of the Russian Federation since 1991 the
more observant of you will have noticed
that it isn't attached to Russia which
raises the question why does Russia own
Kaliningrad and how did it come to
possess it well first of all the region
centered on a city of the same name
hasn't been known as Kaliningrad for
very long but prior to this was known as
Konigsberg from the 13th century it was
a part of the lands of the Teutonic
order and by the 16th century
Koenigsberg was the central part of the
newly formed duchy of prussia a puppet
state of the Polish Lithuanian
Commonwealth
it wasn't long before Prussia broke free
in königsberg was the site which showed
the first King of Prussia crowned within
a few centuries it had grown to this and
by the late 19th century was the
dominant force within the newly formed
German Empire as you'll be able to guess
Konigsberg whilst not the capital held a
special place within the German Empire
as one of its cultural centres in the
birthplace of its ruling dynasty the
point I'm trying to get at is for about
six centuries prior to this point
Konigsberg and its surrounding area was
primarily German although you should
note that there were sizeable Polish and
Lithuania minorities there too the
status of this land didn't really change
until the Second World War although you
should be aware that the 1919 Treaty of
Versailles after the first world war
tore Germany lose this territory in its
ruling Prussian dynasty as you'll notice
it did keep her nice Berg itself but
this time as its own exclave known as
eastern prussia you'll also notice that
it did lose this land to the newly
formed Lithuania which throughout the
period of the Vimal republic was a
hotbed of support that a growing
national socialist movement which soon
saw us as an adult Hitler running the
show he got this land back from
Lithuania and also QED World War Two
which Germany lost in 1945 Soviet forces
advanced on Konigsberg and this led to
many of the people living there fleeing
west deeper into Germany after a
destructive siege the city fell to the
Soviets and after Germany surrender its
borders were once again redrawn by the
victorious powers this time Germany was
to lose Konigsberg in the area around it
to Stalin to USSR and it's no Eastern
European puppet States the region of
East Prussia was thus divided into three
parts
the southern part went to Poland and the
northern part went to the USSR but as a
part of the Lithuanian Soviet republic
and as for the center which included the
city of königsberg itself this went to
the USSR's Russian Soviet republic so
why wasn't it given to Lithuania despite
being next door well at this point
Lithuania had only recently been
incorporated into
the USSR mostly it's the will of those
who lived there and thus Stalin didn't
trust them with an area of such military
importance furthermore the region was
subject to widespread ethnic cleansing
which saw most of its remaining Germans
deported to East Germany and replaced
mostly with Russians that said when
Stalin died his successor Nikita
Khrushchev did offer Kaliningrad to
Lithuania who said no why because the
people there weren't Lithuanian and its
leaders felt that incorporating so many
Russians into its territory would cause
long-term issues thus Kaliningrad would
remain a part of the Russian Soviet
republic throughout the lifespan of the
USSR until its collapse in 1991 they
smoked a point in which the status of
the area could have changed Lithuania
still wasn't interested in Kaliningrad
for the same reasons as before and this
view was shared by Poland that left
Germany which had a long-standing
historical claim to the area so why
didn't they get it first of all it was
because the Russian Federation inherited
the lands of the Russian Soviet republic
and also because Germany didn't want it
during the process of reunification the
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
didn't push to regain the exclave his
first priority was the reunification of
East and West and he felt that trying to
force the issue of Kaliningrad would
upset the global powers he was trying to
negotiate with Britain and France were
already wary of a reunified Germany and
to give it extra land was to them a
cause for yet more concern and so
Germany never tried to reclaim
konigsberg which was barely even German
anymore and for Russia
Kaliningrad was just as Russian as any
other bit of it and so why would they
even contemplate letting it go I hope

It's 8:10!
What's going on here? Are you finished with studying?
Actually Aunty 
Every time I see you you're either on your phone or watching Tv
Exams are on your head and it's not like you're a topper 
You get grades that are just enough to pass
This time don't even get that much 
You're the first girl in our family who is going to fail
Aunty, I studied a lot 
I am prepared with Abacus 
So I thought...
You think you're very smart ?
You don't need to think too much 
What you need is to study!
Look at your father he's a topper
No you decide
You want to be a topper like your father or a failure all your life?
No Aunty I will study 
I will show you by coming first in the competition 
Let's see
Your father is called a human computer 
He has won numerous awards 
Now you decide if you want to be a topper like your father 
Or a failure like your mother who has passed on 
You weren't ever a failure mom 
And nor am I... or ever going to be 
I will win this competition like you and dad 
I'll be  a topper like my father 
I'll be  a topper like my father 
I'll be  a topper like my father 
You've always been my topper my child 
Oh my goodness did I fall asleep?
Tomorrow is the competition 
I still have a lot to prepare and study how could I fall asleep!
I know you must already be prepared my child 
It's also important to sleep 
What if you fall asleep in the exam ?
Did you eat anything?
Actually...
Wow! you won?
I did!
We'll celebrate together once you win your trophy and come tomorrow 
Ok?
But dad...
I'm not listening to anything now 
And I''ll wake you up early tomorrow ok?
Now rest 
Goodnight dad 
Goodnight my child 
850 X 745 ?
6,33,250
6750 X 84 ?
5,67,000
Very good!
Now I'll be a little late tonight in getting home but your aunt will be home 
Dad! keep the testing on please!
Ok!
2354 X 765 ?
18,00,810 ?
You are going to rock!
Yes! Fingers crossed 
I really hope I win 
Yes you will .... now let us pack your bag 
Take it take it come on ... 
Let"s do it !
Yes !
What Happened? Did you Fail ?
Aunty I had prepared a lot for it
But I don't know what happened 
I just blanked out 
I couldn't understand what was happening 
Just a certificate?
You didn't even come 1st or 2nd ?
I knew it !
This would only happen 
Because you're on your phone all day !
What does your generation know about how hard we've worked
And gotten ahead in life 
If the electricity was out we would light a candle and study
Your father has worked so hard to get ahead 
He wasn't on his phone like you all day 
Take a look at my son Montu 
He topped las year in this same competition 
And you ?
You turned out to be a good for nothing 
You're just a Failure!
Sister!
Good you're home
You pamper her too much 
And look what she's done now 
She has Failed and come home
So?
What is wrong in failing ?
You think failing is a good thing ?
My Sister, actually your husband called..
He was asking when about when you  were coming home ?
And Montu has his exams as well , you go teach him
And I'll talk to Arushi 
Alright 
I understand what you're trying to say... I can take a hint 
But remember one thing 
Your children won't go ahead in life unless you pressurize them 
Now it's your choice 
She's your daughter ... you can go ahead and make her a failure 
I'm so sorry Dad 
I've let you down 
I Failed... I'm a big Failure! 
No!
You are not a failure!
My child a failure is not one who loses
What do you mean?
A Failure is someone who doesnt even try...  
And you tried very hard 
But Dad you always win so many trophies 
You always come first 
What?
who told you this? That I always come first ...
But you .. 
Just a minute 
I've failed many times my daughter
Your mom was the one who got good grades 
She was a topper
Sharper than even me in Math 
After having you, she wanted to spend all her time with you
She told me to keep winning trophies 
"My trophy is my Arushi"
Then she got sick
And after she passed away I decided 
Every Trophy I won would be for you and your mom
But winning trophies wasn't so easy 
I failed a lot 
But I never gave up 
Always remember one thing 
You won't see the stars until you fall 
Failure is very important in life 
Failure teaches you to learn more and try more 
Do you know when Thomas Edison invented the right bulb
It took him over 1000 trys
Imagine if he gave up on is first try ?
So never be afraid of your failures
Be afraid to give up 
You're right dad ... I won't give up 
I will try again 
I'm not a failure 
It's just a minor set back 
Now that's my girl 
Now for this try of yours we need to party 
Yes!.. Yay
I've learnt my lesson that failing doesn't mean you are a failure

uh what are you doing
you're not actually going into an
asteroid field it'd be crazy to follow
us wouldn't we
so you've gotten hooked on sci-fi movies
like interstellar
and modern day explorers like elon musk
and now you're obsessed with the idea of
colonizing and exploring space
so you do some research on how we can
colonize space and boom
it costs too damn much for example if
you're going to take any long duration
flight to say mars
you're going to need a lot of water a
standard bottle of water weighs around 1
pound
and at spacex's rates it costs around 2
500 to launch one water bottle from
earth
now as long as it takes that much money
to launch water building structures and
raw materials into space
space exploration and space colonies are
going to move at a pathetically slow
rate
that's why some aspiring pioneers think
that all you need to solve this problem
is to look up these are all the known
asteroids in our solar system as of
2018.
asteroids contain practically an
unlimited amount of natural resources we
could harvest in space
instead of having to launch it up into
space i think what we're doing here on
earth we're waging war and fighting each
other to pull precious metals and other
resources deemed rare out of the ground
and this is our life down here on this
speck
we call earth and there's this abundance
of materials in the universe
in fact asteroids or space mining to be
specific might just be the gateway the
stepping stone we need
to conquer that final frontier and
according to people like neil degrassi
tyson
if jeff bezos doesn't beat them to it
the first trillionaires will probably be
space miners
and by the way the first trillionaire is
going to be the first person to exploit
space resources on asteroids on comets
so let's explore that next trillion
dollar industry
space mining all great ideas
have a flavor of science fiction
otherwise it's an ordinary idea
and so it has just the right amount of
crazy and just the right amount of hey
that's you know the resources out there
sir the possibility of successfully
navigating an asteroid field is
approximately three thousand seven
hundred and twenty to one never tell me
the odds
one asteroid perhaps maybe uh 30 50 feet
across
could in fact yield billions billions of
dollars
in rewards if you want to get on this
trillion
dollar action before it's too late
you're gonna need some baseline
knowledge on things like rocket science
programming and data science
so if you want a cut of those trillions
if you want to play a role in humanity's
next step
that is where today's video sponsor
comes in brilliant
brilliant allows you to learn all these
things you need for space mining
gravitational physics special relativity
solar energy
through interactive lessons that allow
you to learn visually hands-on instead
of with boring lectures and memorizing
formulas
i myself love watching free educational
videos on youtube
but feels like this are a lot like
working out sure you can learn a little
by watching others work out but if you
don't actively put your brain through
the paces yourself
you're never gonna truly understand this
stuff and brilliant allows you to do
just that their 60

asteroids are clumps of leftover rock
and dust from when the plants were
forming in our solar system
and although mining asteroids may sound
a little far-fetched it's already
happened
[Music]
back in 2005 japan's hayabusa spacecraft
landed on the surface of an asteroid
after a two year flight
the hayabusa dock with the floating rock
for two years collected a tiny sample of
the asteroid along with a ton of data
and started his flight backward returned
to earth in
like lower 2010 this mission is what
really sparked this new space race for
extraterrestrial mining
no longer was space mining science
fiction the technology to harvest space
rocks already exist and all we had to do
was up the scale
so now that we know that it's possible
what kind of asteroids should we be
looking for
that's exactly what the samples of the
hayabusa brought back revealed
yeah so it's more than just harnessing
the asteroid it's
creating an entire business model that
get
gets you access to asteroids in the
first place one type of asteroids are
the ones that contain valuable metals
then gold platinum and others like
palladium iridium and more
these metals happen to be the same ones
we use in our smartphones and other
electronics
metals that create a lot of pollution
and destruction to terrestrially mine
these type of asteroids are thought to
have formed during the formation of
planets like ours
during this formation all that pressure
heats up the planet's matter and turns
it into liquid
the heavier elements like metals
gravitate towards the core much like how
oil and water separate themselves in a
glass of water
and that's why it's hard to find things
like gold and platinum near the surface
of the planet they're mostly located
deep within the earth and the fact that
we need these metals makes them even
more valuable
the theory is these types of asteroids
were the result of planets colliding
together during their formation
where those inner metal cores were
lodged out into space they're like the
fragments of planets that never formed
fully
but many of them all the materials have
already been segregated for us
and so you get the heavy metals in the
center and the lighter
materials in the top you fragment this
body and now you have chunks of
asteroids that are
pure heavy metals platinum iridium
osmium
gold take the asteroid 16 psyche for
example
it has a 140 mile diameter around the
same distance from la to san diego
and 95 percent of it is made up of
metals like iron nickel and maybe even
golden platinum
which bloomberg estimated to be worth a
theoretical 700 quintillion dollars in
today's metal prices
although golden asteroids do sound
tempting the problem with mining
asteroids like these for metals is that
even if you extracted a bunch of metals
by the time you got it back to our
planet you would have already spent more
money than it would it cost just to mine
the materials here
that is where the second type of
asteroids come in c-types
and c-type ashwas contains something
that we have plenty of here but is worth
this weight in gold out in space
water like we talked about earlier if
we're gonna explore and colonize space
we're gonna need a lot of water a lot of
water that's very expensive to launch up
from the ground
what's valuable in space is not the same
thing that's valuable down here for
example
you can ask what is the value of a
gallon of water
already in space that's different from a
gallon of water here on earth when nasa
needs water it's got a whole water up
space with it not only is water vital to
our health and survival
but it also makes for great fuel once
water is extracted from c-type asteroids
its hydrogen and oxygen can be broken
down into hydrogen fuel and oxidizer
that means that the first entrepreneurs
that are able to mine water from
asteroids would be able to sell
something right away in space
that every space traveler will need
if you can extract water from one of the
asteroids then you have water in space
what's that worth to nasa all right if
they if they can provide that to nasa
for less
than what it takes nasa to get these
resources into space to do whatever it
needs to do
in space then that's a business model
right there
with the goal of setting up space gas
stations in low earth orbit
and placing more further and further out
into the cosmos so we can extend our
range
just like how electric cars need a ton
of charges around the country for long
range travel to be possible fuel takes
up 90 percent of the mass of today's
rockets
so someone can devise a way to allow
rocket companies and government agencies
to carry less fuel
making spaceflight drastically cheaper
by refilling in space they will rush to
you with money in hand
once this fuel infrastructure is up and
running by mining these asteroids with
water in them
then setting up colonies mining the
metal-based ashtrays and even setting up
space hotels makes a lot more economic
sense
the first asteroids we tackle would be
near-earth asteroids to keep it easy
that's all fine and dandy but how are we
gonna actually extract these raw
materials from asteroids
mining asteroids is a bit more
complicated than just latching onto it
sticking a drill in and calling in a day
because asteroids are so small they're
held together by just a tiny amount of
gravity
if you land it too hard drilled too hard
pull out too hard
you're gonna risk the asteroids simply
breaking apart around you this means
engineers have to get a little creative
on how they plan on mining
one company paving the way for
extracting water out of asteroids is
called trans astra
there are plans to direct sunlight onto
a concentrated spot on the asteroid with
basically big mirrors
since the gravity is so low this
concentrated sunlight is enough to break
the surface
this turns the water and other chemicals
into vapor and that vapor is collected
and stored as ice
they've already shown this to work on
simulated asteroids and vacuum chambers
here on land
in this clip we excavate a hole while
extracting water and co2 from a sample
of asteroid simulant they're building a
prototype as we speak and if all goes
well
they'll be piggybacking on a spacex
falcon 9 rocket soon to test how a small
version of their craft to make sure it
works in space
once they achieve that proof of concept
they plan on having a full-size craft
capable of mining asteroids up to 30
meters in diameter
and be able to use some of the water it
collects as its own field to navigate to
other asteroids
with the ultimate goal of having a swarm
of these things mimicking the behavior
of bees
bees go out collect pollen and return
home to create honey
but instead of pollen it's asteroids and
instead of honey
it's veal and other commodities
[Music]
when this new space race for
extraterrestrial mining was sparked back
in 2010 when japan's hayabusa craft
returned
a new startup quickly emerged planetary
resources
with its own all-star silicon valley
team and investors like google's eric
schmidt
and filmmaker james cameron not too long
after planetary resources got its own
competitor
deep space industries these two became
the icons of the space mining effort
and for a while what was a sci-fi pipe
change seen as if it might actually
happen
but you can only go so long without
making a profit
and in 2018 planetary resources went
under with deep space industries falling
the year after
there was more focus on the religion of
space than the business of space
one former team member recalled and for
all intents and purposes the space
mining industry was practically dead
but not all hope is lost nasa's
osiris-rex just touched down on an
asteroid named bennu on october 20 2020.
it already successfully collected a
sample of it to return back to earth
and this asteroid happens to be rather
dangerous to us with a 1 in 2 700 chance
of impacting earth between the year 2175
and 2199
japan's second hayabusa 2 craft
collected another sample from another
asteroid on november 2019
and is scheduled to return to earth soon
on december 6 2020
[Music]
which brings us to the reality of space
mining does the chicken come first
or the egg do we focus on making space
flight cheaper first
do we try to build a moon or mars base
first or do we cope with the expensive
cost to try to mine asteroids to make
fuel in space
to make space fight cheaper time will
tell but one thing is for sure
money talks
rockefeller became the richest man in
history and when jeff bezos cracked 200
billion dollars in net worth in august
2020
he only came in at half of what
rockefeller was worth
and how did rockefeller create that
wealth by dominating a new untapped

to produce one pound of coffee beans
Farmers need to harvest more than 1500
of these cherries
each one contains two seeds that will be
sorted processed and roasted
before they reach your cup
in 2022 the average U.S price for a
pound of coffee was 5.89
but there's a specialty category called
single origin coffee that can easily
cost over 30 dollars per pound
some exclusive harvests cost over 80
dollars per pound so what makes this
coffee so special and why is it so
expensive
it's November in Erie County Kenya and
the coffee Harvest is in full swing
there are over 12.5 million coffee farms
in the world almost 95 are owned by
smallholders like Joseph
he runs a one acre Farm part of which he
inherited from his parents
coffee is all about equality if you
produce coffee with a higher quality the
higher prices you get for your coffee
coffee grows differently depending on
the altitude climate soil and sun
Farms here sit around 1700 meters above
sea level in Rich volcanic soil the
coffee grow very slow they take long
time to mature coffee take time to
mature the better the quality almost
everywhere every farmer is growing
coffee
high altitude coffee produces fruity and
floral flavors
drinking coffee brewed from Beans
exclusively from one region ensures that
those distinct flavors come through it's
what's called single origin coffee the
quality and unique taste are the biggest
reasons it can cost so much
but achieving that quality isn't easy
the terrain here is too uneven for
machines so farmers pick the coffee by
hand
one Cherry at a time
for coffee ripeness is key
um
foreign
Mary has been growing coffee for over 25
years
kutoka
Guam bamboo economic
50 something
each branch has ripe and unripe cherries
so she has to pay close attention while
picking
the way coffee is harvested here in
Kenya is very different from how it's
done in Brazil the world's largest
coffee producer on huge farms with flat
terrain the Harvest is mechanized
the trees are at a lower elevation and
the yields are higher
mechanized production is more efficient
but this efficiency can hurt quality
control
when the whole tree is picked at once
ripe and unripe cherries are lumps
together
this is commodity coffee destined for
mass production and Industrial use its
price is low and volatile
the highest quality coffee is called
specialty coffee
this coffee has unique attributes that
expert tasters called Q graders rate the
highest
single origin coffee is often rated at
the highest end of specialty coffee
because of its distinct flavors
both specialty coffee and a lot of
commodity coffee come from the same
plant Cafe Arabica but not all arabica
coffee is created equal
this can of ground coffee is 100 Arabica
it costs around eight dollars a pound
in 2022 a single origin coffee grown in
Panama sold for over six thousand
dollars a pound at auction
also 100 Arabica
the better the flavor and the smaller
the Harvest the more expensive the
coffee
back at Mary's Farm there's still work
to be done
after harvesting workers sort the
cherries to weed out any defects
these negatively impact the flavor and
lower the price of the coffee
but they need to work quickly processing
coffee soon after harvest is key to
maintaining its quality
[Music]
processing infrastructure is expensive
so most farms in Kenya share centralized
facilities
over a thousand Farmers from the region
bring their coffee here
each processing method has a different
impact on taste
but they all have the same end goal
separate the seed from the fruit
these are the five stages of coffee
processing the red cherry the wet
parchment dry parchment green coffee and
roasted coffee beans
this is the washed process it's the most
common way to process coffee in Kenya
after weighing and inspecting the coffee
workers remove the outer skin in a
process called depulping
then they place it in fermentation tanks
where it rests for 12 to 14 hours
fermentation breaks down the mucilage
the sticky inner layer of the fruit so
it can be washed away
the next day workers push coffee through
a series of channels cleaning off the
seeds
this is also where one of several
grading processes takes place
workers separate lower quality less
dense beans which float to the surface
even though these beans sell for Less
they still provide important income to
producers
the denser coffee flows to soaking tanks
to ensure any remaining mucilage is
removed
once the seed is free the coffee flows
out of the tanks and onto drying tables
Roasters sell coffee either as a blend
of beans from different countries or a
single origin but there's no officially
agreed upon definition of the term it
can refer to a form a Cooperative or a
country consumers who buy this type of
coffee are usually seeking a particular
flavor or aroma
the costs of processing transportation
and running a roasting business are all
bundled into the price customers pay for
coffee it's so expensive to get coffee
here everything from the barn to the
port everything has gone up the boxes
where we ship your coffee first
subscriptions or at home consumption
that packaging has gone up with single
origin single producer when you have the
producer's name it's an indicator that
we paid more for that coffee because of
the relationship if you're paying in the
range of 21 to 26 dollars it's because
we've invested in these areas that are
important to us and we hope are
important to them
companies like metric play an important
role in the coffee supply chain
most coffee is consumed outside of the
country it's produced in and how coffee
is roasted has a big impact on its taste
getting the best flavor out of single
origin coffee requires careful roasting
coffee is roasted in big machines like
this
Roasters take green coffee and heat it
evenly to develop its flavor
this is 20 pounds of Costa Rican honey
processed coffee from solisi Cordero
which is the husband and wife team in
terrazoo
horror uses sight smell and sensors to
track how the roast is developing
finding the ideal roast level for each
coffee is a skill that takes years to
master
this drawer that I'm using is called the
Trier and it allows us to see the color
of the development as we go through the
rose
and also to smell how the coffee is
smelling the green coffee will smell
kind of like hay or grass you'll smell
it gets sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
you can smell some of that acidity come
out it'll smell almost vinegary-ish as
soon as that vinegar starts to fade just
a little bit and there's a sweet
fruitiness and a sweet baked goodness
that's our finished development
metric roasts coffee for an average of
11 minutes before horror releases it
into the cooling tray to stop the
roasting process
by comparison commodity Coffee Roasters
favor a darker roast which can cover up
defects and make a blend of beans from
different countries taste more uniform
while dark roasts are generally bitter
medium and light roasts offer more
sweetness and bright acidity
you can blast it for a minute and a lot
of commodity coffee is just blasted as
quick as possible but it really rushes
through all of those phases that develop
over the flavors going through those
steps to get exactly the best qualities
out of that cup we don't add anything to
Coffee everything was intrinsically
there as the raw product from the farmer
from the growing conditions
light roasts also highlight the unique
flavors of a region allowing two single
origin coffees to taste very different
the tricky part about single origin
versus blend is that you can achieve
Stellar results with Blends and
sometimes really subpar with single
origin and the same thing can be the
other way around
how a coffee is processed can have a
have an impact on its flavor and price
the washed process produces delicious
coffee but it's expensive and can be
wasteful
we use a lot of water and there is a
many challenges how to dispose that
waste water but we are trying to work
our net by recycling the water we are
using
after spreading out the coffee workers
move it to a clean set of tables
where they continuously turn it by hand
this coffee takes around 14 days to
reach a desired moisture content over 11
to 12 percent
the goal is uniform beans free of
defects
coffee at this stage is called parchment
coffee because of the paper-like layer
of material that surrounds the seed
before producers ship the coffee they
Mill it to remove the parchment
this is a small machine used for local
consumption when Milling large
quantities the coffee goes through
another round of grading
each country has its own methods of
grading in Kenya each Bean is classified
by size the shape and color of the bean
also impact the grade but often the
larger denser beans are the most
expensive
after months of work producers are left
with what's called green coffee
this is the product that will be
exported and roasted in consuming
countries
but this is also when the process
becomes more opaque
Farmers don't always know how much a
buyer pays an exporter so they don't
know if they're being cut out of
potential profit
The Benchmark for the price of arabica
coffee follows What's called the Sea
Market
it's an exchange like the stock market
where traders buy and sell contracts
based on the expected future value of
coffee
but it doesn't consider the quality of
the coffee and the price is volatile
which makes it hard for Farmers to
operate sustainably
in 2019 the average closing price was
one dollar and two cents per pound its
lowest point that year 87 cents
despite inflation and increased cost of
production the Sea Market is almost the
same as it was in 1980.
Joseph is able to operate profitably but
that isn't the case for many farmers
around the world
a 2019 study found that 44 of
smallholder coffee farmers were living
in poverty
specialty coffee is bought at a premium
above the commodity price
Joseph makes around three dollars and
eighteen cents a pound
due to the high quality of our coffee
there is a lot of demand but our
expectation is that the demand should go
with higher prices
he says 4.55 cents a pound would be more
sustainable but his prices have actually
decreased over the past few years
I don't know the reason why mostly
reacted World Market has flooded their
coffee but we still need more
explanation on why the coffee is going
down when we are still trying our best
to maintain our quality coffee
for those who are producing less than 5
kilos from One Tree they are not even
breaking even the effort we make to
produce latic quality coffee I can say
we are not well compensated by those
prices
growing coffee requires steep
Investments which don't always pay off
for farmers
many Roasters in the industry are
working towards direct trade
Partnerships that benefit the coffee
producer
I'm looking to do two things Source high
quality coffees but also establish
year-over-year relationships
some Roasters also publish the prices
they pay for green coffee but the level
of transparency varies
Wheels Roasters need to do our job to
educate consumers as to the difference
between a product from Colombia that's
Source barely the source with full
transparency in a product of Colombia
that has no traceability and is cheap if
it's cheap coffee that means that
somebody in the supply chain is not
making it and it's chances are it's
going to be the producer they're the
ones that lost
at retail coffee from this region of
Kenya has sold for 22.50 for a 12 ounce
bag that's over nine times what the
farmers are paid
but just comparing those two numbers
doesn't tell the whole story
even when producers are paid a premium
there will always be a markup between
coffee cherries and roasted coffee
Roasters typically pay more for single
origin coffee but there's no definitive
premium
the real truth of it is that you can buy
copied at commodity pricing that
actually meets specialty standards for
so long the market has been so low and
then the quality has been so high that
producers need to sell their coffee they
need to earn a living because if they're
not earning enough to cover the cost of
production not earning enough to just
meet the minimum requirements to have a
decent way of life they're going to be
edged out that is what's happening all
over the world
many throughout the specialty coffee
are working towards more transparency
better pay for producers and more access
to research and best practices
ultimately when coffee prices are low
the producers are the ones hurt the most
foreign

what happens when you mix uncontrollable
rage
narcissism
I figured I'd just come in kick it with
you off dude since I'm making a big time
and a loose grasp on reality well you
get one of the most trolled locales in
Internet history hi I'm the internet
Anarchist I create weekly YouTube
documentaries and today we'll be diving
into the long and tragic story of chance
Wilkins AKA Cyrax an online personality
whose enormous ego vile Tendencies and
lack of self-awareness brought on a
never-ending wave of criticism and
trolling from everyone on the internet
cyrex created his first YouTube Channel
DJ shadowblade in 2009 on the channel
who would upload short music videos
anime montages and footage of various
activities like skateboarding or
drumming
sarik's had a different Persona back
then focusing more of the dream of being
a professional musician a dream that he
felt like he would never achieve due to
his appearance yeah I'm 27 and I'm only
five foot three and when I was born I
was born one kidney and one and a half
lungs and you know growing up through
school you know I did get picked on I
got bullied way more than most like I
judge fortunately for Cyrax someone did
try to see potential in him in late 2012
a partial owner of killer Cloud sounds
Eric scrubbler decided to sign cyrex
which gave him the opportunity to try
and make his music dreams a reality an
opportunity that he would proceed to
waste by betraying the one person that
believed in him the relationship between
the two would come to a Bitter End in
April of 2013 after Cyrax had stolen her
for 10 songs from Eric stole the name of
his upcoming albums and claimed he could
do better there is this bro
this was one of the first instances of
Cyrax showing his true colors if he had
the upper hand in any way he would make
sure to abuse that power cyrex did a
dress to falling out by making an
apology video with his then girlfriend
Heather but would only go on to talk
about throwing the labels dog tags in a
lake and never mentioned the fact that
he stole from him man and sauce
listen I know you're pretty upset about
the whole dog tank thing and whatnot
well when we did the whole thing with
the dog tags
it's because we were pissed off we
didn't know what the hell to do
when we were yeah
we were seriously just
we were only doing like my mom wanted us
to do she knew what the idea to throw
them in the lake and at the time it
seemed like a good idea and honestly
we regret it man
yeah big time at the time there weren't
as many eyes on Cyrax so no one was
there to hold him accountable but that
would completely change as the internet
got to see just how vile cyrix acted
when he wasn't on camera on the 20th of
March 2019 a Creator by the name of
Kendall Smith uploaded a video to her
Facebook page calling cyrix out as a
child p word Candlewood attempted to
befriend cyrix on Facebook but he
misinterpreted it as someone being
romantically interested in him after
Kendall rejected his advances cyrics did
a complete 180 and began threatening her
he found her address contacted her
landlord and even harassed her on social
media up until this point only few
people trolled Cyrax and viewed him as
just another wannabe musician that
steals music and artwork but this was
about to change completely as Cyrax was
about to explode in notoriety which
we'll be covering just after this short

before it disappears now back to the
video now that accusations of online
misdeeds involving children and stalking
were thrown into the mix people began
taking a closer look and what they found
was nothing short of disgusting back in
January of 2017 cyrex admitted to having
conversations with an 11 year old boy
that he claimed was a fan already Ohio
he's 11 years old he's an amazing kid
he's been listening to my stuff for a
while now
so Nicholas if you're watching his body
welcome man
um I just want to take the time to say
welcome I appreciate what you did
and I want you all to see this this is
how amazing this kid is even if he was
just a fan this proved that cyrix didn't
indeed interact with miners on the
platform which made Kendall's warning
ever more alarming in a new deleted
video cyrix attempted to dismiss the
accusations and tried to frame candle as
the one going after children projecting
his own wrongdoings onto others was a
common tactic cyrex used to deflect
criticism and on the 4th of April 2019
Kendall decided to put an end to the
drama by contacting law enforcement and
completely cutting him off
the truth because look how many videos
you hour the FBI is watching and this is
petty and getting annoying but the next
video you make I suggest you be careful
who you post it to because the the
government officials the fbis are how do
I put this they're they're really
getting tired of this this proved
ineffective all ultimately forcing her
to fake her own death cyrex continued to
make videos about candle but he would
soon move on to a different Target as
the allegations in ensuing drama
attracted the attention of a creator
that would make it his mission to expose
Cyrax in October 2019 music bismari or
just Maori began following cyrax's
Antics and went on to form a rather
strange relationship with Cyrax a
significant portion of Marty's career is
based on pranking or trolling Cyrax
which can often be viewed as bullying
such as the numerous times at Marty
tricked Cyrax into believing that a
record label was going to sign him
setting him up with a fake girlfriend or
even showing up to his home in a Chrono
Ohio and the lights are on
is this where you want to chance
that's all he wants it I hope you feel
like a big man
hello
how are you who are you this is actually
Marty uh Chance's friend he invited me
over here no
he definitely did
hello is that ad
no no not not formally
thank you
what do you what are you doing chance
invited me over here
oh yeah right he did he did he did I was
hoping we could resolve things
well go and ask him despite the trolling
Marty has been able to uncover the more
Sinister side of Cyrax aside that would
normally go unnoticed behind all the
Raging arrogance cyrix was the type of
individual to prone the innocent or
naive Mahdi as well as other individuals
recorded and documented several
instances of cyric's messaging and
sending miners in decent pictures and
videos of himself the allegations
brought forward by candle gained a lot
of legitimacy since her viewers had the
opportunity to witness just how
dangerous Cyrax really was whenever he
got caught red-handed cyrics resulted to
his usual tactic of Shifting blame
projections and raging at trolls
these people have had National Mafia
pretend to be an 18 year old female send
me a picture and they claim to be
underage these people have made up all
kinds of screenshots and conversations
and used my voice to create an AI voice
clone of me to make it look like I was
saying [ __ ] that I wasn't saying and
it's not right it's [ __ ] sickening
what these people have done in the cases
where that didn't work cyrex turned to
trying to make people feel sorry for him
by playing as the victim unfortunately
for Cyrax this would ultimately backfire
and end up unearthing and disturbing
incidents that took place years before
he had even started YouTube in one of
his many attempts to manipulate viewers
Cyrus claimed that it was assaulted
during his time at high school as I said
in my entire real life I was bullied I
was picked on I was beat up I was
degraded I was hungry for answers one of
the trolls pretending to be his online
girlfriend asked him to elaborate on
what really happened now like
unfortunately when I was 16 17 years old
around that time period
um I was actually
by one of my best friends from high
school um now at the time I didn't know
that he was gay
um I had actually met this kid um his
name was Billy Seiler we had gone to the
same high school together
um and me and him grew really really
close we were super cool with each other
and at first like I didn't take him as
gay like I just took him as you know
being you know that weird kid in high
school that's just like really strange
and like an oddball kind of person cyrex
claimed that it was expelled when school
became aware of the incident despite him
being the court victim on the surface it
seemed as if cyrix was powerless in the
situations but the viewers weren't
buying it he stated that the expulsion
was due to a six-month age difference
between them but these claims full of
pots when you realize that they'll birth
mine is at the time things get even
worse when you take into account that
Billy was legally blind it didn't take
long for Marty to find and get in touch
with the blind Billy to hear his side of
the story because this was during the
night
um that it happened we were up in my
room you know it was late at night I
think I was searching for something and
the next thing I know is I'm in a doggy
style position and basically
my my pants and underwear come off or at
least down to the ankles sorryx had once
again Twisted the facts to gain sympathy
from his viewers but this time it didn't
end well for him he had assaulted
someone who saw him as a friend and
wanted people to feel sorry for him oh
my name's already been cleared dude my
name has been cleared for [ __ ] years
for [ __ ] years since it happened my
name got cleared we spoke to the school
we spoke to the police they know what
Billy did they know what Billy did
that's why they removed me from that
school because of what he did so it
didn't happen to me again that's why
they did what they did throughout his
life cyrics had always tried to
manipulate and take advantage of any and
everyone is ever come into contact with
this toxic pattern extends into his
relationship with his family and the few
friends he managed to make over time
individuals that he claims to love and
protect there's a long list of times
when cyrix has been physically abusive
to his so-called loved ones in February
2012 cyrics was arrested for strangling
his grandmother and primary caretaker
Sally cyrix claimed that he was blacked
out during the incident and luckily for
him Sally didn't press any charges on
the 4th of February 2020 cyrix went on
to one of Marley's streams and revealed
how toxic his relationship was with his
then-girlfriend Heather he actually I
can't even talk to her like a normal
person
[Music]
[Music]
there have also been times when Cyrus
has cheated on his partner by sending
inappropriate pitches to mine is on the
internet but even with that being said
it wouldn't take any accountability for
it and claimed one of his ex-girlfriends
hacked his phone
I want you guys to know that she did go
to jail
Tiffany did go to jail for hacking
crimes
how much time she's serving I don't know
because I'm not there so I can't really
you know say
many of the women that have been around
Cyrax were only there due to his
reputation or seemingly promising record
deal this was the case with his second
girlfriend Heather who left her family
when she thought Cyrus was getting a
record deal a decision that she would
later regret cyrix has never once taken
responsibility for his actions and
instead opts to play the victim card a
habit that he doesn't seem to be
stopping anytime soon currently cyrix
has never bothered to get a stable job
and claims it's due to people trolling
him this becomes hard to believe when
you take into consideration that Marty
has tried to get cyric's job in the past
syrex seems to prefer the status quo of
his grandmother taking care while he
blames people on the internet for all of
his problems on the 13th of April 2023
cyrics tried to deflect criticism by
blaming a troll in AI for the videos of
his deplorable acts and current living
conditions these people have made up all
kinds of screenshots and conversations
and use my voice to create an AI voice
clone of me to make it look like I was
saying [ __ ] that I wasn't saying and
it's not right it's [ __ ] sickening
what these people have done cyrix has
shown that his online appearance and
perceived status matter more than
anything else even his grandmother being
in hospital due to a stroke comes second

so
many singaporeans choose the norms and
pursue careers in more traditional and
conventional professions
with the beautiful game getting more and
more worldwide coverage many youths
dream of following the footsteps of
their idols
but for many years it's been a game
dominated by men
with the start of the fifa women's world
cup in 1991 and professional women's
leagues starting to be set up around the
globe
women's soccer has been starting to gain
much attraction
but
what about the next generation of soccer
girls in singapore is there a future for
them
good sucker is not only
skill wise
but it is more
how they perform during the game and how
consistent they are
aside from that a good soccer girl is
those who have good relationship with
their teammates or other people and also
the opponent
i have a lot of guy friends who play
soccer with me and they know that i'm
the character of my team
they don't underestimate my potential
and my ability to meet my own team
i think that girls also can play as good
as boys just in terms of their
experiences and their passion over time
after playing with my teammate over the
season playing few games weekly
my teammates make me a better keeper day
by day
well in coaching women's soccer i guess
we have to take a bit of precaution in
terms of physical contact and everything
else
uh restriction i doubt so there's any
because i always told the players that
this is a physical game if i need to
demonstrate anything physical i will
have to and
i
like them to think that i'm being
professional
i actually encourage them to actually be
playing like the boys if they have to
tackle hard they have to
to
go shoot hard and everything else so i
guess restriction and boundaries
is very minimal but i always have to be
aware of it and conscious of it
not only do the girls play soccer
they have also ventured into freestyle
soccer
i started playing soccer since young i
have a love of for soccer
but what makes me do football freestyle
is i have a love for art especially
dance
football freestyle is using all
different parts of your body to control
the ball you have to follow the reader
of the beats and the music and to add on
flow with all your tricks together
how does the public feel about female
soccer players there's always the
potential to
train women to actually be better at
whatever they do it's all about having
the proper training proper
amount of uh knowledge and support from
the community if the girls actually go
out with the boyfriend
she also like to suffer right so they
can enjoy together a point of time
probably they are not really playing
very well i think i mean probably man is
better
and
i think more star actually is i mean in
the world right i mean people knows
people in the world as uh the good
soccer player is a man right not not
really a woman i think they can be
really feminine and you know be soccer
players i think they're just a
stereotype just conventional to watch
men play football because it's been
going on for so long and it's kind of
difficult to like shift everyone to like
you know to watch females playing
football the important thing is to get
the let's call the grassroots sport so
obviously all the youngsters playing so
that you can get competitive leagues
starting right from the beginning that's
the only way that you can be really
competitive when you get to the national
team but so of course there is a future
for that
how many competitions are available in
singapore
and how acceptable are they of female
competitors there isn't really any
ladies competition in asia or singapore
anywhere i'm always competing with the
guy so it's very hard to keep up
but what i think i have achieved is
where am i today
for me it's really not easy being a girl
doing football freestyle there isn't
much support here in singapore let's say
people don't even know like hey ladies
can do football freestyle here in
singapore people like just look guys
doing it but they never thought that you
know girls can actually do it too
for girls and guys stamina wise fitness
wise and
football freestyle is actually very
tiring for you to just juggle the ball
like for like straight if you try like a
minute or so it's actually very tiring
and at the same time you have to do
tricks
so fitness levels wise it's very hard to
go on power with guys so we have to work
extra harder
to be on par with them and it's
really really hard but i believe as long
as you don't give up girls we are good
at certain things that guys are not at
such as flexibility so there are certain
tricks that we can do but they can't so
i think we just have to work
on our strengths
maybe because guys
could play better and they have more
skills and girls i mean girls have
skills but they
don't have skills like guys do
guys soccer are
more well known and usually more people
will come down to watch a guy's match
because they think that a girl soccer
match
is not fun and
and as challenging as you guys met
i feel like
for
my students they are mostly boys to
readers because like what i say this is
not a very known sport or art in
singapore yet like not parents they just
send their kids to like normal soccer
class and for
women's football in singapore is slowly
picking up
the number of
uh kids who are attending are mainly
boys and girls yeah cause this is
actually a boy sport like a male
dominated sport
soccer is indeed a male-dominated game
it's full of stereotyping opinions
will these female players get their
support
i don't believe that girls who cut their
hair short make them lose their
femininity it's just maybe playing
soccer with shorter hair is easier than
with long hair you need to tie tie up
your hair before the game matches
the society the stereotyping keeps
continuing the girls they themselves
don't dare to stand up or when they step
into the spot like
they feel like after like one or two
weeks they feel uncomfortable here like
there's no support there's no growth
everyone needs someone to support them
in whatever they do i'm here to support
her and if she needs help i'll be there
for her to boost up her morning
give us and show her some support that
she needs
sometimes she comes my game but
sometimes she doesn't
so it makes us most rusella she can be
manlier than me but i don't feel
intimidated at all with the girls okay
they
actually
always try to improve themselves even
though they know
something already or when i show them to
do something when i
show them a drill or a technique and
they are always willing to
to take in what i have said and try to
improve themselves rather than the boys
because sometimes the boys get too
carried away they
they actually are quite proud
they they think that they know how to do
this how to do that and everything else
so that's the difference
can female footballers reach up to the
success their male counterparts in
soccer
i was given the
chance to lead the team for polar and
also ivp and i think that is one of the
sweet achievements for me aside from
that i also managed to
get
the most valuable player e4 warriors
award ceremony i would say it's not
impossible to achieve awards
same as those guys
what you need is persistent perseverance
and
that will
definitely bring you to somewhere and
eventually
winning awards is not
something is impossible for us to play
software
my coach actually gave me the captain um
man with my name as a book they give
for me to wear during my matches like
and it makes me feel proud leaving the
team
actually you don't have to bother about
what people say
especially usually guys who say that
they underestimate girls who can't who
play soccer but you know yourself better
and you know you that's your passion
that's what you love to do then just do
it so i will always
encourage them to go as
far as they could but if they decided
not to they wish to pursue
their careers in other things
i wish them well but at the same time i
hope that they learn something from me
when they are here playing their
football don't do this because you want
to achieve this achieve that do it
because you love it
there could be a chance of success for
soccer girls to play at a higher
competitive platform in singapore
but they can't do it by themselves they
need support from football associations
and the general public
if we can make every soccer girl in
singapore say i am soccer girl
proudly without hesitating it's a sign
that the girls have started to make it
wow
huh

At the beginning of the 15th century, 
tensions between the Teutonic Order and the  
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth grew steadily. 
The goal of the Teutonic Order was to baptize  
and fight against Baltic pagan tribes. But as 
much of the region converted to Christianity  
over the past few decades, the original 
purpose of the Order diminished greatly.
 
Now, a new rivalry emerged between the Teutonic 
Order and the formerly pagan Lithuania,  
and its ally the Kingdom of Poland, over 
Samogitia, one of the last remaining bastions  
of pagan religion in the Baltic region.
According to the Treaty of Salynas,  
signed by the Grand Duke of Lithuania, Vytautas, 
and the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order,  
Conrad von Jungingen, Samogitia belonged to the 
Teutonic Order. This was extremely important,  
because this stretch of land separated the knights 
of Prussia from the knights of Livonia, and as  
such it was of significant strategic importance.
But the people of Samogitia refused to accept the  
Teutons as their masters, which lead to 
a series of uprisings against the Order.  
Grand Master Conrad von Jungingen responded 
with incursions into Samogitian territory,  
which resulted in looting and brutal 
reprisals against the local pagan population.
 
The Samogitian uprisings were secretly 
supported by Vytautas, but the Grand  
Duke could not intervene against the Teutonic 
Order due to numerous internal problems he faced  
within his own realm.
Conversely, in 1402,  
Shvitrigaila, the brother 
of the Polish King Jogaila,  
and a contenter for the Lithuanian throne, 
received full support of the Teutonic Knights.  
At the head of their army he then marched 
into Lithuania to overthrow the Grand Duke  Vytautas…
Despite the backing he received from the Teutonic  
Order, Shvitrigaila’s invasion did not enjoy much 
success and the army was forced to turn back.  
Vytautas had priorities of his own, so he was all 
too happy to make peace with the Teutons in 1404.
 
According to the agreement, Samogitia remained in 
Teutonic hands, while Shvitrigaila had to content  
himself with managing a piece of land in the south 
of the country – Podolia. With this peace it was  
also agreed that King Jogaila of Poland, also 
known as Wladislaw II Jagiello, would buy the  
Dobrzyn Land from the Teutons. And with that, the 
rulers could turn to their pressing concerns.
 
Grand Duke Vytautas and King Wladislaw II 
settled their accounts with the revolt in  
Smolensk, and waged wars against 
the Russian Grand Duchy of Moscow.  
On the other hand, Conrad used the peace to 
rebuild the previously demolished fortifications  
in Samogitia, but also to build new ones. He was 
helped in this by his former enemy Vytautas, and  
in return the Teutons helped him with the wars in 
the east. However, this peace did not last long.
 
In the spring of 1407. Teutonic Great Master 
Conrad von Jungingen died. Thanks to his  
diplomatic abilities, the Order’s knights 
enjoyed great success in recent years.  
But now, he was replaced by his not very skilled 
and militant brother - Ulrich von Jungingen. 
 
Mere months after the change 
of power in the Teutonic Order,  
tensions in Samogitia resumed. The locals sent 
letters to the courts of Europe, asking for help  
in ridding themselves of the Teutonic yoke.
In particular, the King of Poland and the  
Grand Duke of Lithuania kept a watchful eye. 
Having recently ended their internal problems,  
as well as the war in the East, they could now 
turn their attention to the Teutonic Order.  
The two rulers convened at Navahrudak, where they 
agreed to deal with the question of Samogitia,  
in the interest of the Polish-Lithuanian 
union. The plan was to support the uprising and  
provoke the Teutonic Order into declaring war.
In 1409, the second uprising began in Samogitia.  
By the summer of the same year, the Teutons had 
intercepted numerous ships sent by Wladislaw II,  
that carried aid to the insurgents. For the 
Grand Master Ulrich this meant only one thing.
 
On August 6th, 1409, Ulrich declared 
war on Poland and Lithuania.  
A swift campaign into the Greater Poland 
threatened a large number of castles.  
Weakly garrisoned, the Poles were forced to go on 
the defensive. Villages were raided and burned,  
and the Teutons managed to capture the 
castles of Bobrowniki and Bydgoszcz,  
while many others were plundered and burned.
With the Polish army unable to mobilize in time,  
the Holy Roman Empire intervened, brokering 
a truce. However, it was clear that war was  
inevitable. Both Grand Master Ulrich and King 
Wladislaw II made extensive preparations for the  
upcoming confrontation, building up their military 
presence along the shared border between the  
Polish-Lithuanian Union and the Teutonic Order.
The Teutons paid a sizable sum to secure support  
from the Holy Roman Empire. An even larger payment 
was made to the Hungarian King Sigismund, for him  
to lead his army into Polish-held Moldavia, 
to which he laid claim. In addition to this,  
the Teutons raised a strong army with the 
help of mercenaries from across Europe,  
mainly from Germany, Bohemia, and 
a modest contingent of Hungarians.
 
On the other side, Polish-Lithuanian 
leadership gathered a large army,  
primarily recruited from within the Union, along 
with a number of mercenaries from Moravia and  
Bohemia, while units from Moldavia came under the 
command of Voivode Alexander I, who also brought  
with him a contingent of tatar units.
Realizing the Polish-Lithuanian forces  
were too numerous, the Teutons took up a 
defensive position, hoping to deal with  
one part of the enemy army at a time.
But as the summer of 1410 rolled around,  
reports of multiple incursions into Teutonic lands 
reached Grand Master Ulrich. Information arrived  
that the enemy entered from the east and 
was advancing on Ragnit. Not long after,  
word came that Polish forces were moving towards 
Ostroda and that Bydogoscz was under attack.
 
The Teutons responded by sending smaller 
regiments to check the advancing enemy,  
while moving their main army to relieve Bydogoscz. 
However, these attacks were only a diversion. 
 
Polish and Lithuanian armies united their forces 
at Czerwinsk and had gone directly for the  
Teutonic capital, Marienburg. They left a trail 
of destruction, pillaging villages and churches,  
while many of the “Merits” were awarded to the 
tatar squads who were infamous for their craft.
 
This ruined Grand Master Ulrich’s plan 
to first beat the Lithuanian army,  
and then turn to deal with the Polish host. Once 
he learned that the enemy had invaded Prussia,  
he left a portion of his army in the West 
and quickly activated his forces in the East,  
so that he could stop the 
Polish-Lithuanian host at Kauernick.
 
But Wladislaw and Vytautas decided 
to simply bypass Kauernick,  
deciding that this fortified castle was 
not a convenient place to wage a battle.  
They continued east, aiming to avoid larger 
rivers that would present an obstacle.
 
The Teutons followed close behind, planning to 
block the road to the center of their domain.
 
On the morning of July 15, 1410, after a long 
march, the two opposing armies faced each other.  
On the right wing of the Polish-Lithuanian army 
stood the Lithuanians, made mostly out of light  
cavalry, led by their ruler, Grand Duke Vytautas. 
With them were probably Moldavian contingents,  
as well as the Tatars, under the 
command of Jalal al-Din, the contender  
for the throne of the Golden Horde. 
Positioned in the center were mainly  
Czech mercenary units, while it is assumed that 
Czech leaders Jan Sokol and Jan Zizka remained  
in the company of King Wladislaw II, who was 
immediately behind the center with his personal  
guard. Stationed on the left-wing were Polish 
units, consisting mostly of heavy cavalry. 
 
Polish-Lithuanian forces were divided into 
three lines, forming wedge-shaped formations.
 
Across the field, Ulrich placed 
his elite units on the left wing,  
against the Lithuanians, among whom there were 
Crusaders from different European countries,  
also known as the Guest Crusaders. Behind 
the heavy cavalry were cannons, archers,  
and infantry. Somewhat weaker units were 
placed on the right wing, backed by infantry,  
with the Teutonic camp further behind.
There are contradicting sources on the size  
of the two armies, but it is certain that the 
Polish-Lithuanian host had superior numbers.
 
Since Ulrich positioned his army 
before the Polish and the Lithuanians,  
he had an opportunity to perform a strong 
attack on the yet unorganized enemy army.  
However, fearful of falling into a trap in 
the expansive wooded terrain in front of him.
 
With neither side attacking, the 
battle turned into a waiting game.  
The troops stared each other down from a safe 
distance, standing in the hot summer sun.
 
Then… the Teutonic cannons sounded off, peppering 
the front of the Polish lines. But the bombardment  
abruptly stopped with the onset of rain.
Although not too efficient, the artillery fire  
was enough to provoke an attack by the Lithuanian 
light cavalry on the Teutonic Order’s left wing.  
Grand Duke Vytautas led the charge.
In luring the enemy, Ulrich got what he wanted.  
A rain of arrows was unleashed 
onto the incoming cavalry.
 
However, the Lithuanians did not take long to 
reach the enemy lines. In a valley surrounded  
by forest, a bloody battle ensued against 
the elite units of the Teutonic Order.  
The initial strike disrupted 
Ulrich’s battle order,  
as the first phase of the battle swung 
in favor of the Polish-Lithuanian Union.
 
The second line of Lithuanian cavalry moved up to 
help their comrades, but the Teutons also brought  
in reinforcements. The fierce battle raged, 
and gradually the Teutonic Knights regained  
the initiative, prompting the Lithuanian 
leadership to bring in the third line.
 
Meanwhile, the allied left wing, 
mostly made up of Polish heavy cavalry,  
charged against the enemy center and right wing.
 
As the bloody melee continued for hours, it 
became clear that the Lithuanian light cavalry  
stood no chance against the disciplined 
Teutonic troops. Ulrich’s counterattack  
ultimately forced the enemy to retreat from the 
valley, with the Guest Crusaders in pursuit.
 
Witnessing the collapse of their right wing shook 
the morale of the rest of the Polish-Lithuanian  
line. Czech mercenaries nearly broke and 
fled, but were stopped by their commanders. 
 
But, crucially, the Order from Smolensk 
managed to check the enemy in their sector,  
which ensured they could not be cut off from 
the rest of the Polish army. Their steadfast  
action protected the endangered right part 
of the left wing against a potential attack.
 
The Lithuanian cavalry left the battlefield, 
chased by individual Teutonic units.  
Only a small part of the Lithuanian force stayed 
in the fight to help the Polish right side.
 
Meanwhile, the sustained attack on the Polish 
line was aimed at the Banner of Krakow,  
one of the most important in Poland. Teutonic 
Knights hacked their way forward, knowing  
that by capturing this banner, they would deal a 
serious blow to the morale of the Polish troops.  
The Krakow banner briefly fell into 
Teutonic hands, before being recovered  
by Polish fighters in a rapid counterattack. 
As the battle continued to swing back and forth,  
the Polish leadership introduced the last of their 
fresh troops into the battle. On the opposite end,  
Ulrich observed the battle from the high ground, 
with significant numbers still in reserve. 
 
The Polish army was still in the fight, but 
seeing that Wladislaw was now fully committed,  
the Grand Master sent in the 
reserves to finish off the enemy. 
 
Instead of a direct attack, Ulrich 
decided on an interesting maneuver.  
With his troops he outflanked his left wing and 
drove the attack into the Polish right side,  
which was already in a terrible state. 
The target of this attack was none other  
than the King himself. One of Ulrich’s squadrons 
broke through to Wladislaw, where the King’s  
retinue fought valiantly to protect him, and 
Wladislaw himself took part in the brutal melee.
 
Meanwhile, more Teutonic 
contingents struck the Polish rear.  
Trapped in the massive crush from all sides for 
around four hours, it was only a matter of time  
before the tired Polish troops would give up.
But… around 1PM, war trumpets and thud of horses  
could be heard behind Ulrich and his reserve. 
The Lithuanian cavalry that had earlier left the  
battlefield had returned to help their comrades in 
arms. In another fierce charge, similar to the one  
that started the battle, they crashed into the 
Teutonic line, determined to finish them off.
 
To this day there is a debate about whether 
the Lithuanian retreat from the battlefield  
was a feigned retreat, or if the Lithuanians 
were simply defeated but managed to rally  
and rejoin the fighting. Whatever the case, 
now, Ulrich found himself surrounded inside  
the Polish-Lithuanian ring. While trying to 
fight his way out with his men, Ulrich fell  
in battle… for the Teutons the day was lost.
 
One part of their army managed to retreat, 
but many were cut down by the pursuing  
Polish-Lithuanian cavalry. The encircled Teutonic 
Knights, however, suffered the worst fate.  
All except a few men perished inside 
the ring that closed around them.
 
While sources disagree on the exact number of 
casualties, it is safe to say that thousands  
fell in the fighting, with the death toll 
especially high for the Teutonic Order.
 
After the battle, the Polish-Lithuanian leadership 
allowed their troops to rest before moving to  
besiege Marienburg, the capital of the Teutonic 
Order. However, the castle’s defenses were strong  
enough to fight off the attackers. But many 
other towns surrendered without a fight.
 
A large part of the Polish-Lithuanian 
army soon returned back to their homes,  
which the Teutons used to retake some of the 
towns. However, the Order suffered another  
defeat at Koronowo a few months later, 
and the Peace of Thorn was created.
 
According to the treaty, Samogitia went to 
Lithuania, while the castles taken by the Teutons  
throughout the war were returned to Poland.
The battle of Grunwald was a turning point in  
the history of the Baltic region. The Teutonic 
Order would not be able to recover from the  
losses they suffered and would never again 
be the regional force that they once were.

so when the pandemic started and people

thought of staying with your family and

welcome into the my most favorite room
of the house which is the kosher kitchen
do you know anything about kosher I'll
give you a quick crash course on kosher
come on in notice if there are any
slight differences in a kosher kitchen
than a regular kitchen
foreign
[Music]
double ovens
double sinks
double dishwashers and double microwaves
and it's not because it was buy one get
one free the day we bought them in the
Bible there's a verse Lo Savannah
the translation is do not cook the kid
goat in its mother's milk so when I will
cook my meat I will only use my meat
oven when I'm cooking my Dairy I will
only use my Dairy side of the kitchen
any animal that chew the cuds and has
split hooves can be used for kosher
consumption such as cow cows and sheep
and goats and lamb but it has to go
through a ritual slaughtering process in
order for us to be able to use that
kosher kind of an animal blood is not
kosher
so therefore all the blood from this
Kosher meat that was just slaughtered by
your ritual Slaughter needs to be drawn
out the only kosher poultry that we
would use today is what we know
traditionally our ancestors use and that
would be chickens turkey duck geese
every single egg that I will use I first
crack it open to a little glass dish and
I inspect the yolk to see if there's any
blood spots
doesn't happen too often but I do find
when you look for it you find it now
let's say you're traveling somewheres
and you may be in a place where
they do have kosher or they don't have
kosher food so we'll do a little
research in advance to find out if you
can purchase your kosher food there
um but if they nothing is available
then you would bring your food along
there's no difference between like who's
going to be cooking who's going to be
cleaning who's going to be that's
whatever works for each couple
the main thing is that the woman should
be able to be her natural self what's
her natural self in touch with her
yearning Big Boy what'd you get
yes oh
it's amazing lucky you lucky lucky you
the first man was Adam and he was male
and female in one body but God said it's
not good for man to be alone
so he's he's a normal human being he's
male and female but he's alone
so God separated the female from the
male and God said but don't stay apart
you can't stay separate that's not
natural come back together but this time
when you come back together you're going
to choose the Oneness and so marriage is
actually not a union but a reunion it's
bringing back two parts that were won
back together
[Music]
you got another coloring book yeah okay
show me how you make the circles
I'm gonna do a chain away this is Kate
oh my sister
this is Shayna and in Yiddish the name
Shayna means beautiful
shame
what is that
I did your voice
they need this of their hands right it's
a trophy thing
like the one because she always got some
necklace marriage means I want you
so we don't date until we're able to say
that I want you in my life you're
missing not something you're gonna give
me you are missing in my life
then we we tell a family relatives you
know any you know do you know somebody
I'm looking and then there's matchmakers
in our community there's many many
matchmakers and then when we go out we
don't date for the sake of dating and we
don't have any dating relationships we
meet
we meet people and it's you know
sometimes after the first date you're
like nice guy but not for me you do a
lot of research before you actually meet
you call his employer you call his
friends you call his anybody that knows
his family anyone that and you find out
is he the kind of person that I would
want to marry first it has to make sense
on paper then you actually go to meet
and see if there's the attraction
if the chemistry is there
but we don't want to waste people's time
God told Eve who was the first woman you
will yearn for your husband
might make it seem like she's going to
be the needy one and her husband is
going to be the one answering her call
because she yearns
but what does it mean to yearn to yearn
for that Oneness to say female is not
enough I want my male part
is is to be god-like
[Music]
okay do some tricks
[Music]
I'm gonna try to seal the ball away from
him and I can ready Echo
but the problem is I taught him
everything he knows watch this oh
I can't get it but look I'm still the
father and he can't get it from me
[Laughter]
[Music]
touchdown
okay Shannon your turn to come oh you
tried to score
just try to come on you can do it
oh go
[Music]
do you like playing soccer too right or
football no
yeah so uh thank you for visiting
Hasidic Brooklyn
it's been an honor to welcome you into
our house and to our family and to meet
schmully the youngest of age
and anytime you're always invited so if
you have a talent like you do and
creativity and photography and film you
should use it for the best purposes the
holiest purposes and there's nothing
holier than bringing people together
and humans into the world and whatever
you're at the right time
at the right stage
we miss you all the success and
blessings in the world so nice to see
you again

men
and especially women possess various
organs that are optimally suited for the
creation of another human being
[Music]
the ovary possesses about half a million
eggs embedded in follicles
several follicles and therefore eggs
mature in each cycle
the dominant follicle grows to about two
centimeters and defibriated end of the
fallopian tube which eventually catches
the egg moves to the site of ovulation
[Music]
the egg consists of an outer layer
called the corona radiata
underneath is another protective layer
the zona pellucida
both layers must be penetrated by the
sperm cell in order to reach the cell
nucleus that contains 23 different
chromosomes
[Music]
each chromosome contains dna
dna is the blueprint for building our
body cells
eye color body size arrangement and
function of our organs
it's all in there
[Music]
if two identical chromosomes occur in
one cell we can later speak a trisomy
[Music]
the egg cell is transported inside the
fallopian tube with the help of cilia
and mucus produced by glands in the
walls of the fallopian tube
additional contractions of the muscle
layers help to transport the ovum
[Music]
at a speed of about three to four
millimeters per minute something else
makes its way from the other side of the
fallopian tube
sperm cells
thousands of them and barely visible
they all have only one goal
reaching the ovum
[Music]
a sperm cell's nucleus contains the
male's genetic information through
messenger substances emitted by the egg
cell the remaining sperm cells find
their way to the oval
[Music]
the goal of all sperm cells is to
penetrate the two outer layers to reach
the chromosomes
[Music]
do
[Music]
the sperm cell penetrates corona radiata
and zona pellucida resulting in the
degradation of the acrosome cap
upon entering the cytoplasm
fertilization occurs resulting in
activation
activation causes among other things a
structural chains of the zona pellucida
so that no further sperm can penetrate
in addition activation causes the ovum
to complete its second maturation
division
in this process the sister chromatids
are pulled into opposite poles and a
female pro-nucleus and a polar body are
formed
[Music]
the sperm's tail and head gradually
degenerate into cytoplasm
the condensed sperm nucleus rapidly
increases enormously in size and the
chromatin decondenses
thus a male pro nucleus is formed with
23 unreplicated chromosomes that possess
the genetic information of the father
as the two pronuclei approach both
doubled their dna resulting in
replicated chromosomes
[Music]
[Music]
finally synchrome occurs in which the
pro nuclei dissolve and the chromosomes
of male and female are properly aligned
in the spindle apparatus
[Music]
now the cell is called a zygote which is
the very first cell of the new human
being
the stage of cleavage begins in this
process the cell continues to divide two
cells then four then eight
at a 16 cell to 32 cell stage embryo we
speak of a murala since the shape
resembles a mulberry
the cells are still enclosed by the zona
pellucida
thus after each cell division whilst the
number of cells increases the size of
each cell diminishes
finally the blastocyst is formed
the blastocyst consists of a
fluid-filled cavity the cells of the
embryoblast and the trophoblast
the embryoblast is the initial structure
of the new human being whereas the
trophoblast is the origin of placenta
and membranes
let's see the individual stages in the
fallopian tube
fertilization occurs at the end of the
tube
the first cell division takes place
about a day after fertilization
eventually further cell divisions happen
forming the mirala
and in the uterus the blastocyst is
created
at this stage the mucous membranes of
the uterus or womb has already been
prepared for the implantation of the
blastocyst
usually the blastocyst implants in the
posterior wall of the uterus however
implantation can also occur on the side
as we will see in a moment
the blastocyst floats in the protective
and nourishing uterine mucus
for implantation in the uterus the
blastocyst must first hatch from the
protective zona pellucida
then the blastocyst barrels further and
further into the uterine lining like a
parasite
[Music]
[Music]
let's take a closer look at this
the endometrium has a protective
epithelium and capillaries filled with
blood as well as mucus-producing glands
the trophoblast cells fuse with the
endometrium and a central trophoblast is
formed that will nourish the embryo
in addition
hypoblast and epiblast arise from the
embryoblast
the embryo burrows further into the
endometrium rapidly increasing in cell
mass and leaving a wound which may
result in a completely harmless
implantation bleeding
finally the amniotic cavity is formed as
the process continues the yolk sac is
created as well as a non-cellular plug
that is later sealed by migrating
uterine epithelial cells
the trophoblast rapidly increases in
size with the amniotic cavity and yolk
sac remaining relatively small
this gives rise to the chorionic cavity
and the body stalk
[Music]
[Music]
three germ layers form from the
primitive streak and node
this process is called gastrulation
the germ layers ectoderm mesoderm and
endoderm eventually differentiate into
various tissues and organs
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
in the course of the third week of
development neuralation occurs
at that time the foundation for the
central nervous system is laid
the neural groove is formed closing from
the center to the sides at the sides
small bumps called somites can be seen
the neural groove becomes the neural
tube which later forms for example
spinal cord and brain
[Music]
those cells later become the neural
networks which enable us to think
[Music]
[Music]
in the fourth week of development this
process is almost complete
the embryo is still in the amnion which
is filled with amniotic fluid that has
numerous functions
the optic plaques which are the bases
for the inner ear can be seen
and a heart is already pumping blood
through the intra-embryonic blood
vessels
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
the yolk sac and the body stalk continue
to nourish the embryo
[Music]
the chorion is the outer membrane and is
connected to the body stalk
the chorionic villi are surrounded by
maternal blood
this allows them to carry nutrients to
the embryo and nourish it we'll see more
on this later
during the fourth week three pairs of
pharyngeal arches appear
in addition the upper limb buds are
visible first followed by the lower limb
buds
the embryo is now curved in a c-shape
the caudal imminence is till-like in
shape the somites which give rise to the
cells forming the skeletal muscles and
components of the skin among other
things can still be identified
[Music]
the embryo continues to grow rapidly
measuring approximately four to five
millimeters by the end of the fourth
week
the lens placodes and olfactory pits are
formed the later arms and hands as well
as legs and feet can be already well
identified
the hands will develop from paddles to
separate fingers by the eighth week
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
the embryo is about 23 millimeters long
by the middle of the eighth week
the legs will not lose their webbed feet
until a few days after the hands
[Music]
embryogenesis turns into fetal genesis
in the ninth week and in the third month
that is from the twelfth week on the
fetus already has a human-like
appearance
[Music]
the eyelids are closed the skin is
translucent
in the following weeks the fetus grows
and the ossification of the fetal
skeleton takes place so that the bones
are clearly visible on ultrasound images
by the 16th week
[Music]
in addition the body is completely
covered with downy lanugo hairs which
help among other things to keep the
vernix secreted by dedicated cells on
the skin
the vernix protects the skin from direct
contact with the amniotic fluid from
about the 18th week the mother can feel
the baby's movements in addition the
sucking reflex has already been
established
by the 28th week the hair on the head
eyebrows and eyelashes continue to grow
in addition the eyes open
the fetus gains a lot of mass in the
last few months and the latter go hairs
and the vernix gradually fade away
it is also slowly getting tighter and
tighter in mom's belly
at first the fetus is supplied by the
body stalk and yolk sac but then more
and more by the umbilical cord and
placenta
since the fetus possesses both the dna
of the mother and of the father the
blood of the fetus must not mix with the
blood of the mother
the placenta is responsible for this
it is responsible for the exchange of
substances between mother and fetus
the chorionic villi which were
previously completely distributed over
the corion have regressed to other parts
of the uterus the remaining villi are
part of the placenta
maternal blood rich in oxygen and
nutrients enters the intervilla space
via the arteries
veins carry away the oxygen and nutrient
poor blood
[Music]
the chorionic villi extract oxygen and
necessary nutrients from the mother's
blood
nutrients include carbohydrates amino
acids fats vitamins and iron
oxygen and nutrients are then
transported to the fetus via the veins
with the help of the umbilical cord
however waste products also reach the
villi via the arteries
this allows the fetus to release its
waste products such as carbon dioxide
and urea into the maternal blood
the mother's organism then takes over
the excretion of these substances
after about 38 weeks the fetus is fully
developed it measures 50 centimeters and
weighs around 3000 grams
the birth takes place now or in the next
two to four weeks
you

[Music]
the problem is with things like
Endurance Sports is what you deem
failure to yourself is completely
different as to what others deem
failure so I'm going to get a barcel
owner and I want to do
959 if I go there and do 10:01 it's a
personal best Iron Man and everyone's
going to go oh that's amazing mate you
did an Iron Man in 10 hours 1 minute
that's great but I'm going to be
massively
[Music]
disappointed 959 at Barcelona means
nothing to anyone other than me that's
it the
[Music]
end doing something like an iron man
ratifies the whole reason why you train
do you know what I mean if you just go
out and train then I'm kind of a targets
driven
person I want to know how fast I went I
want to know if I'm improving this year
and unless you race you never you never
know you just go out and ride your bike
for 5 hours well was that better than
last time I rode my bike for 5 hours I
don't know so I'm kind
of I'm goal driven in order to see how
I'm progressing and there's no better
way of seeing how you're progressing and
racing against other
people yeah I've done one a couple of
years ago down in wouth in the UK I was
aiming for around 11 hours you've never
ever done 11 hours worth of exercise
You' got no idea how that's going to
feel that's the difficulty in it really
and you know it's going to hurt and you
know it's going to be mind over matter
for a lot of it so yeah from going to
just under 11 hours at wouth I'm aiming
to go just under 10 hours at um
Barcelona it's quite a big step up
really I'm not sure if it's achievable
we'll see on race day the swim will be
the same I'm hoping to lose about 40 to
45 minutes off my bike time at Barcelona
um do the same Transitions and then I
need to run about 10 minutes
quicker when you get to your adult life
and you get a proper job and it all kind
of slips away and I just ended up in the
rat race of modern society where you you
put on some weight and you're working in
a job where you sit down all day and I
don't remember the process of going from
skinny fit teenager to being like mid
20s overweight looking in the mirror
going what happened to me so if you want
to turn it around you've got to do
something about it and I'm not the sort
of person that can just go oh well I'll
go running every day and I I'll just get
fit I have to sign up for something
where I've got an event that I'm aiming
for
and train towards that event and that's
that's what triathlons did for me really
was you know you put something in the
calendar there's a marker in the
calendar there's something to train for
you are going to be there at 5:00 a.m.
racking your bike putting a wet suit on
and if you haven't put the effort in
it's going to be horrible so put the
effort
in what's your prediction in terms of
how realistic you think it is going
under 10
hours I'm 50/50 as if that would ever
happen I should be going to Barcelona
and going I want to finish in the top 5%
or I want to finish in the top 2%
whereas running a race for a particular
time is completely the wrong way to go
about it well it might be a really hot
day it might be really windy it might be
really choppy it you actually want to
finish in a particular percentage in the
field but 10 hours seems to be a bit
like a 3-hour marathon if you know
there's Runners out there 3-hour
marathon's always kind of
the the golden you know the golden time
that people aspire to and I think like a
sub 10 hour Iron Man is the you know
that's kind of like the Pinnacle of the
amateur
triathlete tomorrow I'm going to do
basically a full- on dress rehearsal for
Barcelona by calling it a metric Iron
Man so it's just going to be 2.4 km swim
instead of a 2.4 mile swim same again
for the bike same again for the run so
total will be 14.2 kilm instead of miles
and it's literally 62% of an Iron Man
hoping to do it
about 6 hours to 6 hours 10 you can't do
an Iron Man in training for an Iron Man
cuz you just kill yourself for the next
month basically you know you're not
going to you're not going to improve
that way so this is probably as close to
like race conditions as I can possibly
get um without completely killing
myself
yep that's
hard it's never going to be easy it is
hard you start to I'm getting to that
point in my life where I might not have
many years left of improving my fitness
I may as well try as hard as I can now
while I've got the body that'll enable
me to do it as hard as I can now got to
do another 38% more distance than today
wow bit resting should be all
right I'm hoping that salt sea water and
not sweat otherwise I need to drink
more
oh
a really bad stomach pains I went to see
the doctor in the morning and uh he had
a bit of a prod around and and said we
get you booked in with a surgeon just
have a chat in a couple of hours time so
I straight down to the hospital and the
surgeon saw me straight away and had a
prod around and said yeah we've got a
slim theater in like 3 hours we'll whip
your appendix out
so uh originally I was told it'd be
about a 45 minute procedure just Keyhole
surgery and then I'd probably be able to
go home the next day but uh yeah I had
some complications um I woke up about 4
and a half hours later and had a stomach
drain in and they'd had to turn the
operation into a normal operation rather
than a keyhole one and my appendix had
already ruptured by the time they got in
there so so this is my current Trion
training i' say the corridor is probably
150 M and if I can walk from one end to
the other then that's great every the
time you think about all the negatives
you know what I mean you're ly in a
hospital bed thinking H well that's it
in 6 weeks time I'll start lightly
training again in you know 3 months time
I'll be back onto you know a proper
training program and by then I won't
have very long to go to Barcelona so
mentally it's it's
devastating
so here we are home again officially an
outpatient we can get rid of
this lose the hospital
tags and here's my
disheveled postsurgery body that's it
I'm never going to be able to do the
Iron Man I'm never going to be able to
go sub 10 hours and that's it and you
just think about all the negatives and
that you're never going to you're
literally never going to do it in your
life that's it it's all over and then
you come out hospital and step by step
you build your strength back so I've
just been out on my time TR bike for the
first time since my operation I just
went out and did about an hour on the
bike at a sort of very sensible heart
rate and actually I have to be honest my
legs felt okay my the bit where I've had
my operation my actual Scar the seam of
my Triathlon suit just runs straight
over the top of the scar and that was
the limiting thing I was going to do an
hour and a half but I had to come home
after an hour because it's just hurting
you have to accept that you set yourself
a training program and you've got to
take it in your stride not kind of
pretending to be anything I'm not you
know I'm not a prole I'm an average guy
I've got a full-time job I've got a
family and in hindsight now it's easy to
look back and think about it but it was
actually good for me because you can
overtrain and the tedium of just
training day in day out week in week out
it can actually set you back whereas I
had a complete month and a half off and
I did nothing
and when you start you've got more Drive
you've got more motivation you're more
rested your body's had a proper you know
a proper recovery and actually it was
probably good for me I never would have
been able to force myself to have that
kind of break without an injury or you
know an illness or a hospital trip so it
it probably did me a favor in the long
run
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
we're here there's the Finish Line
that's it Sunday
today practice the finishing pose and
watch your prediction Crossing that
Finish Line come
Sunday one or two ways it's 50/50 it's
literally black and white it's 10 hours
and 1 second or it's 95959 there's no
like you know if I do 11 hours or 12
hours I'll feel exactly the same as I
would doing 10 hours 1 second you know
I've obviously been in hospital had my
appendix out and thought I was going to
have to cancel it and so on so forth
just go through this whole long journey
and it seems like the last 5 months of
my life have all been building up to
today you know I've got a job and I've
got a family and stuff so there is other
stuff going on in the background but in
my mind all the time it's like oh yeah
I'm doing I'm a Barcelona in 5 months
time in four months time in 3 months
time and there's a training plan going
on and so on so forth so yeah so it's a
big deal so yeah it becomes a big deal
or be it in your own mind really no one
else cares if I do 101 or 959
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
how you feeling hurting now just
hurts 10 to play
10 just need to keep eating
we got low battery on my watch about
half an hour ago so I'm running blind
soon leave the 10 see at the
Finish
I don't know what time I did my watch
batter's dead and I didn't see the
screen thank you so
much thank
youxia what time did I do just seeing
that sign that says like Finish Line 200
M away I wanted to cry it's like that's
it I've done it I'm there I'm going to
turn onto the carpet now and the only
thing was I didn't know what time I was
on I tried to like I was looking for C
and Lexi I couldn't see them in the
crowd I saw one of my um friends from
the trif on Club I high-fived him and
then ran around to the left and the
right high-fiving people I finally saw K
and Lexi at the end and uh gave them a
high five and I didn't look at the
screen above my head either as I went
over the finish line so I didn't
actually know what time i'
done what time did I do you want to know
yeah
9:36 with about 7K to go I just went off
field and just started pushing and
pushing and I had one last gel one last
like en event thing I dropped the bottle
and just that was it just go for it and
that was awesome I got to the Finish
shootting there was no one else in it so
I could take my time and just enjoy it
yeah that's amazing that's
I think she was probably more relieved
than I was that I did sub 10 hours cuz
now she knows I don't have to sign up
for another one and try and do it
again um and they were brilliant
obviously you know our daughter's like
20 months old um yeah they were down
there at first thing on the bike course
and I saw them on the turnaround on the
bike course and then they were there for
every lap of the Run course and after I
finished it started tipping it down with
rain and they were just waiting outside
the change tent in the rain for me to go
and get my recovery f food and get
changed and everything yeah just give
them a big hug and say say thank
you and none of those 3,400 competitors
or whatever the were yesterday have got
to that start line without putting
themselves through a significant amount
of
training you know sacrificing things etc
etc and everyone's got their own story
you know there's cancer survivors there
that have been in absolutely no shape to
do a 5k that have gone I do an Iron Man
in two years time and they've you know
trained and trained and trained and
they're doing it for charity and they're
doing it for a good cause and all that
sort of stuff and they get to the Finish
Line just before the cut off in like you
know 15 hours and they're an emotional
wreck cuz you know that was their that
was their goal um you've got guys with
lesser goals like me that just want to
do a particular time um but it means
something to
me

now I know what you're thinking what's
so special about Benjamin Franklin I
mean he looks like the guy from the
Quaker Oats box or somebody's hippie
grandpa but let me tell you looks can be
deceiving because this rather goofy
looking chap with quaint pair of glasses
on the tip of his nose and sporting a
rather rotund belly was perhaps one of
the most remarkable brilliant
influential and yes even brave men in
human history what he and his fellow
delegates did in this very room in the
Continental Congress signing the
Declaration of Independence proves that
more than anything else this is Benjamin
Franklin one of America's founding
fathers a revolutionary of fiery passion
a scientist a business strategist a
librarian an abolitionist and a
philanthropist he was also a diplomat to
foreign nations a writer and humorist
blessed with a brilliant and cutting wit
a musician an inventor of ingenious
devices a governor and estates all of
this and more all rolled into one
lovable little fat man and then stuffed
into a nice pair of breeches and white
stockings this is the incredible story
of America's true jack-of-all-trades
dr. Benjamin Franklin Benjamin Franklin
was born in Boston Massachusetts on
January 17th
17:06 his father Josiah was a candle
maker who was married twice and fathered
17 children the youngest was Benjamin as
he described himself he was the youngest
son of the youngest son five generations
back now you can almost imagine him
can't you zipping around the streets of
Boston a young inquisitive child with
poor eyesight the runt of the litter but
he was always searching for adventure
from an early age young Ben Franklin
displayed an almost unquenchable thirst
for invention as a story from Vince
childhood that foreshadows the man he
would ultimately become he and his
friends were swimming at one of their
favorite swimming holes when suddenly
Ben began to swim it almost supernatural
speed only when he pulled himself to
shore did he display the real source of
his aquatic abilities now he had
attached flipper like sandals to his
feet and paddle like gloves to his hand
on another occasion he even attached a
kite to himself and the wind pulled them
across the water while he floated on his
back already at such a young age
Ben Franklin was experimenting with
novel devices it would be a love affair
that would last a lifetime
Ben's early interest in kites and an
electricity developed into endeavors and
future inventions that would benefit the
entire world once when a traveling
showman came through town and
demonstrated static electricity
Franklin was amazed and he and his
friends began to experiment with
electricity like no one else had done
before he even developed words
associated with electricity like
positive and negative and words like
battery and charges Ben Franklin also
invented the lightning rod which he knew
would attract lightning and then diffuse
it harmlessly into the ground thus
pairing whatever structure the lightning
rod was attached to Ben's most famous
discovery involving electricity was
performed with an audience of only one
other person his son William
turbulent clouds gathered over
Philadelphia in June 17:52 when Benjamin
and william released a silk kite into
the sky during a lightning storm
franklin had attached a metal wire to
the top of the kite and tied a key to
the bottom of the kite string with
Lightning flashing all around the kite
then noticed the filaments of the kite
string beginning to bristle he then
extended his knuckle toward the key at
the end of the string and an electric
spark jolted his body electricity had
traveled from the Lightning down along
the kite string thus shocking him when
he touched the metal key now others had
previously hypothesized a relationship
between lightning and so-called electric
fire but Franklin was the first to
design an experiment to prove the
connection his experiment showed that
electricity was a force of nature and
like gravity could have enormous benefit
if it could be tamed and made practical
franklin's scientific experiments made
him famous in America and a celebrated
hero across Europe down the road amazing
another one of Franklin's early
endeavors to serve his fellow man was
the establishment of the Philadelphia
hospital to help those in need here we
are at the hospital that Ben Franklin
helped create in 1751 the first one of
its kind in what would be the United
States when the hospital was founded
Franklin shows an interesting logo for
its seal the picture of the Good

soon after his departure from the
printing business Ben Franklin moved
into politics and diplomacy his most
notable service in domestic politics was
his reform of the postal system as the
friction between the colonies and the
United Kingdom continued to worsen Ben
Franklin struggled to keep the peace
representing the colonies interests in
London and parents eventually Franklin
knew that independence was the only
course of action for the struggling
colonists with a heart weary but a
spirit unbowed
he returned to Philadelphia and was
promptly chosen as a member of the
Continental Congress where he assisted
in drafting the Declaration of
Independence and later coming out of
retirement in 1787 Franklin was
appointed as a delegate to the meetings
that would produce the United States
Constitution serving his country yet
again with distinction Benjamin Franklin
became the only founding father to sign
all three of the major documents that
laid the groundwork for the nation that
would become the United States the
Declaration of Independence the Treaty
of Paris in the US Constitution I'm here
at Christchurch burial ground in
Philadelphia where Benjamin Franklin is
buried he died on April 17th
17:09 at the age of 84 he had lived an
incredible and action-packed life long
too because at that time the average
lifespan was only 35 years and despite
his extraordinary achievements he still
thought of himself as an ordinary
individual one who trusted the common
man and was comfortable with the idea
that it was the everyday citizens that
made America strong

the merger between City and travelers is
one of the worst big bag mergers in
history City group was the collection of
dozens of businesses and so there had
been issues with compliance and risk
management the thing you have to realize
is the the merger that Sandy W and John
Reed come up with it was illegal if you
look at simply its share price
performance City Bank has trailed its
other big American Rivals since the
merger 25 years ago the stock is down
over 80% welcome to the banking business
where you have a crisis around every
[Music]
corner time and again you've seen
problems or scandals or trading losses
erupt in different corners of the bank
that have taken the senior managements
by surprise city is by no means the only
bank that has had to pay fines for risk
issues money laundering issues
compliance issues but the bigger a bank
gets the more complex it gets the more
Global it gets the more challenges like
this that they have to come up against
we've seen City Bank have problems with
money laundering in different
departments again which the Senior
Management didn't know about in the case
of bamax if there are problems that come
up you have to ask yourself if they were
paying good enough attention if their
systems were focused on the right thing
more recently there have been big
problems in this it sector where
essentially systems have broken down and
the bank has made payments by accident
to clients time and again we see the
same pattern yes we are back to thinking
about City and this um nearly $1 billion
mistaken payment that they made so what
really starts the latest chapter of City
struggles it's something that's pretty
basic City just needs to make a payment
of around $9 million to a group of
creditors to the Cosmetics company
Revlon but instead of transferring $9
million they accidentally transfer $900
million 99% of people don't pay
attention to this we just see headlines
about money moving and transactions in
fact the the plumbing of the financial
system is extremely complicated banks
are doing millions of transactions a day
uh
99.999% of the time it works out okay
what's unique about this case is one
obviously it involves a lot of money
$900 million
two it's this quirky situation where
some of the firms that got repaid
accidentally had a grievance with City
group and had a reason not to give the
money back most of those creditors a
group of hedge funds pay city that money
back they recognize oh this was made an
error but a group of those hedge funds
think actually you've paid us this money
there's no obligation for us to pay it
back we're going to keep it and so city
is then in this long protracted fight
over around $500 million trying to get
that money back that they accidentally
transferred in addition to that
Regulators investors are asking the
question how can this happen
the Revlon issue at City uh was due to
human error according to the company uh
but it really reflects underlying deeper
problems it was a microcosm of a larger
issue of antiquated
technology I mean for all the progress
city has made in the front office with
digitization for consumers the back
office needs enormous modernization
remember the flash crash of European
stocks last One turns out it might have
been caused by a London City Bank
staffers in 2022 almost 2 years after
the Revlon case there's another issue
with City they cause what's called a
flash crash a sudden drop in a number of
European stocks because of a fat finger
trading error uh one of their Traders
sent through a much larger order of
stocks than planned this really moved
markets in a significant way and again
these sort of things they do happen
occasionally but they shouldn't happen
and it just showed how the problems that
City had has they can't be fixed
overnight and if you look at simply its
share price performance what is very
clear is in the last few years City Bank
has trailed its other big American
Rivals and even now in
2023 is trading below its projected Book
value which is quite remarkable the
problem at City group is simply the
complexity and so you know it really
stretches back to the the mergers that
they pursued I'll tell you city has it
all I mean when this merger was
announced in 1998 it was the Paradigm of
capitalism this is where the future was
headed for the next 50 years in
hindsight the city Travelers deal
created a lot of
angst when City Bank did its famous
merger in 1998 it really became a symbol
of the changing American regulatory
landscape and the changing Ambitions of
americ American Banks the '90s really
was a time of growth on Wall Street and
just in the economy more broadly it was
a time of burining opportunity the
markets were good National mood was
pretty positive interest rates were low
people felt like they were on the cusp
of this great globalization wave you had
booming emerging markets in Latin
America in Asia and really felt like the
financial world was going to become more
interconnected the whole period in the
80s and 90s came came at a time when
lots of companies were combining in lots
of different areas Financial Services
was actually kind of late to the party
because there were rules against
particular types of murgers that was the
time when people were talking about
creating Financial supermarkets um
buying everything from the same company
uh whatever your financial need and city
was the first one to uh to give that a
shot the idea was that if you created
big Champions they would do better and
you know they would have more profits
while also be able to cut costs
Financial Services to a certain extent
trailed behind even though the bankers
themselves were working on these big
murger
deals you had on the one hand City that
had a huge business around the globe
known to be an innovator in technology
and credit card it has its roots back to
the beginning of the American Enterprise
very traditional US Bank the largest the
highest rated what is today's City Group
started all the way back in 1812 as
First National City Bank in New York and
decades later it became one of the real
Pioneers in US banking in going overseas
in Latin America and Asia globally
around the world in the late 90s in 1974
it's rebranded as City Corp and then in
1993 it hits another Milestone it
becomes the biggest bank holding company
in the world this isn't just a New York
Bank anymore City Corp at that point was
a a giant bank that did corporate and
Retail banking Travelers meanwhile was
an insurance company that also had an
investment banking arm Smith Barney they
make money the oldfashioned way Solomon
Smith Barney which Al did wealth
management as well so it brought the
whole giant panoply of pretty much
everything you can do in Financial
Services Under One Roof John Reed was
the CEO of City uh he had come up
through the consumer side of the bank
on the traveler side we had Sandy W who
um had built up uh broker dealers he's
from Benson Hurst Brooklyn he's
different he looks different than what
you'd expect for a CEO and he saw the
world
differently the merger they're proposing
is illegal most Bankers wouldn't go
there but it took someone who was had a
different V vision and they decided well
we'll do the merger first and the
world's going to change for us and and
they were
[Music]
right in 2001 the share price almost hit
$600 a share cheered on by investors the
merger between City and travelers it's a
really seminal moment in US Finance
because it's the merger that triggers
the repeal of glass deagle act which had
post us depression piece of legislation
had been in place since the 1930s
basically to try to Dr risk US Banks to
separate Commercial Banking activities
from riskier Investment Banking
activities when they announced the
merger it was not yet legal for all of
these things to be Under One Roof but
the Clinton administration had made
clear that they wanted to relax the
regulations and it was pretty clear that
Congress was going to go along so there
was a general agreement that they were
going to change this and by having an
actual deal it meant that Congress had a
deadline to act I mean in a way it
almost forced congress's hand is that
that they had had been talking about it
and now they had a deal that if they
didn't pass new new rules then this deal
would collapse and it was this giant
successful deal and was supposed to be
fantastic for the stock markets City
Bank became the first big American
Juggernaut to try and combine Investment
Banking and Retail Banking and it did so
in a very dramatic fashion and it made
it very clear that it wanted to be a
One-Stop shopping Enterprise it went on
a spending spree gobbling up all kinds
of operations and essentially planting
Flags in many many countries the one I
know best is Japan where Essen City Bank
became one of the first groups that
really had a significant presence in the
Japanese Market one of the things that
changed when City merged with Travelers
was that Travelers was willing to take
partial ownership of entities and city
had never done that before so for
example they owned part of Bank hlvy in
Poland they had ownership interest in a
bank in Turkey whereas previously when
City made a bank acquisition they would
acquire 100% And I think that probably
contributed to uh some of the issues
that have happened on the road the
enormity of it and the the difficulty of
running all these various businesses
different traditional segments the old
the the old school Bankers with the Risk
Takers and the client focused people the
broker that was going to talk to the
grandmother who had savings and try to
invest it I mean these different
cultures never really mixed and so
pretty quickly Sandy wild the ultimate
operator uh who had one out in the
merger and got rid of his rival John
Reed to take over this all Isles of
Finance he can't make it work and by
2003 and 2004 Sandy wild he's
[Music]
out turned out that insurance at least
in America doesn't sit all that well
with banking this is not true globally
if you if you look across the Atlantic
the big French banks are what are known
as Bank Assurance Banks and they have
found a great way I mean they make money
hand over fist doing it their way but in
the US for whatever reason insurance and
banking do not grow together very well
so Travelers decided relatively or City
Group which was the combin decided
relatively quickly that they were not
they were getting good profits off
Travelers and it so they split that part
off this idea of a financial Supermarket
with Consumer Finance banking Insurance
all kinds of products you know just
build it and they will come that was a
fail then you had a failed strategy they
layered mergers on top of mergers and
never integrated them you had failed
execution when it wasn't working well
they took extra risk city has had a big
problem with silos in the last couple of
decades in the sense that it's so big
and complex that it's almost impossible
for the management to know everything
that's happening across a bank and so
when the subprime morgage crisis erupted
City Bank was suddenly left with a very
nasty headache and problem which the
Senior Management appears to have had no
idea was a potential risk Chuck Prince
Charles Prince he made a very famous
quote I believe to the financial times
just before the crisis about uh having
to participate in financial markets and
transactions even though things were
getting difficult people were worried
there was still this pressure to to
participate in in Risky activities again
he described it as dancing while the
music is still playing a quote that's
still uh still resonates
today in recent years Innovative
mortgage products have helped millions
of Americans afford their own homes and
that's good
unfortunately some of these products
were used irresponsibly so we get to
20072 2008 the financial crisis Hits
Huge moment uh on Wall Street and City
group is not spared in fact it's one of
the the firms that's hit the hardest it
has all sorts of toxic assets on its
balance sheet you could have seen it
coming right if there was a risky
Venture that was the point of City Group
the point of City group was to get money
from lower return businesses into higher
return businesses and the businesses
that have the highest returns are always
the riskiest and the riskiest business
to be in was subprime mortgage so City
ran right into it 24 hours ago the boss
of the world's biggest bank City Group
fell on his sword after revealing
another 5 billion of bad loans in
America's housing market it was hit so
hard uh by the crisis and it took all
this government money it was uh really
Shackled for many many years there was
years of unwinding its balance sheet
paying fines structurally city was going
to have a harder time because you know
it had a lot of pieces in a lot of
different countries for example JP
Morgan in fact didn't have a particular
particular big International footprint
it stuff is mostly concentrated in the
US and the UK so it doesn't have Capital
popped all over the place so in that
world city is fighting against the tide
and so it's having to reinvent itself
and it's really hard a glass ceiling has
been shattered in finance City Group
president Jane Fraser will soon become
the first woman to head a big Wall
Street Bank City group named her
Thursday to succeed Michael Corbat when
he retires in February
[Music]
City never really has a rethink vicam
pandant who takes over for City he's
also from the Wall Street side of the
business he sort of has a a similar
profile to Sandy wild and probably looks
at the world in the same place the
person who takes over from him uh
Michael Corbett he also he's a Solomon
Brothers person so he's also of this
kind of Wall Street merger risk-taking
now to look forward is is in a way Jane
she doesn't come from the dominant
culture on Wall Street the investment
bankers and and the the merger types
everybody who's run City basically since
the 2008 crisis has been trying to
simplify and clean up and rationalized
City and they've tried different ways
and Jane Fraser is no exception she has
tried to trim back the bits that are not
profitable and she has tried to focus
City on the things it does well so that
it can be profitable without wasting
money she has struggled to make that
work um I think anybody would struggle
to make that work in fact her
predecessors definitely struggled
there's a cynical view sometimes
expressed on Wall Street which is that
when a big company gives a top job to a
woman it's often because a company's in
trouble and I'd love to think that
wasn't the case but certainly when it
comes to City having given the top job
to Jane Fraser it does does raise a
question about whether once again a
woman's coming in as a troubleshooter
Jane Frasier uh was a Management
Consultant earlier uh in her career and
has uh been at City group for uh for
many many years and respected executive
she's in the uh early early part of her
tenure and so her challenge uh really is
that again now that we're like 10 years
on from the financial crisis uh City
group is as clean and streamlined uh as
it has been in a long time uh can it now
actually start to grow can it take
market share it valuation improve it is
its valuation multiples Trail uh many of
its peers and can they turn the corner
on on this narrative that the firm is
too big and too complex and not well-run
it helps that she is an unflashy UNF
flamboyant person who doesn't often grab
headlines and that's very much in tune
with the mood and Zeitgeist in banking
today because whereas you used to have
these Rockstar bankers and financiers a
couple of decades ago
which would basically grab the headlines
and lots of attention today it's very
clear that investors want their banking
leaders to be essentially understated if
not almost shy and focused on sober
unglamorous parts of Finance rather than
trying to gamble or do profitable um
hedge fund trading or things like that
so in that sense Jane Fraser is very
much suited to the times but it remains
to be clear whether she can convince
investors that she really has a new
Mission and new strategy for City Bank
her current plan which she just
announced which is the most sweeping um
reorganization in 15 years is to bust
down the silos I would say the city was
divided in divisions and each division
had a specific operational manager and
she was on top and that would have been
true for the previous CEO as well she
has decided to get rid of that layer of
management and have six different
operational businesses that directly
report to her it's an interesting
strategy um it's risky it it very much
means that she is personally responsible
for the operational decisions they make
there's no she has no insulation if
something terrible happens it's her um
which may be great if she if she turns
out to be a really good manager and and
really good at making choices and and
freeing up each of these businesses to
do their best it could be very good if
it doesn't go well there isn't anyone
else to
blame
when the merger was done it really was a
time of more is more for banks whereas
now with City less is more for these
guys they really need to refocus the
business and um be and show itself that
it can be really profitable at what it
does instead of trying to be old things
to old people JP Morgan Chase uh Jamie
diamonds figured out how to be a bank to
everyone Bank of America has also uh
merged investment banking with
traditional banking so I I think it's
wrong to say that that Sandy W's Vision
um failed but it certainly um failed at
City Group this entire industry has
become more humble and City Group when
it was created was not uh an exercise in
humility uh it was an exercise and uh
arrogance and we live in an era of
humble banking uh and City group is
going to have to figure out how it fits
into that new
[Music]
world
[Music]

I received my first tooth at the age of two and a half.
This was, by all accounts,
particularly late in a child's development and meant that I was also late to be weaned.
I did not enjoy teething so much.
Its unpleasantness developed in me a certain disregard for these heart buds erupting from my gums.
I found biting with conviction on firm objects to be of benefit and suitable punishment for the teeth.
I would take to chewing anything I could get my young mandible around.
Surprisingly,
my teeth survived this intentional barbarity only to be defeated by an oh, so sweet sticky toffee apple.
This victory was short-lived. These were primary teeth and primary teeth are only present to make way for adult teeth.
They sprouted in you.
By the age of six and a half. I had unfortunately now gained a complete and fresh set.
I had no interest in their welfare. I only had interest in the sugariness that passed them by and settled on my tongue.
My first adult tooth was not a victim to my thoughtlessness
But was in fact knocked out. At eleven years of age a pre-planned chance meeting behind the school
resulted in an inconspicuous
bicuspid becoming an absent bicuspid. The gap left by this missing tooth
was thoroughly explored and enjoyed by my tone of fond reminiscence.
I reached the age of 48 continuing to lose teeth.
By then I had lost enough teeth to begin missing them in my day-to-day
mastication of food.
Even if my tongue was now
lavishing in the smoothness of it surrounds.
Lost three more through medical intervention and through necessity
I gained my first set of dentures. With them.
came a revelation.
It was only then
presented with the disembodied enamels that the full beauty of this substantial link between food, tongue, throat and stomach
became apparent.
I began to place the form of the teeth above the function
vetting and analyzing food for potential risk of the teeth falling foul,
Many foods in fact became avoided.
Avoided or mashed.
filtered
Separated and mashed again all for the sake of keeping my prosthetic teeth
pristine.
My fascination with teeth
soon began to spread outside the realm of my own and into those of other toothed animals.
I marveled at their efficiency, the specificity.
These wondrous beasts that had no need to worry their minds about their teeth. They were blessed with
immaculate design. I would take inspiration from them.
I began to think
about how I could combine these specialists points, that perhaps I could improve on my previous god-given and
god-inspired
dentures. I realized the perfect cutting,
tearing and mashing tools.
At the age of sixty-two, I separated the species and sorted the teeth into categories of size and shape.
I gathered my resources and set to work on the construction.
Through my thorough studies, I became convinced that I had come to a combination of interspecies teeth...
That could not be better matched.
My meticulousness
meant that they were not finished swiftly.
But they would be of utmost quality.
In my 70th, the impressive and fair set of teeth were complete.
In my 71st year, I lost the tip of my tongue.

he is making himself a victim and he's
making me look like the liar poor him
he's had nothing to do with this the
stories were horrible but they were true
and he is the one who's responsible for
all of this so we're texting one day

I'm going to friends to study and we'd
end up sneaking into Pacha then I go to
London I go to university it's common
knowledge that I'm bisexual and so one
of the things I loved about London was
after a few months when I made some
friends I discovered Soho and I
discovered a bar called the freedom bar
wow that was just I just felt at home I
was like oh my God I'm not alone I felt
in a way that I kind of belonged to
uh that London was very mean I signed up
at a recruitment agency an international
recruitment Agency for
jobs and my first interview was to be
the PA to a tennis agent and that's how
I got into sports the football
Department's big client David Beckham uh
was going to sign a contract with Real
Madrid when gr Road I sitting down in
reception waiting for my colleague
because we were going to go out for
lunch and he walked P looked me up there

I'm not a player and a big thing because
you know David be from Manchester United

football team said can you come and help
you know you're from Madrid you speak in
Spanish I I could have been a c driver
in Madrid well I knew the city and I
speak the language so I can be really
helpful and he stepped off the plane
this is my first impression of him this
because the time I saw him in the office
doesn't really count it was like a real
life barban C playing up for for the
Press it's who they are they're
Superstars a phased by it it was just
okay that's them because the clients is
who I'm working for so I was responsible
of looking after Victoria that weekend
David was going to be whisked off to the
football stadium to sign the contract
how did you what your impressions of
them nice yeah no
problem
witty big weekend media wise for them
worldwide press coverage coverag and
what were your impressions of David at
the time nice guy yeah they were both
really nice I was in charge uh of

then I spoke to Victoria and her PA in
England and they and and Victoria want
to be the next call is Victoria just
wants you to talk directly to her this
is when he's in asan and so he starts
texting me late at night David sorry
I've been given instructions not to talk
to you directly and he texts me back and
says we don't have to tell
anymore tonight we bring you the story
of how David
Beckham became a global phenomenon I'd
seen an ad on Netflix I love Netflix I
love documentaries I love real life
stories so Thursday morning I get up and
breakfast with the kids and uh check my
Instagram I've got a few new 100
followers and I thought that happens
from time to time because old stories
get published and then some people start
following me so I didn't think much of
it and I dropped the kids off at school
I went to work I work as a medical
assistant in the medical office and Sun
the phone rinks and it's an Unown number
so I answer but I'm at works I'm like
hello and it's a Norwegian journalist
from do blooded and wanted to know if I
had any comments in documentary and I
just said uh no comments I'm at work
please don't call me again and I hung up
and then the phone started wiing again
and again and then I started realizing
uh something must have been said but I
didn't know what had been said and it
was just been shock the first days and
receiving so much hatred what did you
think when you saw the um that episode
what was your what was your reaction he
is making himself a victim and he's
making me look like the liar he's making
me look like I've made up these horrible
stories I'm the one that's made Victoria
suffer poor him he's had nothing to do
with this and it was so awful I think
it's one thing if you don't want to take
responsibility for things at home
because of your family and your children
that's absolutely fine and if he hadn't
even mentioned any of that and just said
it was a tough time for us and moved on
I wouldn't be here today the stories
were horrible but they were true and
he's the one who's responsible for all
of this he's the one who's responsible
for his wife's suffering he's the one
that decides to lie to her to say we
don't have to tell my wife he's made all
those choices was there anything
particular that he said that on that
documentary that yes it was how awful it
was to see his wife suffer so much that
bothered me
why because he's the one that's caus the
suffering it's his behavior it's his
lying this is why I have decided after
giving it so many days thought to speak
if I don't speak if I don't if I remain
silent I will be known as the liar the
one who made up the stories and I also
have a family and I also have children
and they also have Google and they can
also watch documentaries and I want them
to know that their mother was brave
enough to stand up against them and to
stand up for the truth if he was going
going to touch on this time and how
difficult it was it would have been
really nice for him to have said not my
proudest time um you know it was a tough
time for us something like that just
maybe a little bit of acknowledgement or
no acknowledgement at all and don't even
touch the subject I'd never received any
closure if somebody had just reached out
to me if he had just called me and said
I am so sorry how can we fix this things
would have been so different but I you
know I was made to look like a liar I
felt like I had to continue to defend
myself so we're texting one day very
it's getting very dirty very naughty and
it's fun and suddenly um I get a text
from The Bodyguard the Spanish bodyguard
are you texting David right now you text
me stop he's showing it to his friends
and all
laughing I was very hurt and that hurt
and that pain led me to become more
leser fair and to not give a about
keeping this big for him when he's
treating me like that I've very much
accepted the choices that I've made the
mistakes that I've made I've come to
terms with them in hindsight the best
lessons I've learned in life that path
those mistakes everything I've learned
the way has brought me to where I am
today and I am in the most wonderful
wonderful place I could be I'm so
grateful I have the most incredible
husband children family I'm just like
you probably wouldn't have met if it
hadn't been you know
you have this life

One of the most powerful civilizations in
the history of the world, ancient Egypt reigned
supreme for more than 3,000 years.
Settled around the Nile River in northeast
Africa, the ancient Egyptians created huge
pyramids, beautiful statues, detailed artwork,
and a complex system of hieroglyphic writing.
During their long history they made advances
in agriculture, architecture, and astronomy,
and the many artifacts they left behind still
capture our imaginations today.
Before Egypt became an empire, it was divided
into two kingdoms: the Upper Kingdom in the
south, and the Lower Kingdom in the north.
These names may seem backwards to us, but
they were named after the flow of the Nile
River.
The Upper Kingdom was upstream, and the Lower
Kingdom was downstream.
Around 3100 BC, about 5,000 years ago, a king
named Narmer united the two kingdoms, creating
an empire that would last thousands of years.
To show that the kingdoms were equal, Narmer
established a new city between them - Memphis.
This unification marked the official beginning
of Egypt as a civilization.
The unification of Upper and Lower Egypt also
gave Egypt control of the entire Nile river,
and that was a key to its power.
Without the Nile, there would have been no
Egypt.
Northeast Africa is almost completely desert,
and receives very little rain.
In some areas it may rain only once every
few years!
The Nile river provided the Egyptians with
precious water, but also something else, just
as important: mud.
Every year, between June and September, the
Nile river overflowed its banks, flooding
the land on either side.
But this annual flood was not a disaster - the
people of Egypt looked forward to it!
When the Nile flooded it covered the fields
on both sides with a layer of rich brown mud
that could grow wheat, barley, and vegetables.
When the river did not flood very much, the
people would not be able to grow enough food.
The Nile river provided other important resources,
as well.
Mud from the riverbanks was used to make bricks.
Papyrus plants growing along its edge were
used to make paper, baskets, rope, and sandals.
Even the water itself formed a sort of highway,
allowing boats to transport people and goods
from one end of the kingdom to the other.
Because of the Nile, the Egyptians became
shipbuilders.
Their earliest ships were skiffs, made of
bundles of papyrus reeds tied together.
Air trapped in the hollow reeds helped these
skiffs to float.
The Egyptians would use long poles to push
these early boats across the river.
Later ships were made of wooden planks with
reeds stuffed into the cracks.
At first they rowed, but later developed sails
to allow the wind to blow their ships up and
down the river.
With these ships the ancient Egyptians were
able to trade with other countries around
the Mediterranean sea.
They also became explorers, traveling as far
as the east coast of Africa, and crossing
the Indian Ocean.
The Nile river was so important to the people
of ancient Egypt that their calendar was based
on it.
They divided the year into three seasons:
Inundation, when the Nile would flood, Growing,
when it was time to plant crops, and Harvest.
When things went wrong, such as the Nile floodwaters
not rising high enough, the Egyptians thought
it was because the gods were displeased.
The people would perform rituals and make
offerings to try and persuade the gods to
put things back the way they should be.
The ancient Egyptians had a god for almost
everything - as many as 2,000 of them.
There was a god of the underworld, of the
sun, of the sky, of deserts, and of course,
a god of the Nile river.
The Egyptian gods could take many forms, often
animals, and were sometimes depicted as a
person with an animal's head.
One of the most important of their gods was
Osiris, god of the underworld.
In Egyptian mythology, Osiris was a king,
ruling as Lord of the Earth with Isis, the
mother goddess, as his queen.
His brother, Set, became jealous of Osiris
and came up with a plan to kill him.
Set had a beautiful coffin made that was just
the right size for Osiris and then threw a
big party.
He told his guests that whoever fit the coffin
best would get it as a gift.
When Osiris laid in the box, Set closed the
lid, fastened it, and threw it in the Nile.
Osiris died, but eventually Isis found his
body.
She was about to use a magic potion to resurrect
him when Set cut the body into pieces and
scattered them around Egypt.
With the help of her sister, Isis found all
of the body parts but one and put Osiris back
together.
Because a piece was missing, Osiris could
not be brought back to life.
Instead, he went to the afterlife and became
Lord of the Dead.
Horus, the son of Isis and Osiris, became
the next king.
This story helps explain how the Egyptians
viewed their pharaohs.
Pharaohs served as rulers in ancient Egypt,
but these kings and queens were believed to
be gods on earth, the sons and daughters of
the other gods.
It was the job of a pharaoh to keep things
in balance and maintain the cosmic order.
They would lead armies in battle, collect
taxes, and build temples to the gods.
After their death, it was believed that the
pharaohs would take their place in the afterlife
with the other gods, just like Osiris, and
leave behind an heir to become the new pharaoh,
just like Horus.
The pharaoh was the most powerful person in
Egyptian society, with all the other social
classes underneath them.
Second in command was the vizier, who was
also sometimes the high priest.
The vizier was the pharaoh's chief advisor,
and was responsible for approving official
documents and running the pharaoh's household.
Beneath the vizier were nobles and priests.
The nobles ruled the different nomes, or regions
of Egypt, making their laws and keeping order
in these areas.
Egyptian priests were responsible for performing
ceremonies and rituals in their temples, to
keep the gods happy and the world in balance.
The next rank down contained soldiers and
scribes.
Soldiers could become rich when they captured
treasure from enemies, and might be given
land for service to their country.
Scribes were highly educated people whose
job was to read and write - some of the only
Egyptians able to do so.
Next were skilled craftsmen - painters, weavers,
sculptors, people who made pottery, jewelry,
shoes and clothes.
Near the bottom were peasants and farmers,
who worked land belonging to the nobles in
exchange for food, clothing, and a place to
live.
During the floods, when no farming could be
done, peasants might work on construction
projects until it was time to work the fields
again.
The lowest rank in Egypt was that of slave.
Slaves were usually prisoners captured in
war, and were often used as servants in temples
and the homes of nobles.
Slaves might also be sent to work in mines
and quarry stone that was used in building
projects.
The Egyptians believed that after death a
person's soul went on a journey to reach the
afterlife.
This journey was dangerous, and not everyone
would be allowed in.
In the Hall of Truth, the jackal-headed guardian
of the dead, Anubis, would weigh your heart.
If it was lighter than a feather, you would
be allowed to enter the Field of Reeds, a
place where you could live eternally with
no more sadness, sickness, or death.
If your heart was not pure, it would be devoured
by the crocodile-headed demon Ammit instead
and you would die a second death.
Because the afterlife was thought to be so
much like life on earth, the ancient Egyptians
believed that you would need to take things
with you - including your body.
This is why they made mummies!
Mummification preserved bodies so that they
kept a more lifelike appearance.
The process of mummification took up to 70
days.
The organs were removed and carefully placed
in jars, except for the brain.
Egyptians did not consider the brain important,
so it was removed and thrown away.
The body was dried out, stuffed, and carefully
wrapped.
The wrapped body was placed in a special coffin
called a sarcophagus, and the sarcophagus
was placed in a tomb.
Many items were placed into the tombs along
with the mummies to help them in the afterlife.
Poor Egyptians were buried with small things
like bowls, combs, and food.
Wealthy Egyptians might be buried with jewelry
and furniture.
The pharaohs were buried in huge, elaborate
tombs with many treasures, sometimes including
statues that were meant to be their servants
in the afterlife.
The pyramids are examples of tombs that were
built for pharaohs to be buried in.
There are rooms inside of them where the pharaohs'
bodies would be placed, along with any treasures
or items that the pharaohs wanted to take
with them to the afterlife.
Unfortunately, the treasures of most pyramids
were stolen long ago, leaving the pyramids
empty.
About 2,000 years ago Egypt was conquered
by the Romans, bringing its reign of power
to an end, but the pyramids, statues, mummies,
and art the Ancient Egyptians left behind
ensured that they would never be forgotten.
One reason we know so much about Egyptian
history is that they wrote it down.
The ancient Egyptians had their own form of
writing called hieroglyphics.
Hieroglyphics were much more complicated than
the alphabet we have, and used around 1,000
different characters.
Some symbols stood for words or ideas and
others stood for sounds.
Hieroglyphics were so complicated to write
that there were people who trained for years
to do it as their job.
These people were called scribes.
For many years, historians were unable to
read hieroglyphics, but
in 1799 a stone tablet was found that had
a message carved on it in both Greek and hieroglyphics.
Because the message was the same in both languages,
the hieroglyphics could be translated.
This stone, called the Rosetta Stone, has
allowed many records from ancient Egypt to
be read and translated, helping us to learn
a great deal about this powerful culture from
so long ago.
I hope you enjoyed learning about ancient
Egypt today.
Goodbye till next time!

﻿During the late 7th century BC, as the Iron
Age drew closer to an end in the Near East,
the mighty Assyrian Empire was finally defeated
and replaced by the Babylonians under
the leadership of King Nabopolassar.
Although Nabopolassar founded the Neo-Babylonian
Empire, it was his son, Nebuchadnezzar
the Second, who succeeded in expanding the new
empire and returning Babylon to its former glory.
This was the first time in a thousand
years, since the reign of Hammurabi,
that Babylon rose to dominate Mesopotamia.
Following his portrayal in the Bible,
Nebuchadnezzar would come to be regarded as an
oppressive and cruel enemy of the Jewish people.

Nebuchadnezzar the Second,
the eldest son of King Nabopolassar
was born in 642 BC and was
likely named after his grandfather,
who was a governor in the city of Uruk
under the rule of King Ashurbanipal.
The name Nebuchadnezzar is derived from his
traditional Akkadian name ‘Nabu-kudurri-uṣur’,
which translates to “O Nabu,
protect my first-born son”.
Nabu being the Mesopotamian patron-god of
scribes, literacy and wisdom who gained great
prominence during the 1st millennium BC after
being identified as the son of the most powerful
god of the Babylonian pantheon, Marduk.
As Crown Prince of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar
took part in his father’s campaign to
conquer the city of Harran in 609 BC,
where the final Assyrian ruler, Ashur-uballit the
Second, had gathered the remainder of his forces.
The Battle of Harran led to the ultimate
defeat of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.
Subsequently, Nebuchadnezzar
was promoted and began taking
charge of troops alongside his father.
Together they led an army into a mountainous
region north of Assyria in 607 BC.
After his father returned to Babylon,
Nebuchadnezzar continued to lead independent
operations, serving as Commander-in-Chief and
securing major victories that solidified Babylon’s
status as the new superpower in the region.
The Egyptian pharaoh at the time, Necho
the Second, attempted to restore the fallen
Neo-Assyrian Empire by leading a large army into
former Assyrian territories and establishing a
base of operations in the city of Carchemish.
Nebuchadnezzar faced Necho and his forces
in 605 BC at the Battle of Carchemish and
dealt the Egyptians a devastating defeat.
Nebuchadnezzar's victory over the Egyptians
at Carchemish echoed throughout history,
appearing in several later accounts,
such as the Book of Jeremiah and
the Book of Kings in the Hebrew Bible.
When King Nabopolassar died in July of 605 BC,
Nebuchadnezzar rushed back
home to Babylon to stake his claim
to the throne before his younger brother,
Nabu-shum-lishir, had a chance to steal it.
Nabu-shum-lishir was never mentioned in
documents again after this point, leading
historians to speculate that he probably led an
unsuccessful revolt which resulted in his demise.
Upon becoming ruler, Nebuchadnezzar spoke directly
to the patron god of Babylon in his inaugural
speech, saying: “O merciful Marduk, may
the house that I have built endure forever,
may I be satiated with its splendor, attain
old age therein, with abundant offspring,
and receive therein tribute of the
kings of all regions, from all mankind.”
After burying his father, Nebuchadnezzar
returned to the front lines in Syria to
continue expanding what was now his empire.
In 604 BC, Nebuchadnezzar and his men
conquered the city of Ashkelon in the
Levant and proceeded to capture its king,
plunder its treasures and leave it in ruins.
Over the next three years, other states
including the Kingdom of Judah submitted
to the surging Babylonian empire and,
with the help of Greek mercenaries, the
empire was extended into Palestine.
Progress was halted abruptly in 601 BC, when
Nebuchadnezzar chose to march against Egypt.
Despite having defeated the Egyptians
at Carchemish, the attempted invasion
of Egypt was a complete and utter failure.
There were heavy casualties on both sides,
but the failure resulted in a loss
of confidence for the Babylonians.
Vassal states started to doubt the
power of Babylon, referring to the infant
empire as a “paper tiger”.
At home, Babylonians began to
disobey Nebuchadnezzar's direct orders
and even organized rebellions against him.
Turning his attention away from Egypt and
back towards the Levant, Nebuchadnezzar led
his army into the Syrian desert in 599 BC,
attacking and raiding Arabs along the way.
One year later, the Babylonians
captured the city of Jerusalem
in a campaign against the Kingdom of Judah.
Hoping that Egypt would lend support, Judah’s King
Jehoiakim challenged Nebuchadnezzar’s authority
and ultimately suffered greatly as a result.
King Jehoiakim died during the siege
and his uncle Zedekiah was subsequently
installed as ruler of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar.
Further campaigns into the Levant followed,
including the capture of the
Phoenician city of Tyre.
The Babylonian army swept through the region,
leaving a trail of devastation in their wake.
Nebuchadnezzar took full control of
all trade routes across Mesopotamia
and expanded his empire in every direction.
The warrior-king was persistent in his policy
of expansion, believing a universal kingship
to be a right granted to him by Marduk.
Following the unsuccessful invasion of Egypt,
Zedekiah of Judah refused to pay tribute
to Nebuchadnezzar and revolted in 589 BC.
This led to Nebuchadnezzar's defining moment;
the complete annihilation of the city of
Jerusalem, including Solomon’s Temple.
The destruction of Jerusalem prompted the
permanent end of the Kingdom of Judah.
As many as 20,000 Judeans, thought to make
up 25% of Jerusalem’s population at the time,
were captured and deported to Babylon.
The deportation of a conquered city’s citizens
was a common tactic that was often employed
by the Assyrians during their time in power.
The destruction of Solomon’s
Temple and the Babylonian Exile
were seen as fulfillments of Biblical prophecies.
These events led to the strengthening of
Judaic religious beliefs and began the Israelites'
transition from the polytheistic beliefs of
Yahwism to the monotheistic beliefs of Judaism.
Yahwism’s pantheon of many gods was headed
by Yahweh, the national god of the Isrealites,
along with his wife, the goddess Asherah.
The second-tier gods and goddesses consisted
of Baal, Yarikh, Mot, and Astarte, who
each had their own priests and prophets.
The Hebrew Bible would go on to refer
to Nebuchadnezzar as the "destroyer of
nations" and a cruel and mad ruler sent by God
to punish the Israelites for their many sins.
18th Century English painter William Blake’s
famous depiction of Nebuchadnezzar as a mad king
is based on the Book of Daniel’s unflattering
description of the ruler, which reads:
“He was driven away from people and ate grass
like the ox. His body was drenched with the dew
of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of
an eagle and his nails like the claws of a bird.”
On the other hand, Babylonian sources
describe Nebuchadnezzar's reign as a
golden age that transformed Babylonia
into the greatest empire of its time.
Among Nebuchadnezzar’s many accomplishments
were the completion and expansion of fortifications
initiated by his father; building a great moat
and outer defense wall; constructing canals;
paving the Processional Way with limestone;
and renovating the city’s temples.
The beautiful Ishtar Gate that led into the
heart of the city was ordered by the King to
be surrounded with blue tiles and adorned
with images of animals representing gods.
Nebuchadnezzar was exceptionally proud of the
Ishtar Gate, and added a dedication plaque
inscribed in cuneiform that read: “Nebuchadnezzar,
King of Babylon, the faithful prince appointed by
the will of Marduk, the highest of princely
princes, beloved of Nabu, of prudent counsel,
who has learned to embrace wisdom, who
fathomed their divine being and reveres their majesty,
the untiring governor, who is constantly
concerned with the well-being of Babylon
and Borsippa, the wise, the humble, the firstborn
son of Nabopolassar. I laid the foundation
of the gates down to the ground water level
and had them built out of pure blue stone.
Upon the walls in the inner room of the
gate are lions, bulls and dragons, and thus
I magnificently adorned them with luxurious
splendor for all mankind to behold in awe."
Lions represented the goddess
of love and fertility, Ishtar.
Bulls represented the god of storms, Adad.
And dragons represented the central
Babylonian deity, Marduk.
Behind the enormous bronze
gates protecting the city were solid gold
statues and an opulent grand temple.
The most well-known construction associated with
Nebachadnezzar are the Hanging Gardens of Babylon,
which are recognized as one of the
seven wonders of the ancient world.
Legend has it that Nebuchadnezzar’s wife Amytis
of Medea missed her forested homeland so much
that the ruler built the extravagant
gardens to remind her of home.
Supposedly, the gardens were built
on a slope that consisted of a series
of terraces that were supported by
pillars made of baked brick and tar.
A Greek historian named Diodorus Siculus
described the gardens as being 400 feet wide,
400 feet long, and 80 feet high.
The gardens being so high up likely
meant that water was carried to the top of the
gardens by a primitive water irrigation system.
The exact location of the Hanging
Gardens remains a mystery to this day,
but there are skeptics who believe the gardens
were located elsewhere or never existed at all.
After ruling for 43 years, Nebuchadnezzar
died in Babylon on October 7th, 562 BC.
The empire’s throne was succeeded by one of his
sons named Amel-Marduk, but he was overthrown and
murdered less than two years later.
The Neo-Babylonian Empire was short-lived
and only lasted another 20 years before being
conquered by Cyrus the Great and incorporated
into the Achaemenid Empire in 539 BC.
Nebuchadnezzar was the longest-reigning king of
the Neo-Babylonian Empire and at the time of his
death was the most powerful ruler in the world.
Through his considerable military prowess
and remarkable construction accomplishments,
Nebuchadnezzar immortalized himself as one
of the greatest rulers of the ancient world!

i want to play a game across the saw
franchise there have been a hundred
total deaths but keep in mind they
weren't all committed by me my followers
are numerous and their talents have
served me well a doctor for medical
procedures a detective to hide our work
former survivors of my games who've gone
on to rehabilitate others and yet across
nine movies one of my partners has
stayed silent one has been hidden in
plain sight never revealed prying eyes
my secret accomplice today i lay out the
clues that you've missed that spell out
who he is and you'll never watch this
franchise the same way again like or
subscribe make your choice
[Applause]
hello internet welcome to film theory
the show where killer content sometimes
means content about killers today we're
diving back into the saw franchise to
take a closer look at jigsaw's murder
operation i've never murdered anyone
fine then uh let's go with super deadly
rehabilitation racket whatever you call
it though working for jigsaw has got to
be like the worst gig ever you get long
night shifts you get poor job security
you're constantly working in dirty
bathrooms ripping sewers just generally
unhygienic conditions i mean what is
this amazon booyah got him with the
topical humor and just like with amazon
if the employees started to unionize for
better working conditions well we all
know what would happen over time the
movies reveal that at least five other
people or apprentices have been part of
jigsaw's organization helping him find
victims and set up games i suppose
teamwork truly does make the dream work
but for as large as jigsaw's
organization became the films never
truly explain who's helping jigsaw study
his targets and learn their patterns
pre-abduction there seems like there's a
missing piece to this puzzle a missing
apprentice someone who's yet to be
revealed as part of team jigsaw i
believe that person to be none other
than adam stanheit the victim from the
first film and pretty much the first
person we meet in the entire series not
only do i think that he survived the
events of the first film i think we can
then lay a groundwork of evidence
proving he joined up with jigsaw after
the events of the movie and maybe just
maybe set up the dominoes that would
ultimately kill jigsaw once and for all
for those of you who need a refresher as
to who exactly adam is in the first saw
film we're immediately met with one of
the most iconic images in all of horror
history two men adam and dr gordon both
shackled to a disgusting bathroom floor
as part of jigsaw's game you see jigsaw
aka john kramer seeks to test people who
don't appreciate their lives and
jigsaw's beef without him is that he
just sat on the sidelines a freelance
photographer who spied on adulterous
couples someone who has paid to watch
shady people do shady things instead of
actually taking action adam had actually
been hired to follow around his fellow
player in the game dr gordon who was the
prime suspect for the jigsaw murders at
the time by the end of the movie dr
gordon saws off his own foot shoots at
him and crawls out of the bathroom in
order to survive he's later nursed back
to health by jigsaw and goes on to
become one of his faithful followers as
for adam well he's left to realize that
the true jigsaw was in the room with him
the entire time john cramer rises out of
a pool of blood and gives us this iconic
finale
the first movie ends with adam's fate
unclear we're left to assume that adam
just bleeds to death in the bathroom
still shackled to the floor that is
until saw three when we see a flashback
as to what really happened after the
first movie ended we see amanda another
of jigsaw's proteges trying to suffocate
adam to death to put him out of his
misery and this is where adam's story is
believed to have ended as we later see
his nasty decayed corpse still chained
to the floor and both saw two and saw
the final chapter so if he's dead why
would i possibly think that he could be
jigsaw's secret accomplice well let's
start by taking a closer look at adam's
supposed death scene in saw 3 amanda is
shown to be suffocating adam for 36
seconds before she breaks down in tears
and the scene abruptly ends and we know
that this is meant to be a roughly
accurate estimation of time because the
scene doesn't have many cuts from the
moment that the bag goes over his head
here's the thing about that though 30
seconds without oxygen probably isn't
enough to kill him according to past
studies it takes approximately 30
seconds to three minutes to render
someone unconscious severe neurological
damage starts at around the three minute
mark and brain death occurs around the
five minute mark if oxygen is restored
within three minutes then a person can
feasibly recover now admittedly when
dealing with oxygen deprivation mere
seconds could make the difference
between life death and irreparable
damage so suffocation isn't something to
take lightly and factors like adam's
head trauma his panicked response his
weakened state all of that could have
impacted his overall survival but
looking purely at the timing here it's
likely that he was just knocked out
during the scene heck adam went nearly
that long without oxygen at the start of
the film when he was in the tub in fact
to get amanda to stop her attack adam
could have easily been playing dead
which is a tactic that he employed
previously in the game
all right he wasn't great at it but
maybe he picked up a tip or two after
witnessing a pro it's also worth noting
that we never get confirmation of his
death here the scene cuts away pretty
much immediately after adam stops
struggling and when it comes to saw if a
death isn't definitively shown on the
screen then the character always comes
back we've seen this before with other
characters like dr gordon agent perez
detective matthews speaking of detective
matthews by the way he serves as an
interesting case here because like adam
he too was supposed to be killed by
amanda again in saw three we see that
she supposedly beat him to death but
left before making sure the deed was
done sure enough he survived and not
only did he survive jigsaw sent one of
his accomplices to retrieve him and
secretly nurse him back to hell in short
lots of people get secretly nursed back
to health in these movies and amanda has
herself a track record of not fully
killing people off in fact it's more
than possible that jigsaw did something
similar here in saw three when amanda
claims that she's a murderer jigsaw
responds that he's been cleaning up her
mistakes emphasis on the plural he took
my life from me
i just returned a favor no amanda that's
what you thought
but i know differently
you left him for dead didn't you but i
cleaned up your mistakes
and i forgave you for them he didn't
want his protege committing murders that
broke his rules that's why jigsaw had an
accomplice intervened to save detective
matthews but to the best of our
knowledge matthews was really her only
quote unquote mistake so why would
jigsaw say that this is plural well the
jigsaw 3 director's cut shows that when
amanda snuck off to kill adam jigsaw
woke up and eyed her with suspicion it's
an interesting detail to include
especially considering that this is the
director's cut so it's footage that he
felt was important enough to get added
back into the story that he wanted to
tell if jigsaw truly pieced together
that she was gonna go kill adam he could
have called upon one of his other
accomplices to swing by the bathroom and
clean up yet another of her mistakes but
here's the clincher the most compelling
piece of evidence that adam's death was
faked look at the corpse left in the
bathroom that we see in both saw two and
final chapter notice that it has the
shackle on the right foot but throughout
the bathroom game adam is shown to have
the shackle on his left foot put his
left leg in the shackle this would seem
like a massive production detail to get
wrong not just once but twice when
trying to faithfully recreate the first
film set down to the smallest detail
there is no way a mix-up like this could
have happened by accident the only
reason for the shackle to wind up on the
wrong foot here is if someone unshackled
adam and then switched him out with a
corpse in order to fake his death but
the evidence for adam's involvement here
doesn't just stop at him being alive and
potentially nursed back to health
remember that adam's job prior to the
bathroom game was taking surveillance
photos sounds like it'd be a useful
skill for a killer who profiles victims
and then abducts them from their daily
routine does it not so is it any
coincidence then that after adam's test
black and white photographs of victims
become a prominent part of jigsaw's
operation nearly all of the victims in
saw four five six and the final chapter
have photographs taken of them many of
them seemingly taken unknowingly while
the victims were being watched from afar
one after another after another enough
to fill an entire photo album but where
did these candid photos come from
someone must have been taking
surveillance of the victims and who do
we see taking photos just like these
adam granted photographs did
occasionally show up in jigsaw's
operation prior to the bathroom game
hello mark
if you're so sick
then why do i have so many photos of
however perhaps adam's involvement goes
back even further than we've been led to
believe with jigsaw anonymously
enlisting adam's surveillance talents
before he was ever tested after all adam
is established to not ask a lot of
questions when dealing with mysterious
clients he calls himself bob and he
gives me the money up front 200 bucks a
night
i know i was gonna end up here i would
have asked for a hell of a lot more in
fact it's probable that jigsaw may have
even hired adam to help him track down
his first victim ever cecil the man that
assaulted jigsaw's wife and cost the
couple their unborn child software goes
to great lengths to depict nearly every
step of jigsaw preparing for his first
killing it's an important one in his
backstory after all and yet for all the
meticulous detail it shows in the
planning process the film never shows us
how jigsaw actually tracked down cecil's
whereabouts in the first place all of a
sudden jigsaw's just shown to be in
possession of a bunch of photographs
with a file with an address on it that
someone presumably provided him it's
very possible that jigsaw enlisted adam
to find cecil snap some shots and tail
him back to his home address no
questions asked and from that point
forward jigsaw became a repeat customer
eventually throwing adam into a game
because you know he just has a habit of
doing that to his followers but adam
being alive doesn't just explain where a
bunch of photographs came from it also
fills in the gaps for one of the most
pivotal plot elements in the entire
series jigsaw's death you see jigsaw's
demise is basically the result of an
impossibly complex series of dominoes a
victim named jeff slits jigsaw's throat
because apprentice amanda shot jeff's
wife and amanda shot jeff's wife because
someone else on team jigsaw mark hoffman
blackmailed her into doing it
threatening to tell jigsaw about
amanda's connection to cecile
but wait a minute back up a second how
the heck could hoffman have possibly
known this if this scene between amanda
and cecil had been caught on camera
jigsaw would know too he's seen the
footage and if this information surfaced
as part of a police investigation amanda
would have been charged as an accomplice
so this means that someone who was there
that night must have informed hoffman
about amanda's presence but who could
have done it well funny enough this
pivotal flashback scene from saw four
depicting that fateful evening is packed
with characters from throughout the
series paul from the razer wire trap the
guy from amanda's first game it's a
literal who's who of future jigsaw
victims apparently this was just a night
of wild coincidences most critically
though addison from saw two is shown to
be present even going so far as to
proposition jigsaw yeah honey
i want some company this is important
because adam's photography business
specializes in documenting infidelity i
get paid to take pictures of rich guys
like you who go to cd out of the way
motel therefore adam might have had a
reason for hanging around this corner of
town to be fair the film never outright
shows adam but he could have just been
lurking off screen now that would
obviously sound like me making excuses
except for the fact that the movies pull
this trick repeatedly in fact with this
very same scene amanda evidently was out
of sight the first time this flashback
was shown to the audience only for later
films to reveal that she too was hidden
in the corner the entire time if adam
supplied the ammunition for hoffman to
blackmail amanda that would make adam
the one truly responsible for jigsaw's
death in a way it kind of bookends the
entire series in saw the final chapter
jigsaw told dr gordon that he would keep
no more secrets from him i will keep no
more secrets from you it's never
explained what he meant by this they
just kind of leave that promise hanging
perhaps the biggest secret of all stems
from jigsaw letting gordon live under
the belief that adam was dead when in
fact he was alive and secretly aiding in
the jigsaw operation the entire time
jigsaw initially targeted adam due to
him being a mere voyer that sat in the
shadows watching everyone else commit
their misdeeds but jigsaw's operation
allowed adam to actively intervene in
the lives of those he watched in the end
perhaps jigsaw's lessons ultimately
backfired as the one who had once been
content to sit on the sidelines suddenly
started to play puppet master himself
pulling the strings to pit jigsaw as
followers against each other i guess
adam did learn from the best he finds
ways for his victims to kill themselves
but hey that's just a theory a film
theory and cuts
[Music]

nineteen hundred and things in Europe
are getting a bit tense why one reason
was that a series that defensive
alliances had been drawn up meaning that
the next European war was going to be a
doozy to make matters worse there were
several areas of contention that could
lead to the outbreak of said war the
first was the ongoing anglo-german naval
arms race as the recently formed german
empire ruled by kaiser wilhelm ii sought
to build a fleet large enough to
challenge the royal navy the second was
french resentment over its loss of
alsace-lorraine to germany back in 1871
the third was the rivalry between the
austro-hungarian Empire in the Russian
Empire for dominance in the Balkans and
the fourth was the rivalry between
Britain and Russia for control over the
Middle East knowing that a major war was
potentially on the horizon you think
that the great powers of Europe these
nations would act calmly to prevent that
but you'd be wrong over the following
decade in a bit there were several
potential sparks for the outbreak of
this war France and Britain had signed
some agreements collectively known as
the on tante cordial which made them
allies in foreign policy but importantly
it wasn't a mutual defense pact
soon after this in 1905 came the first
moroccan crisis in which Vilhelm ii gave
his support to moroccan independence
which upset the french because they saw
it as a part of their sphere of
influence it was agreed that Morocco
would stay under French influence but
with a foreign run police force 1907 saw
Britain and Russia patched things up
where they divided the Middle East up
between them thus it seemed that things
were calming down but then
austria-hungary annex Bosnia in 1908
without consulting anyone which led to
Russia getting very annoyed more
tensions erupted from the collapse of
the Ottoman empires European territories
this led to the birth of the Balkan
states who by 1913 looked like this by
1914 things were very tense but
fortunately nothing interesting was
happening except for a visit of the heir
to the austro-hungarian throne Franz
Ferdinand to Bosnia to inspect troops
there whilst in Bosnia he managed to get
a tiny bit assassinated by Bosnian Serb
coal Gavrilo Princip the Emperor of
austria-hungary Franz Joseph was
unsurprisingly furious and the
assassination gave him pretext for war
with whom Serbia this was because it was
assumed that Serbia whom principal
wanted Bosnia to be united with had
something to do with it the turmoil that
followed this is known as the July
crisis during this Germany issued the
blank cheque whereby it gave its full
support to Austria in any course of
action it chose to take Austria Hungary
wanted to subdue Serbia either by
diplomacy or by force and this would
almost inevitably mean war with Russia
who saw itself as the protector of all
Slavs for Germany support
austria-hungary made sense since it had
determined that if it left Russia to its
own devices Russia would become far too
powerful to defeat in a war by about
1917 as such an ultimatum with the list
of demands was issued to Serbia Serbia
refused and on the 28th of July
austria-hungary declared war on them and
Russia began to mobilize its military
Germany demanded they stop they didn't
and on the 1st of August Germany
declared war on Russia France then
started to mobilize and on the 3rd
Germany declared war on them too
the German plan for the war was simple
hold off the Russians in the East whilst
the large force cut through Luxembourg
and Belgium in what was called the
Schlieffen Plan the idea was that the
Germans would capture Paris and force a
French surrender after which they could
turn their full might on the Russians
who would take a long time to mobilize
on the 4th Germany entered Belgium after
it refused to grant the passage of
German troops Britain had guaranteed
Belgium's independent since 1830 but the
Germans weren't expecting the British to
actually be willing to go to war for it
they were wrong by mid-august the
respective site of the war look like
this you'll note that Italy hadn't come
to the aid of the rest of the Triple
Alliance and the reason for this was
that this was only a defensive pact and
so Italy wasn't obligated to do anything
and so they didn't so the balance of
power
early on favoured Germany in
austria-hungary together known as the
Central Powers Germany had a large
population it was heavily industrialized
and at the beginning had more been
available to fight austria-hungary was
also there whereas Russia on paper had a
terrifyingly large army but it was
spread out poorly trained and under
equipped France also had a well-equipped
conscript army but it was much smaller
and Britain didn't have any conscripts
at all but instead had a fairly small
but robust professional army the German
army started by quickly pushing through
Belgium and in the zones they occupied
they brutally repressed any Belgium
resistance Germany advanced to here but
it was halted at the First Battle of the
Marne by the British in the French this
ended any hopes of a quick war and the
Germans retreated where they dug in and
began what the conflict is most famous
for trench warfare after man came the
race to the scene which both sides
advanced north trying to outflank each
other and after this the Western Front
came to a standstill
so trench warfare heavily favored the
defenders since in order to attack the
enemy soldiers had to go over the top
and leave the safety of the trenches
they were then exposed to enemy machine
guns barbed wire and all the other
horrors of war both sites would spend a
lot of time and money developing weapons
and tactics to break this stalemate on
the Eastern Front the Russian Empire did
well at first and pushed into Germany
this advance came to a grinding halt at
the Battle of Tannenberg in which food
marshal Paul von Hindenburg
crushed the Russian army to the south
austria-hungary concentrated on
attacking Serbia which did not go well
and Russia advanced into the empire soon
after this the Central Powers received a
boost when the Ottoman Empire entered
the war on their side
Montenegro would also join the on tonton
by the end of the year the front lines
looked like this after this the methods
are fighting a modern war started to
evolve rapidly England was subject to
Zeppelin raids and Germany debuted the
use of chlorine gas mid 1915 saw the
Gallipoli campaign which spoiler alert
ended in disaster this was where the
ontong tried to strike at the heart of
the Ottoman Empire but again defensive
warfare was easy when a lots of people
died for nothing
1915 also witnessed the sinking of the
Lusitania a passenger ship which was
carrying people and weapons to Britain
from the United States the sinking was
part of the German naval doctrine of
unrestricted submarine warfare in which
German u-boats would attack shipping
indiscriminately in the hopes of
starving Britain out of the war
soon after this Italy joined the war on
the side of the un-- tante the Italians
failed to advance quickly into
austria-hungary and so trench warfare
the war wasn't just limited to Europe
though troops of the British and Russian
empires were advancing into bottom and
lands and both sides clashed in Africa
as well Japan also joined the war and
nabbed all of the German colonies in the
Pacific in Australia captured Guinea
late 1915 so Serbia finally full but not
until Bulgaria joined the Central Powers
and invaded from the south the Russians
who had been struggling for a while
we're now in mass retreat and so sonic
lists ii decided that he would take
personal charge to fix things 1916 saw
montenegro conquered the Fayed Easter
rising in Ireland and attempts by both
sides to break the deadlock on the
Western Front the Germans launched the
Battle of Verdun
during which lots of people died for a
whole load of nothing and later the
British launched the Battle of the Somme
which was more of the same
soon after this Romania entered the war
and was swiftly conquered this was also
the year that so the main British and
German fleets clash at the gargantuan
Battle of Jutland in which Germany
attempted to break British naval
dominance they did not
soon after this came the Brusilov
offensive on the Eastern Front which
would the Russians push back to here
also Franz Josef proved that he could
actually die and was succeeded by
Charles the first 1916 was important
from a technological standpoint because
it saw the introduction of the tank by
the British and they were largely
effective when they weren't breaking
down that was so by 1917 everyone was
getting a bit tired of this war stuff
but not much could be done since both
sides wanted to remake the balance of
power in Europe which the other side
could never accept the Central Powers
wanted Europe to look like this and the
on Tom wanted this the
contempt with the war was particularly
strong in Russia and February so rioting
which soon became the February
Revolution they saw Nicholas the second
abdicate and Russia become a republic
the new provisional government there
would importantly not end the war
discontent wasn't limited to Russia
though austria-hungary was basically
coming apart at the seams and in Germany
political pressures were dividing the
country this was exacerbated by the
British naval blockade which prevented
Germany from importing the food it
desperately needed which induced hunger
and starvation in certain parts of the
country Woodrow Wilson the recently
reelected president of the United States
was keen to stay out of the war but had
sympathies to the on tante after some
more unrestricted submarine warfare and
finding out about the Zimmermann
telegram in which Germany invited Mexico
to invade the US America joined the war
against the Central Powers Greece after
a lot of pressure joined the war on the
side of the un-- tante
the late year also saw the october
revolution in which the Communists
seized control of russia russia then
withdrew from the war and after long
negotiations with the central powers
russia ceded this territory in 1918
germany then launched the spring
offensive against the ontong to win the
war before too many Americans arrived a
lot of people died some land was taken
nothing changed and the war dragged on
austria-hungary continued to break down
and most of the fronts were still a
stalemate in southern Europe Greek
Serbian British and French troops
advanced into Bulgaria which had its own
disgruntled population and so it signed
an armistice the British were now
advancing into the Ottoman Empire with
the help of its rebelling Arabian
population and the neighboring peoples
under the guidance of TE Lawrence better
known as Lawrence of Arabia
the British had secured their help by
promising them this land
the British had lied by late October the
on tante had captured the important city
of Damascus and the Ottoman signed an
armistice in October the 30th four days
later after the Italians had finally
pushed into austro-hungarian territory
Charles the first signed an armistice in
about six seconds later the Empire fell
apart realizing the war was lost bill
ham the second applicated on November
the 11th Germany signed an armistice the
war was over in 1919 the peace was
formalized in the Treaty of Versailles
which limited the size of Germany's
armed forces demanded hefty reparations
and reduced its territory to this the
Treaty of Trianon divided the hungarian
half of the austro-hungarian Empire and
gave territory to Romania in the new
kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes
later known as Yugoslavia the Treaty of
San Germain onlay divided the Austrian
half creating Czechoslovakia giving
territory to Poland and also Italy but
not as much as they had been promised
Bulgaria was
tripped of this territory the Ottoman
Empire was supposed to lose this the
Turks refused to accept this a war broke
out the Turks won and this became the
Republic of Turkey with the rest of the
Empire's territories going to Britain
and France the war had seen about 8
million military debt with Russia
Germany and France seeing the lion's
share the war had been started over
Imperial pride millions of men had died
in the vain hope of bringing their
generals and emperors glory in a quick
resolution to the war tactical and
flexibility combined with revolutionary
methods of warming the scores of men who
didn't have to die did so with such a
heavy price paid what did the war
achieve honestly not much it had brought
about the death of four major empires
and the rise of new nations from their
ashes ultimately what were one's
greatest legacy was that he created the
conditions necessary for the outbreak of
world war two I hope you enjoyed this

Is a living legend in Nepal ?
The fifteen-year-old adolescent was rumored to have spent a year motionless meditating under this tree without eating or drinking
People came in there thousands from India or Nepal to bow to the one they believe is the reincarnation of Buddha
He became known the world over
Then suddenly in May
2006 he disappeared without trace until he recently reappeared just as mysteriously
No, one knows. What happened
A Miracle or a hoax. What is the true story behind the Little Buddha?
He was born in a small village in Nepal
One of nine children in a very poor family his mother Maya Devi
Remembers when he was eight years old he already wanted to be a monk
When he was a little boy he used to follow the monks he liked religious sites he liked temples
When he was 13 he left for a monastery in India. His family had nothing more
Until one day he was found meditating in the heart of this forest under a giant banyan tree
And for the next 11 months he remained rooted in the lotus position
Was he real ?
Then something incredible happened
In the middle of the night, some pilgrims saw the Little Buddha in the middle of a fire this extraordinary amateur footage
Clearly shows his monks robes on fire and the young man apparently impervious to the flames
And then another mystery he suddenly disappeared without trace
The distraught believers left the site, which they said had developed a sinister atmosphere
Maya devi ,  the little Buddha's mother found herself alone stunned and deeply saddened
Everyday she came to pray at the place where her son had been sitting
Since my son disappeared, I've been feeling ill it's as if a snake had wrapped itself around me and tried to suffocate me
His disappearance was all the more worrying because Nepal is in turmoil
A Civil war has been tearing the country apart for over 10 years the death toll is believed to top
13,000 and the population is on edge
When our film crew arrived in Kathmandu the capital was paralyzed there appear to be demonstrations everywhere
They are  journalists ! , they're looking for the Little Buddha
Welcome !! the way is opened the very mention of the Little Buddha was enough to get through
It's a 10-hour drive to reach the forest
And a rumor has begun to spread that the Little Buddha has returned
Some people say he may be back nearby here somewhere. I'm not exactly sure where I haven't been - same
Here everyone says that the Little Buddha is back everyone wants to go and see him not for sure
And the rumor becomes fact when a group of hunters find the Little Buddha in the middle of the forest
On hearing the news villagers flocked to the site these pictures were taken by a Nepalese journalist
They show little Buddha talking for the very first time
Since you disappeared ten months ago people wondered about you some had doubts about you
Thousands of people thousands of ideas
Everyone is free to think to have their own mind let them talk and one day they will know the truth
We want to protect you, but we're only humans what can we do do as you like I don't know
It's up to God to decide
But you'll be able to see me from sunrise to sunset
News of his return spreads like wildfire and the pilgrims begin to return a
Winding trail leads deep into the forest and police patrols are everywhere
Stop here and you can't go any further you'll have to leave the car here
There's another ten kilometers to be covered on foot
Most of the pilgrims walk or cycle sometimes from very far away to see the Little Buddha
Hello yes we're going to see the Little Buddha yes, that's the first time we're gonna see him then we're bringing him offerings
And the police escort our crew reaches the sacred enclosure and everyone has to take their shoes off quietly
This man just saw the Little Buddha he appears illuminated
He's a great, man
The first signs of devotion appear aside from the sound of footsteps, it's eerily silent
The pilgrims hoped to see the Little Buddha to touch him to talk to him, but they were in for a surprise
Behind the roped-off enclosure that prevents anyone from getting too close the young man had changed his appearance
The little Buddha's face was hidden behind his hair
Only a corner of his mouth was visible and for four straight days. He sat motionless
The pilgrims were praying fascinated and almost frightened by his body without a face
In the months since his sudden reappearance the seemingly miraculous has reoccurred
The young man has neither eaten more drunk how could he still be alive?
The only person who might have the answer is Prem a monk and childhood friend
He'd taken care of him before he disappeared and claimed. They could converse telepathically
Does he drink does heed
Never know he never eats not even fruit never drinks any water either
So is it a hoax we showed pictures of the little Buddha to been ad Westfeldt a
nutritionist
He says a person can only survive eight days without drinking
45 days without eating
Well certainly
Sitting in a that sort of position for so long without eating or drinking
After a while he'd become paralyzed by the muscles would atrophy yeah, and he certainly wouldn't be able to get up
He'd die for sure
In Kathmandu the Buddhist authorities also have their doubts we went to see one of the dalai lamas spokesman in his monastery
He's a scientist by training while impressed by the young man's fasting and meditation remain skeptical
The public them want someone there here well the power of meditation can them not certainly keep young people going to
In three months without suffering too much
They've been unverified reports of such things but to never move to never eat to never drink
No, I think that's impossible as I see admit I saw a particular
Me family - no I said pussy
Well perhaps Little Buddha has been eating and stretching his legs at nighttime
It's hard to know for sure
After sunset monks guard him and prevent anyone from getting close
Even the military are told to move off and would not dare to challenge the monks Authority
People we're not authorized to leave the soldiers on duty at nighttime. I don't know what's going on
Anyway, I can't understand how a man can stay like that without moving
And then there's the financial implication because the pilgrims always leave some offering
The small amounts of money left as gifts add up to six hundred thousand rupees
About twenty thousand dollars the money will continue to pour in with the return of the Little Buddha
hundreds of thousands of pilgrims are expected
The welcoming committee is planning to expand the rope to enclosure around the young man I
Hope there'll be enough rope
The sacrosanct area around Little Buddha has doubled in size
He said also himself and
Now you know those tracks all over the Nepal, but if it is running
Everything is hopping
Then it will be very rush
The money left by the pilgrims will be used to build a temple in honor of the Little Buddha
But lately construction has ground to a standstill
The government has confiscated the money until they have made sure that the Little Buddha story is not a charade
The further however is far from being extinguished
The young man promises to follow in the steps of Buddha his guiding light and to meditate for six years
Which means he has another four years of immobility?
ahead of him
You

suffocating loop it's endless
overwhelming
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
I can't breathe
does anyone even know what I'm going

do they even care
[Music]
sometimes it's hard to find the right
words

they are hard to say if you look deep in
my eyes you would have noticed the pain
I'm trying to hide

I'm not worth anyone's worry a mine is a
mess
I can't control
I can't let his show
sometimes my heart beats so fast I can't
even feel the beating at all I feel like
I'm losing myself
and then all of a sudden I feel nothing
to be honest it's hard to be vulnerable
when you thought it was happy some days
I wake up praying for the day to be over
it's life even worth living in these
moments
[Laughter]
[Music]
the questions are endless the answers
are non-existent and just when my mind
spiral attempts to throw me off the edge
I force myself to be still close my eyes
breathe in breathe out
be still
you
[Music]
for so long I thought that these burdens
were my responsibility to care
your burden fatigue loneliness anxiety
depression
it's not your weight to carry
my feelings tell me that existing is
overwhelming but my thoughts do not home
and I do not owe them
[Music]
I am done being chained to the things
that depression wants me to believe
feelings fade but the truth does not my
feelings and darkness tell me that there
is no way out but the light shows me
differently
days will be brighter days will be dark
healing is a process and processes take
time
[Music]
now these are the truths that I hold on
to
exist in the realm of control that you
were made to
stop attempting to control things you
have no power over
don't neglect your feelings but don't
let feelings dictate what is true
let go of what destroys you ask for help
on you do what is good for you
even when you don't feel like it
give yourself a break you are not less
than because of what you feel you are
not your pain
you are what you make of it
light has found a way through my pain
every single time
so now we'll choose to not fight the
darkness I choose to seek the light the
sadness will come the disappointment
will come the pain will come but that
doesn't mean I have to let it destroy me
no matter how happy someone may seem
they have moments when they question it
they can go on no matter how confident
someone may look there are times when
they feel unsure and insecure and no
matter how strong someone may appear
they have days when they feel like
they're falling apart
never think for a moment you're alone in
your struggles you're not a mess you're
human everyone has a story but I won't
let this define life
pain doesn't prevent purpose it reveals
it so now in my darkest moments I will
choose to see the truth and I will
choose to just be be still and on the
truth be still and know be still
just be me

criticality accidents are a technician's
worst nightmare
although a rare occurrence they can and
do happen
and can result in severe radiological
exposure
and an expensive cleanup process an
event would unfold in the russian
federation in 1997
and would have some similarities to two
of the most
infamous criticality accidents those
being the deaths linked to the demon
core
although not identical the accidental
prompt criticality of some fissile
material due to accidental dropping of a
reflector
does sound familiar to louis slotten's
exposure
the accident would result in a dead very
experienced technician
and a six and a half day excursion
i'm going to rate this event here four
on my painted plane difficult disaster
scale
this is due to the event being
relatively localized and didn't result
in significant contamination
sarov is a city in nishni novgorod
oblast russia
originally founded in 1691 but our story
starts quite a while after that
in 1946 the town became a closed city
and it was removed from all
unclassified maps the reason was well
but it found itself the center of the
soviet nuclear weapons industry the all
union scientific research institute of
experimental physics
was set up in the town which was a
nuclear weapons design facility
the institute over the years had set up
testing grounds
and hundreds of experimental facilities
leading it to become
the country's largest research and
development organization
as a quick side note the city became
twinned with los alamos in the early 90s
post-collapse of the ussr the nuclear
center was still the heartbeat to the
russian nuclear industry
conducting experimental studies in the
fields of physics
radiobiology and the health effects of
radiation
set over 12 facilities one of the
purpose-built facilities was the
critical assembly
which was designed to be an experimental
tool to study fission reactions
relevant for design and development of
power research and impulse reactors
the assembly was placed on a cart on
tracks inside a room
surrounded by concrete walls with a
separate control room
there are also other rooms for storage
and workshops
and each room had air samplers and
detectors for measuring
gamma radiation the critical assembly
was essentially a piece of fissile
material
surrounded by two reflectors although
the actual implementation was a little
more complicated
the assembly had the ability to move the
fissile material
inside a half sphere reflector up and
down
through the use of hydraulic pressure
towards or further away from a fixed
upper half sphere reflector for the
construction of the assembly
thorough calculations are used to ensure
the fissile material remains subcritical
the construction process involves
successive layering of various materials
including copper steel and uranium which
are prepared in the form of sets of
machined
hemispherical shells of standard sizes
which the technician can assemble into
various configurations
the process was broken into two parts
first constructing the lower half of the
critical assembly
then the second top half below half of
the research assembly
is constructed on a table that can move
vertically up and down using hydraulics
for the first part the table had to be
in the up position
during construction of the assembly but
the second part
the lower assembly is lowered and the
upper part is placed on a stand
consisting of a ring
where it can be positioned horizontally
over the lower part of the system
once the whole assembly is constructed
the operator is then meant to go to the
control room to undertake the experiment
also i should say that during the
construction process it's meant to be a
two-person job
the operator and a supervisor who should
be double checking
all of the work during the experiments
the assembly was essentially a small
fast reactor
that can regulate itself in a rather
clever way if the mathematics are
correct
then as the assembly heats up the
materials expand
reducing the effect of the reflectors
and as it cools down
the components return to their previous
position the behavior is seen as
sharp fluctuations of the measured
neutron flux which stabilizes after
several cycles
after which the critical assembly
operates at a constant level of neutron
yield
sensors placed inside the assembly room
tell the operators the state of the
materials
which allows them to move up and down
the lower sphere to change the power
levels
if the assembly went out of control it
would melt thus ending the chain
reaction
and was an important safety feature all
experiments using the assembly were
strictly controlled
via regulatory and technical framework
set out by the russian federation
ministry for atomic energy
the procedures precisely outline the
management requirements for work
with critical assemblies they require
that this type of work be conducted
only by a group of trained technicians
with each person being responsible for
strictly defined actions
within a sequence of operations which
are closely supervised
obviously this is important as a mistake
can result in a criticality event
which you know is not great but we can
probably predict what is going to happen
next
roll on the morning of the 17th of june
1997
a 41 year old male named alexander
zakharov
set to recreate a 1972 experiment using
uranium with a copper reflector assembly
a technician was a very experienced
worker with several hundred experiments
under his belt
he was familiar with the process for the
particular assembly
but contrary to the rules he was working
alone in the hall
zakharov had also broken another rule
and that was by not properly filling out
the appropriate paperwork for the
experiment
he had taken the dimensions for all of
the components from the original 1972
logbook
but he had mistakenly written down the
wrong outside diameter
instead of 205 millimeters he noted 265
millimeters
at 10 50 am whilst placing the upper
reflector on its stand above the fissile
material
it slipped from the technician's rubber
gloved hand and
fell onto the lower part of the assembly
this sent the subcritical assembly
prompt critical and a blue flash of
light
and a heat wave was experienced the
lower part of the assembly was ejected
downwards
into the bottom of the stand knowing his
mistake
zacharov fled the room and reported to
his superiors
explaining the situation he claimed to
have received
more than a fatal dose initially he was
conscious but within minutes his
exposure began to take its effect
the radiation protection personnel
performed an initial radiological survey
of the technician
this detected the neutron induced gamma
radiation emitted by radionuclides
in his body it was estimated that he had
received a whole body dose of 10 grey
for comparison
between 4 and 6 grey whole body dose has
been lethal before
zakharov was sent to hospital for
treatment
arriving at sarav occupational medical
service
at 11 45 in the morning on the 17th of
june
by this time he was experiencing nausea
and he began to vomit
increasing in frequency over the
following two hours
the sickness was lessened by 2pm by
antimetic drugs
the situation was looking pretty dire as
his condition deteriorated
it was decided in the evening that he be
transferred for specialist care in
moscow
he was admitted to the clinical
department of the institute of
biophysics
in the ministry of health at 9pm he was
fully conscious but his fatigue and
headache
were persistent his hands showed signs
of severe exposure
they would become severely swollen
during the first night between the 17th
and the 18th of june
on the morning of the 18th june the
patient's general state was evaluated as
critical
and getting worse by the hour his hand
injuries continued to worsen
with the spreading of the swelling over
more areas of the forearms
on the 19th of june the condition of
zacharov was dire
by 2 pm x-rays showed fluid on the lungs
and his arms were deteriorating rapidly
later on in the day the decision to
amputate both arms was taken
and the surgery was performed around 4
pm initially his condition was stable
but
sadly not for long at 2 45 in the
morning of the 20th of june 1997
his blood pressure dropped dramatically
and at 3 20 in the morning
around 66 hours after exposure the
patient died
but what happened to the critical
assembly after zacharov left the room
and was taken to hospital
as the technician passed away in the
early hours of the 20th of june
the chain reaction would still be
ongoing
back to 10 50 in the morning on the 17th
of june
the specialists arriving at the accident
facility
had to determine the status of the
critical assembly
and the possible consequences of the
accident at 11am
evacuation of all staff from the
building where the accident had occurred
and a radiation survey outside the
building was carried out
by the early afternoon it was confirmed
that there was no airborne or surface
contamination
but the assembly was still emitting
significant neutron and gamma radiation
which would preclude anyone from
entering the room all but the dosameter
furthest away from the experiment showed
readings
off the scale another meter was entered
into the room
and showed the neutron flux was stable
hinting at the chain reaction
being self-regulating obviously the
chain reaction had to be stopped
and this necessitated altering the
assembly remotely
the first step taken was to remove
containers of nuclear materials
which had not been used in the
construction of the assembly this was
conducted by using a robot
once complete the same robot was used to
alter the assembly
at 12 45 in the morning of the 24th of
june 1997
when a vacuum gripper was used to remove
most of the assembly from the sand
leaving only the outermost lower copper
hemis shell
in place the remainder of the assembly
was disassembled bringing an end to the
incident
during the excursion the radiation
monitors in other rooms of the facility
showed normal levels
but a technician's personal dosameter
red
and neutron exposure of 45 grey
and a gamma dose of 3.5 gray
it was thought that the uranium had
reached temperatures
of up to 865 degrees centigrade during
the excursion
because the accident was solely down to
zacharov and his infringement of the
rules set out by the facility
although his death is a tragic accident
some comfort can be taken
that no one else received elevated
radiation doses
although the iaea found the rules of the
facility to be adequate
they still did not prevent the accident
after the accident
experiments with the test rig were
stopped to implement safety upgrades
to the research operations

1894 nicholas ii has just been coronated
as the emperor of russia before
continuing there's a technical matter
which needs to be resolved the calendar
to simplify the russian calendar was
thirteen days behind the gregorian
calendar in use today which is why some
things like the october revolution are
said to have occurred in november for
this episode both calendars will be used
so nicholas ii was an absolute monarch
which meant that he had the final say on
everything concerning the russian empire
which was huge during the late 19th
century russia had seen rapid
industrialization alongside this came
new ideas such as the communist ideas of
a certain karl marx which led to the
working class of russia demanding
greater representation so to grossly
oversimplify communism is a political
ideology which argues that the means of
production such as factories should be
collectively owned by everyone as
opposed to individuals it wanted to
abolish social classes and believe that
the economy should be entirely
controlled by the central government the
Imperial Russian government suffered
from being somewhat distant and
incompetent for example agriculture was
slow to industrialized and there were
numerous foreign policy failings the
most notable of these failings were the
ones which caused conflict with the
Japanese leading to the 1904
russo-japanese war so to simplify the
reasons for war can largely be chalked
up to Japan expanding its influence in
Korea and Russia refusing to accept it
Japanese decided the war would settle it
and so launched a sneak attack against
the Russian fleet in Port Arthur which
Russia had leased from China the
Japanese would continue with a string of
victories such as the Battle of Mactan
and the Battle of Tsushima this
embarrassed the Russians and during
peace negotiations led by certain Sergei
Vitter Russia lost Port Arthur in half
of here unfortunately for Russia
military defeat wasn't their only
problem at this time the most notable
event was called Bloody Sunday in which
a priest called father gap on led a
procession through Russia's capital st.
Petersburg to present a petition to the
Emperor
the crowd was fired upon leading to
hundreds of deaths which then caused
riots across the Empire Veta was tasked
with ending the rioting and presented a
compromise the formation of political
parties and an elected assembly called
the Duma for the record this tumor was
mostly useless into had no Authority
nicholas ii could still do whatever he
wanted there were some elections than
the Emperor appointed a new prime
minister piata still even still even
would bring about much-needed
agricultural reform before being
assassinated in a theater in 1911 in
front of the Emperor 1914 was a big year
for Russia since Saint Petersburg was
renamed
to Petrograd because it sounded more
Russian another event which was also
probably important was the first world
war in which Russia had mixed success to
raise morale and against the advice of
literally everyone Nikolas appointed
himself as the head of the army he left
his wife Empress Alexandra in charge of
the capital with her advisor grigori
rasputin after Russia's failings on the
Eastern Front Rasputin was blamed for
corrupting the royal family was
eventually assassinated in 1916 Nikolas
as the head of the army was seen as
responsible for the failings of the war
war fatigue and food shortages led to
protests which Nikolas had hoped to put
down with the army well the army needs
an Eden joined the protesters in order
to calm the situation some Russian
generals met with Nikolas and urged him
to abdicate which he did in 1917
Nicholas his application led to certain
exiled people's most notably Vladimir
Lenin returning to Russia it was people
like Lenin who undermined the new
provisional government by forming a
rival one the Petrograd Soviet Lenin
immediately began calling for the
overthrow of the provisional government
promising the Russian people land food
and an end to the war the provisional
government had decided not to end the
war and many people took to the streets
to protest in at the front of this
protest at Lenin's communist faction
called the Bolsheviks the government
forces decided to open fire and many
prominent Bolsheviks such as Leon
Trotsky were arrested and Lenin was
forced to flee to Finland Trotsky
wouldn't spend long in prison since the
new Russian Prime Minister Alexander
Kerensky appointed a new head of the
army Livia Kornilov Kerensky in corner
love quickly fell out and corner love
marched his troops on Petrograd
Kerensky released many of the Bolsheviks
since their military arm the Red Guard
were the only ones that could stop
Cornell of Cornell off never reached
Petrograd due to Bolshevik sabotage and
was later arrested let him return to
Russia and in a shocking turn of events
called for the overthrow of the
government this time the overthrow was
to be violent Lenin place Trotsky in
command of the revolution the Bolsheviks
seized city infrastructure Kerensky fled
and shortly afterwards the Bolsheviks
seized the Winter Palace the seat of the
Russian government
Lenin then declared to the Petrograd
Soviet that the Bolsheviks were now in
control and Trotsky dismissed their
opponents immediately after the
Revolution Lenin announced three decrees
there was the decree on peace which
promised to put an end to the war the
decree on land which abolished private
land ownership and allowed peasants to
divide land amongst themselves and the
decree on workers which introduced a
minimum wage Lenin also brought in
universal health care and education
increased the rights of women alongside
accepting Finland's Declaration of
Independence
the Bolsheviks announced that there
would be free and fair elections the
next month which the Bolsheviks lost
this was not what Lenin had planned so
he ordered the red car to shut down the
elected assembly and had himself placed
in charge Moscow was declared Russia's
new captain Leyland switched to the
Gregorian calendar in the March of 1918
after some tough negotiations and an
invasion Trotsky and team of delegates
managed to secure humiliating peace with
the Central Powers this treaty the
Treaty of brest-litovsk evap all of this
territory to Germany in the
austro-hungarian Empire although they
themselves would be forced to give this
up in the Treaty of Versailles to many
in Russia this peace was long overdue
two others such as the Czechoslovakian
legion it was a complete betrayal the
Czechoslovakian legion had fought for
Russia in the First World War in return
for Czechoslovakian independence from
the austro-hungarian Empire after peace
was declared they revolted their initial
success spurred other enemies of the
Bolsheviks to take up arms as well thus
beginning the Russian Civil War in
earnest in terms of the factions the
Bolsheviks and their supporters are
called the Reds those who opposed them
are known as the whites Britain France
Japan and the United States elected to
intervene on the side of the whites it
was mostly to reopen the Eastern Front
against Germany but there was also a
great worry about the spread of
communism the whites were initially very
successful but it wasn't long before
their progress stalled this was because
they weren't very unified and many of
those fighting against the Bolsheviks
were fighting for their own independence
not to restore the Russian Empire the
white generals were also somewhat
useless for example alexander kolchak
struggled to keep his officer sober
insulted his allies and executed tens of
thousands of people turning them to the
Bolshevik cause he did manage to capture
a quatre in vogue where the former
Emperor was being held
the Bolsheviks didn't want the Emperor
to fall into enemy hands and so he and
his family were executed on July the
17th 1918 the Reds had the advantage of
geography their territory was much more
compact and had greater levels of
industrialization it had better
infrastructure lines of communication
raw materials and a larger population to
maintain order in this area the
Bolsheviks began what is called the Red
Terror this involves sending dissidents
to work camps shooting protesters and
Trotsky holding the families of generals
hostage so they'd stay loyal eventually
it became clear to the Allies that the
Bolsheviks were going to win the Allies
withdrew in the Czechoslovakian Legion
returned to Czechoslovakia which was
independent by then anyway the collapse
of the Russian and austro-hungarian
empires meant that many peoples in
Eastern Europe were looking to establish
their own nation
and borders the polish led by Yosef
pazsitzky wanted to expand the newly
independent Poland at the cost of Russia
at the same time the Bolsheviks were
also looking to spread communism to
their neighbors and recon-car Russia's
old territories the Bolsheviks also
believed that the turmoil in Germany in
the former austro-hungarian Empire meant
that communist governments could be set
up there as well in 1919 the Polish
invaded Ukraine in capture Kiev the
Bolsheviks counter-attacked and forced
the Polish all the way back to Warsaw
the Polish repulsed the attack thus
maintaining their independence and
stopping Bolshevik forces from entering
Germany these borders were established
with Ukraine and Belarus becoming
socialist republics which were
essentially Russian puppet States having
failed to spread communism to Eastern
Europe for now the Bolsheviks moved to
secure their position in Russia Lenin
turned to fixing Russia's economic woes
by implementing the new economic policy
this allowed some private enterprise a
distinctly non Bolshevik idea to help
revitalize the economy in 1922 Russia
and its surrounding Socialist Republics
which were nothing more than puppets
States agreed to form the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics Lenin had
become a welder in the early 1920s and
after a series of strokes was left
bedridden until his death in 1924
Lenin's death left the power vacuum
which only two men could fill the first
was Trotsky the second was a certain
Josef Stalin Stalin had played a role in
the Russian Revolution prior to this
first as an editor of the Bolshevik
newspaper and also as a commander in the
Red Army during the invasion of Poland
by the time of Lenin's death Stalin held
the position of general secretary the
highest political post in the USSR
Stalin was able to forge alliances with
other prominent party members and
concealed Lenin's criticisms of him so
Trotsky in Stalin how two distinct
positions with how to proceed trotsky's
position is known as permanent
revolution Trotsky felt that unless
socialist revolution was encouraged in
other countries the Bolsheviks
revolution would halt and it would
become impossible for the soviet union's
to survive whereas Stalin's belief known
as socialism in one country argued that
socialism with in the USSR should be
strengthened before it could be exported
anywhere else so long story short Stalin
was victorious in the struggle for power
and in 1929 Trotsky was exiled from the
Soviet Union he ended up in Mexico where
he was assassinated in 1940 after his
victory Stalin began to tighten his grip
over the Soviet Union he did this by
purges assassination censorship and a
secret police force the NKVD stalin
removed many members of the commie
his party and famously purge the offices
in the Red Army Stalin's most famous
tools in maintaining order with the
ghoul axe the successor to Lenin's work
camps the conditions in these camps were
almost unbearable and the mortality
rates were incredibly high
Stalin wasn't just a tyrant he also
brought about many domestic reforms such
as the five-year plans which were
designed to improve industrial output
which it did to a miraculous degree
another reform introduced was
collectivization whereby farmers were
forced to unite their farms in order to
increase crop yields and speed up
mechanization it should be remembered
that Stalin's reform has changed Russia
from an empire struggling to keep up to
a political and economic powerhouse so
in conclusion the legacy of the Russian
Revolution is hard to measure in many
respects all it did was replace one
authoritarian regime with another it's
worth noting that the actions of Lenin
Trotsky Stalin and many others helped
turn Russia into a superpower one which
was vital to stopping the Nazis one area
where it definitely changed the world
was that it marks the last point in
which Russia and the West saw each other
as allies I hope you enjoyed this
episode and thank you for watching

what's up everybody my name is jesse
cervantes i'm a filmmaker and today i'll
be teaching you how to film a short
documentary
we'll be going over seven basic
fundamental steps that i use
when i film i'm going to keep this to
the point and short so if you do have
any other questions please comment below
this is going to be shot in the
documentary style rule of thirds so you
can kind of get a feeling
of what the documentary is going to look
like
so this can be a bit challenging
sometimes it's hard to find an idea that
you want to film
or what you think others will want to
watch what you will come to find out is
you just have to find somebody who does
something interesting
it doesn't have to be a famous person a
pro athlete
among other successful people everyone
has an interesting life and the best way
to find a visually compelling story
is to think about the b-roll what are
you going to show
visually to help propel the story in the
direction you were looking for
this could be a really fun part go watch
a bunch of short documentaries
you can do a simple search on youtube or
vimeo's website to find
different documentaries on vmail's
website you can break down exactly what
videos you're looking for
by going to watch categories documentary
people and then on the left hand side
there's a filter to select
films under four minutes there are
hundreds of these films that you can
watch and gather ideas
for how you want your short film to look
this could be anything from story
structure
to angles unique perspectives among
other things
remember you are here for inspiration
and not to plagiarize other filmmakers
work
you must think about how you're going to
conduct the interview before you start
filming
figure out what the beginning middle and
end looks like
this could be as simple as you are or as
complicated as you want
here's an easy story structure starting
the film with their name
and what it is they do for example hi my
name is jesse cervantes i'm a filmmaker
and designer living in salt lake city
utah
once you get that talk about what it is
they do why are you filming them
what they want to accomplish how they
got into this field what do their
friends and family think about what they
do
what are their parents like this could
all be things for the middle section of
the film
and you can end with a simple what are
your plans for the future
a more intricate film could start out
with the main emotional point that came
when you interviewed your source this
could grab the audience attention
and keep them hooked to watch for the
entire video
this is where the rule of thirds comes
into play your source is not going to be
staring into the camera
just like me right now there will be
talking with you the camera will be off
to your side
if you only have one camera take some
time to set set
up the shot and pay attention to how
much of the source's face you can see
if the camera is set up close to you you
can see more of the face
and the angle isn't as extreme if the
camera is further away from you
you may only see one side of the
source's face also make sure the
distance from the camera to the source
isn't too close or far away depending on
what focal length your lens is
take some time to set up your shot and
you should be fine
lighting is very important to give your
source depth if you don't have lighting
set up it's best to put your source
close to a window
if there are blinds you can adjust them
and get the right amount of light
intensity on your subject
there are plenty of good lighting
tutorials that i will link below
there are plenty of different angles
movements
and objects to film get creative don't
only film the source from one distance
get close film their hands their feet
face
among other things this helps to keep
the audience in tune with the film
keeping it interesting and exciting
there are a few different angles you can
get when filming
what i do is get multiple angles of the
same shot
that way during the editing process i
have multiple angles to choose from to
help propel the story in the direction i
want to go
[Music]
movements should be kept to a minimum
unless you have a stabilizer or gimbal
to keep the footage smooth
if you do have a gimbal or stabilizer
there are a few different movements you
can do
audio is crucial for getting your
documentary right if the audience can't
hear what the source is saying
or if their mic is rubbing up against
their clothing you're going to have to
refilm
always have a backup use two mics when
you're recording
and this could save you a lot of
headaches music is also a great way to
keep the audience's attention
make sure you are using music that fits
with the style of film you are making
this is a big one talk to the person
before the interview and get to know
them a little
tell them a little about the filming
process most people are not used to
being in front of a camera
and let them know you can edit the film
if they need to repeat themselves
because they lost their train of thought
make sure they know to repeat the
question the audience needs some context
behind what they're saying
for example if you ask them what is your
favorite color
make sure they say my favorite color is
blue versus just saying blue
it gives the audience an understanding
of what is going on
because you will not be in the film only
they will
so editing can be a whole video on its
own and i may do a video in the future
but just make sure you're using your
b-roll to cover up any a-roll cuts
while also using the b-roll to propel
the video
short films can be a long process
they're always worth it though
every situation is different you might
have access to your source for a day or
maybe they're close to your location
and you have access for weeks make sure
you're using the most with your time
and gathering as much film as you can
during the time you have
one film i produced involved the
sculptor she threw clay and then had to
fire the clay
there was no other way to complete this
film than doing it over a few weeks
and filming the whole process along the
way you may run into problem
once you start editing a shot that
doesn't quite look right or a sequence
that doesn't feel
smooth the best solution is to re-shoot
if possible
you

uh
so
[Music]
is
[Music]
thank you
a lot of folks are wondering what what
happened to fortress
why did it close you know what went on
and
i don't have all those answers
kind of sputtered to a stop in 0304
[Music]
we think it was still making money it
was very popular but it needed a big
capital infusion that they just weren't
willing to do at that time
and this place was
allowed to run into the ground
[Music]
[Music]
so we're heading into the old day lodge
which we think was constructed in
1966-67
this was sort of the center of the
action
kitchen is just off to my left
ticketing off uh over on this side guest
services
but just a
beautiful building
saw some vandalism
and there's been some some folks in here
getting copper out of the out of the
walls and
pulling some of the electrical out
[Music]
this room we understand was the
far side lounge
[Music]
which i guess back in the day was a
pretty happening place
a lot of history in this place
my first experience here was in 1984
it was my first time out of the house
and into
almost its own ecosystem
that was pretty much the inflection
point it was either
med school and brain surgery or
graduate and moved to the mountains and
washed dishes
this whole place was made up of people
who
again just lived and breathed a sport
[Music]
in the 80s
everyone wore the same stuff
if you weren't in sun ice like in the
80s you're nothing
everyone wore that stuff so of course
the snow school here did as well and
they had this sort of
teal blue
which of course you can't be living in
the 80s without teal the kind of people
who would come up here were
ready to get lit
it's the 80s so it's a whole different
scene it's like responsibility meant
something entirely different
my name is rob stevens
and
i am still at my core
a fortress mountain dishwasher
i watched
what i thought was my only opportunity
to build a ski resort fade off into the
distance until fortress came along
we're just
putting the capital together to to build
the lifts in the program to start it up
again
my name is chris chevalier
in the industry i'm pretty much known as
chevy
most people don't even know my real name
i think
so we we don't have a mechanic uh as
such up here so
i'm the head hander of tools and i
usually get the wrong one chris is the
guy with along with michael that does
most of the cat work
it's easy to say reopen a skill
i never would have guessed the
complexity of it going into it
to fill the time between starting that
project and actually realizing it
we decided to start cat skiing
fortress is in canada's country about an
hour from the city of calgary the
biggest thing that catches your eye is
fortress mountain itself
[Music]
for sure
[Music]
the canadian chair which is a triple
chair on the front side was probably the
most modern lift and the backside chair
was a double dopplimer which we actually
want to reuse
number runs
probably about 85 depending on on which
marketing guy you want to talk to
[Music]
me
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
so
i'll go get my stopper and start cooking
i think there's going to be some
chicken and
potatoes
what's your favorite dinner
chicken and potatoes
my full name is melvin
oliver
folded
i have a name type that says mountain
now in my vehicle
when we first met mel he was uh living
in the cat shop here he was sleeping in
a lazy boy chair by the fire and kind of
rigged up a tarpaulin over the fire to
try and keep some of the heat in
when they when they locked the gate and
shut down they tried to to kick him off
the land and uh
you know he'll tell you that he moved
into the cat shop
it was very comfortable
we had the stove to cook on
[Music]
there was no electricity there was no
phone line
so not a lot of
connectivity it was pretty rustic
existence
it went on for uh
probably just about a decade
[Music]
some people would say you know why did
you allow them to stay here and
he's a part of the place well if i win
the lottery and i keep buying the
tickets
i would invest all of it
into this operation
because that's how strong i believe in
it
there is genuinely magic at fortress
you you feel it
i don't know what it is it's like i say
i think there's something
genuinely spiritual about this place
if you have that kind of memory of it if
you take that memory with you
you've left part of yourself here
[Music]
i don't think there's any question that
fortress is going to come back because
so many people
want it to happen
and when you have that kind of energy
focused in the same direction
it just is it just will be
[Music]
good day sir one ticket please
you enjoy yourself a fortress mountain
there cheers thank you very much
welcome to fortress mountain
we're excited to be opening soon

ADHD is a very complicated thing and
there is no one true way to experience
it
on paper it's a chemical imbalance in
the brain that causes issues with
executive function memory organization
Focus ADHD is a very hard thing to
describe especially to those without it
because every explanation just sounds
like another excuse I just can't do it
isn't enough even though oftentimes it
is the reason
ADHD is living a life knowing what the
full picture is supposed to be but every
time it matters you find yourself
missing a piece
you're sitting in a classroom the
teacher is up front going into detail
about a new assignment you're confused
and everyone around you seems to be
paying attention and you know that if
you just did the same you wouldn't be
confused but there's something about the
room or the teacher or yourself that's
getting in the way maybe it's just the
way he's phrasing things you think so
you turn to your friend and you say hey
I don't get this are you able to help me
and as your friend they say of course
along with four words you'll be thinking
about for a long time
what don't you understand
you're in your room trying to read the
assignment for yourself but your
thoughts wash it out
if you're reading a sentence and you're
reading a sentence and you're reading a
sentence and you're reading a sentence
and you're reading a sentence and you're
reading a sentence and you're reading a
sentence
you should turn off the fan
and pour yourself a glass of water or
get something to eat
you've really been meaning to stay more
hydrated but you keep losing track of
time I'm thirsty or I'm hungry becomes
I've almost finished this task I'll get
it when I'm done it becomes I've been
sitting here for hours tied to my spot
by the air and my own nerves and I'm
feeling light-headed
to be safe you pour yourself another
glass of water hopefully now you'll be
able to focus
you walk back to your room and realize
the sun has set
you've wasted the day
sticky notes have been known to help you
keep track of what you need to do so you
write a note for yourself and you go to
bed you know it would be better to
prepare for tomorrow tonight but it'll
be fine you've got your alarm set you'll
wake up with plenty of time
you miss your alarms you missed your
chance to pack have breakfast brush your
teeth you're missing your keys and in
the rush to find them you think of all
the times you've been here before if
only you could just learn your lesson
your mum's waiting for you by the door
it's been two days is it really that
important yes it was in the bag but it's
gone missing do you really have to find
it now just leave it we're gonna be
classes started people are staring you
try not to stare back it's rude
nice of you to join us the teacher says
this is the time this month
he continues with the lesson you try
your hardest to focus and pay attention
and take in what he's saying just listen
it's not hard just listen and everything
will be so much easier what is he even
saying oh God this always happens can I
please just listen
you're on the train home you look at the
next stop screen reciting each station
in your head how many times have you
been here how many times have you done
this
you've made it home you're exhausted you
don't know why you didn't even get
anything done today it would make sense
being destroyed if you've gotten
something done but your brain is fried
without the results to justify it
and that's when you realize you forgot
to ask about the assignment whatever
you'll just ask him tomorrow
and why didn't you tell me sooner well I
was meant to but it slipped my mind for
two weeks
it's been two weeks
yes
it's been two weeks
right well um
uh actually what have you been doing in
class the past few weeks what have you
been doing
nothing absolutely nothing but you can't
tell him that that'll never be enough so
you find yourself making something up
that convinces no one but what else can
you do
two weeks two valuable weeks gone wasted
it's due by the end of the week and you
have nothing absolutely nothing to work
with no notes no Foundation you're
running out of time you're running out
of time you're running out of time
you're running out of time you're
running out of time you're running out
of time you're running out of time
you're running out of time
you look at the sticky notes on your
wall they're good at keeping track of
what you've failed to do with what you
haven't even tried to do all the
promises you've made to friends teachers
and yourself that you've broken in time
it's not like you want to let people
down you wish you could do the opposite
sounds like it should be so easy but no
matter what you do you find yourself
somewhere else entirely
it's at this point that they may have
thought of this assignment sends you
into a spiral of Despair are you just
doomed to be like this forever with life
of constant noise and distraction and
disappointment you start to wonder how
long you'll end up stretching this
project out until you can finally get it
done
all hope seems lost you're alone and
exhausted and finally a bottle a small
white bottle
Dex amphetamine the doctor said five
milligrams twice a day it's the only
thing you haven't tried so you try it
and it's like putting on a pair of
glasses after a lifetime of not knowing
just how blind you really were
it helps
good

[Music]
Mr Eaton has become one of the leaders
of the anti racism protests in Britain I
[Music]
don't want us to just be marching on the
roads and screaming black lives matter
we need to be productive in the things
like we're saying because we now have a
voice for weeks regular black lives
matter protests have been taking place
in London and all over the country
mr an Eaton joined the protests a few
weeks ago she hopes that this grassroots
movement will culminate in concrete
political reforms
[Music]
those slogans are important
mr an Eaton once more she is an actor by
profession but the black lives matter
protest in the US moved her and now
she's become one of the leading figures
of Britain's anti racism movement the
biggest thing for me as an organizer is
to ensure that everyone understands and
expresses the same narrative that we are
all unified in the same narrative I
don't actually know my speech I tend to
speak from the heart I have a rough idea
and then I tend to just like most of the
protest this demo in London's Hyde Park
was organized pretty much at the last
minute mr an Eaton only met her cool
speakers recently the Phoenix is Jada
and then after Jada is Ellen I start
within about half an hour's wait for
more numbers and we'll weigh in first no
[ __ ] crowd of people that's always
becoming it's important that the demos
draw big numbers to make sure that the
message gets across and the movement
becomes a catalyst for change
[Music]
that's is why we are here we have and
change means fundamental change in
schools in the workplace and in the
judicial system not everyone here thinks
that such change is necessary
David Curtin whose father is Jamaican
sits as a Briggs at Alliance member on
the London Assembly he's come as an
observer I don't agree with the
narrative that Britain is a systemically
racist country this is one of the best
countries in the world to be a black
person to be an ethnic minority a person
of color there's equal opportunities for
everyone there's equality under the law
is freedom and liberty so I think that
this is a narrative that's being talked
up and is actually creating division
people in the organisation of black
lives matter are pushing for a cultural
change in a cultural shift but you know
this country has a large silent majority
which is conservative and loves our
history and our heritage in our culture
and doesn't want it to change there is a
huge amount of resistance to this
movement that you're seeing it's very
very loud but it doesn't have the
support of the majority of the people
but Mr Eaton and other anti racism
campaigners point out that racism is
subtle and structural in Britain they
say that it starts at school where
pupils are taught about the British
Empire in glorified terms when people of
color crop up the invariably slaves they
say that statues of colonialists and
slave traders have to be contextualized
and history has to be taught in a
different way education is a big one I
mean we're trying to
let the UK learn about its own history
and actually you know have some black
history in the curriculum so systemic
racism is so underlying in the roots
this country is designed to benefit
middle-class straight white male
everyone knows it's fighting ten times
harder to fight that they should fight
and it's unfair that because of my skin
color or anyone else's skin color
sexuality we are looked down upon where
stereotypes a lot as being poor which
they're attacking Najma stereotypes of
being ghetto and we're here to break
that stereotype we can articulate
ourselves the same way all these other
people can comment articulate themselves
we're here to talk what we have to say
and we're going to do it without anyone
else before us Mr Eaton who grew up in
the culturally mixed area of Peckham in
South London says that she has often
experienced racism at times overtly
sometimes covertly get some think that
for myself person that I've gotten used
to whether it is someone going out of
their way to stand nowhere near you ever
it's the odd look when you walk into a
shop yeah there's a lot of micro
behaviors that go on
[Music]
she's also gotten used to hearing
insults all her life
I've been called the n-word before I've
been more covert you're attractive for a
black woman you get a mixture of those
types of things you know and I that one
really burns us as young black women and
that that statement has been said many
years growing up so now she's putting
all her energies into ensuring that she
and nobody else ever has to hear racist
slurs again finding a quiet woman for
herself isn't easy it's very difficult
and especially as I am very new to all
of this I was not someone that was
protesting or organizing protests before
and the photographs of me so for me just
being an average girl from Peckham who
has experienced racism who was
passionate about institutionalized
racism and is confident about vocalizing
it for me it's been very difficult to
now stand by myself in this reformist
agenda and have to try to unite others
that disagree with my gender
what's also new is that she's much more
in the spotlight but thanks to her media
presence if you can get her ideas out
there as opposed to some activist
mr an Eaton is not calling for radical
reforms such as abolishing the police
she wants reforms that the majority of
Britons can get behind and she wants to
educate I'm very much focused on putting
a spotlight on institutionalized racism
that is my main focus she says that only
when this is accepted as a fact will the
racist slurs finally come to an end for
me it's really important that society
acknowledges the fact that we have a
problem with institutionalized racism
and it's only then can we rectify this
problem only then can we find the
long-lasting solutions that we're all so
desperate for
Oh
[Music]
she hopes that the anti-racism movement
will create more respect for people of
color in Britain and amorn thinks this
is the right moment
she says it's imperative not to miss
this chance we can no longer leave with
anger we must be strategic we must be
intelligent we must use our wisdom and
we must fight for the things that's not
actually going to be implemented in law
thank you there's a lot of talk
consistently which is fine right after a
month action Iman is organizing a new
protest with the musician Phoenix they
want to drop a list of political demands
and consider themselves representatives
of the anti racism movement in Britain I
think we both have a very kind of clear
vision for what we think is to happen
for this protest I think we both spoke
and felt frustrated that there wasn't
enough demands being made that our voice
wasn't being heard loudly enough at the
end of the day none of the civil rights
movements we ever had would have gotten
anywhere
leaders and without people kind of
stepping up to the plate and speaking
for the rest of us one concrete demand
that they had is quotas to ensure that
people of color and other minorities in
Brazil can access top positions in
society every five years they have a
quota that they have to meet to ensure
one that we can safely say there's no
longer institutionalized racism within
that industry and two it also gives
confidence to those of the younger
generations who branch into those
industries because they are being
represented and there are leaders that
are black david kurtal is totally
against such quotas which he thinks are
superfluous he is more in favor of law
and order for resolving society's
problems he is also proud of Britain's
history and does not think that the
Statue of Winston Churchill should be
banished to the museum
yeah well he wasn't a perfect man of
course it was a long time ago people had
a different frame of reference for there
he was wrong on some little things but
on the big thing that really mattered he
got that right and he helped this
country defeat Nazism not just for here
but for all of Europe he got that right
and he should be maintained in Pride a
place here mr eaton agrees that there is
no point in simply toppling or defacing
statues as has happened in the recent
weeks she wants to raise awareness in a
more systematic way she seems to have
struck the right tool with her fellow
protesters I think she's powerful I
think she's strong and I think she's
doing an amazing job and has been for
the past month I think she's brave I
think she's a great example that we
couldn't be whatever one would be or we
could embrace our names and we could
embrace our culture and everything else
that we bring to the table she's an
amazing incredible inspirational woman
she has done so much organised this
other protests as well
she's such she's she was anyone she's
such a community spirit in person and
honestly like she deserves an award
really Stickley for what she's doing
today and she's brought everyone
together and the movement seems to have
had an effect politically Prime Minister
Boris Johnson has announced a government
Commission to look into racial
inequalities but him are an Eaton thinks
it's going to be a long haul it's a big
big task a big a big picture that we're
trying to achieve but hope
with this momentum there's no reason why
we can't achieve that she doesn't intend
to stop until these ambitious goals have
been achieved
[Applause]

[Music]
on the vast open spaces of the Kalahari
Desert it's hard to find a place where
such high concentration of animals can
be seen water holes and pans which are
crucial sources of drinking water
attract wild animals such as these
amazing antelope
[Music]
among this small herd of antelope you
can see a huge long-legged bird with a
matching long neck
[Music]
this is a male African ostrich it's
peering into the distance and evaluating
the situation
[Music]
standing more than eight feet tall with
its acute eyesight the ostrich can see a
danger at the distance of many miles its
family is waiting for it nearby
[Music]
the male is trying to drink water
cautiously bending its head to the
ground but constantly looking around at
its surroundings maybe it saw a predator
[Music]
finally the ostrich took the first sip
of water while raising the head to look
around one more time it lets water get
to its digestive tract through the long
esophagus
[Music]
after making sure that the place is safe
and water is tasty the male returns to
its offspring
[Music]
two females are waiting patiently
looking after their chicks
[Music]
after reporting the situation by the
water the head of the family invites
others to follow it
[Music]
chicks born from different females are
members of the same family that is
headed by a male dominant
these babies are only a few weeks old
they've spent a month and a half in eggs
protected by a solid egg shell an
ostrich egg is the largest egg in the
world but compared to the body size of
the adult bird they're small now they're
trying to make steps but soon they will
run at speeds up to 43 miles per hour in
the mean time they stick together being
the shadow of their great parents the
wildlife is full of dangers there are a
lot of predators who want to eat these
young chicks the adult bird has
practically no enemies but baby chicks
are vulnerable
thus their parents are always on the
alert ostriches become brave and very
aggressive during the breeding season
they react to any moving object rushing
to it immediately
first the bird raises both wings high
above its body trying to scare the enemy
and if it doesn't work an ostrich rushes
at the enemy and travels at doubts the
bird can easily reach speeds of up to 55
miles per hour so it's blow is powerful
enough to smash the skull of a lion
[Music]
no one African animal dares to start
fighting with a huge ostrich that weighs
more than 300 pounds but some enemies
like hyenas and jackals can divert and
ostriches attention by attacking it in
groups while the male tries to scare one
predator away the others manage to steal
an end or a chick out of the nest
meanwhile angry females also try to help
the male
[Music]
having kicked the coyote this caring
father returns quickly to its family
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
birds of prey that threatened the chicks
are going to suffer the same fate as
those other predators
[Music]
the rest of the ostriches are waiting
patiently at a safe distance until the
Finley stakes the first once all enemies
have been eliminated they can continue
to enjoy a drink
[Music]
baby ostriches have quenched their
thirst and are now ready to follow their
parents
[Music]
ostriches are polygamous birds a harem
of females gather around the male but
each group always has a dominant female
females lay eggs into a shallow pit that
has been dug by the male that will
incubate the a every night a dominant
male sits on the eggs warming them with
the heat of its body until the Sun
appears this male has only two wives but
lots of worries their wings bodies and
Tails are fully feathered and a head
neck and legs are nearly bare covered
with short down the lowest part of their
leg is covered with scales
[Music]
male African ostriches have a visible
sexual dimorphism with females being
larger with black and white plumage
males are mostly gray or brown and small
moreover different subspecies of the
African ostrich can differ in the color
of the legs and beat some of them have
sandy grey legs while others have
partially bright pink or completely red
legs there was a stretch of time where
ostrich feathers became a fashion craze
hostages were nearly brought to
extinction by hunting ignorant people
used them for their own purposes
making ostrich feather hats and women's
hats as a result such subspecies as the
Arabian ostrich was exterminated by
humans today ostriches are bred all over
the world
ostriches lead a settled way of life
living in small groups of five up to 50
Birds that form flies they often graze
alongside other large herbivores such as
zebras and antelopes why can't a
Sturgess fly the fact is they're flat
breast bones lack the keel that anchors
the strong pectoral muscles required for
flight but these huge birds have adapted
to running fast they can cover up to 16
feet per stride with their long legs the
ideal habitat for them is a tropical
grassland where they have a good grip
reaching high speeds really it's a piece
of cake to bury a head in such a rough
terrain this myth more than likely began
with Pliny the Elder a Roman author who
wrote them
ostriches imagine when they have thrust
their head and neck into a bush that the
whole of their body is concealed over
time this statement turned into a
popular belief that ostriches bury their
heads in the sand when scared
in fact ostriches don't do anything like
that
[Music]
these two males are courting one female
it's the perfect time to perform a poor
chip dance and the female will choose
the best answer
[Music]
ostriches feed mainly on plants but
their diet can also include insects and
even small lizards they swallow small
rocks and pebbles to help rind up food
in their gizzard an adult ostrich can
carry about 2.2 pounds of stones in its
gizzard another little-known feature of
ostriches is the separate excretion of
urine and feces all other birds excrete
urine and feces in the form of uric acid
but the ostrich is unique among birds in
having two separate systems for liquid
and solid wastes it's the only bird in
the world that has a bladder ostriches
don't have a goiter but their neck is so
flexible they can swallow the prey
complete
the ostrich is an unusual bird to find
in Africa deprived at the ability to fly
ostriches are fast runners these birds
look awesome in motion moreover they are
really good parents especially the males
ostriches are also perfectly adapted to
survive in this arid environment you'll
be able to learn even more about other
amazing Birds of South Africa in our new
series of wildlife documentaries coming
soon

when we think of pirates we picture
Brave adventurers swinging on ropes and
brandishing swords but forget those
movie scenes reality is way more
thrilling
and dangerous
real pirates taking on the U.S Navy you
bet an enigmatic attack on an American
warship has many puzzled what are they
hiding
what's the secrets behind the US Navy's
approach to combating piracy and who are
the real pirates of today
Pirates they're not just from old Tales
they're real and still a threat today
back in the Golden Age of piracy between
the 16th and 17th centuries many
Europeans became Pirates to escape
poverty
one scary punishment for pirates was
marooning leaving someone on a deserted
island with a bit of food water and a
loaded gun usually to make a tough
choice
modern pirates are different instead of
Swords they use guns and rocket
launchers
piracy has gone up 75 in the last 10
years
Waters near Somalia are especially risky
these pirates use fast boats fake
distress signals and tricks to get up
close to Big Ships
once on board they want Ransom money
sometimes in the Millions
fighting piracy is hard there are navy
patrols and onboard security but most
Sailors finish their trip safely
with pirates posing a grave threat to
Maritime trade and the safety of
seafarers the US Navy has developed a
multi-faceted approach to combat this
age-old scorch one of the key Strategies
employed by the Navy when it comes close
to such threats is the use of non-lethal
deterrence a widely employed non-lethal
weapon in the maritime industry is the
water cannon which serves as an
effective anti-piracy measure this
device propels a forceful and
impenetrable stream of water effectively
deterring pirates from attempting to
board Merchant vessels
additionally a water cannon has the
capability to rapidly fill pirate boats
impeding their movement and limiting
their maneuverability
enhanced chip hardening is another
crucial tactic employed by the U.S naval
vessels and commercial ships are
equipped with physical measures to make
boarding more challenging for pirates
razor wire anti-climbing barriers
reinforced doors and fortified citadels
create formidable obstacles
significantly increasing the difficulty
of pirates gaining access to ships and
their valuable cargo
the US Navy actively promotes best
management practices otherwise known as
BMP within the shipping industry
these practices include maintaining
high-speed Transit conducting
anti-piracy drills hosting Lookouts and
having Citadel plans in place
by adhering to these industry-approved
protocols ships enhance their
preparedness and response capabilities
reducing their vulnerability to any and
virtually all pirate attacks
another crucial Point worth noting is
that aerial surveillance plays a vital
role in the U.S Navy's anti-piracy
operations helicopters and unmanned
aerial Vehicles otherwise known as uavs
are deployed for extensive aerial
surveillance
these aircraft cover vast areas detect
suspicious activities and provide
real-time information to Naval vessels
and Maritime authorities
aerial surveillance basically increases
situational awareness enabling rapid
responses to piracy incidents and
ensuring effective deployment of Naval
assets
moreover collaborative information
sharing is another Cornerstone of the
U.S Navy's anti-piracy efforts
the Navy actively participates in
information sharing initiatives such as
the maritime security Center Horn of
Africa and the international Maritime
bureau's piracy Reporting Center or the
IMB PRC
by sharing intelligence incident reports
and piracy Trends with International
Partners the Navy contributes to a
comprehensive understanding of piracy
activities and facilitates coordinated
responses essentially preparing everyone
beforehand for what they may expect
the US Navy also places great emphasis
on capacity building and piracy Chrome
regions through training programs joint
exercises and the provision of equipment
and resources the Navy enhances the
capabilities of other Regional navies
and Coast Guards this collaborative
approach ultimately strengthens Regional
forces empowering them to effectively
combat piracy within their own Waters
and contribute to a safer Maritime
environment
furthermore the Navy actively engages in
raising public awareness about piracy
and educating Mariners on best practices
through websites Publications and
Outreach programs they disseminate
information to the maritime Community
empowering Mariners with the knowledge
to mitigate the risk of pirate attacks
and ensure their own safety
these tactics and strategies
collectively form a comprehensive and
adaptable approach employed by the U.S
Navy to combat piracy
in the ongoing battle against piracy
notable organizations like the
international Maritime Bureau or IMB for
short have emerged
the IMB assumes the critical role of
monitoring and documenting piracy
incidents worldwide offering invaluable
insights to governments and authorities
furthermore the United Nations has also
taken proactive measures by instituting
the United Nations convention on the law
of the sea which establishes a
comprehensive legal structure to address
piracy
the unclos mandates International
cooperation among nations in
apprehending and bringing Pirates to
Justice irrespective of their
nationality or the location of their
criminal activities
let's not forget about combined task
force 150. before you start wondering
what this is the CTF 150 is a
multinational Naval task force that
operates under the auspices of the
combined Maritime forces simply put that
its primary mission is to enhance
Maritime security and stability in the
Gulf of Aden the Arabian Sea and the
Indian Ocean
CTF 150 focuses on countering terrorism
preventing illicit activities including
piracy and smuggling and promoting a
safe and secure Maritime environment
the task force operates with
contributions from various Nations that
participate on a rotating basis
these nations provide Naval assets
including warships aircraft and
Personnel to conduct patrols
surveillance and interdiction operations
in the designated area of responsibility
the composition of the ctf-150 typically
includes ships and aircraft from
multiple countries fostering
International collaboration and
cooperation so as you can probably tell
by now the fight against piracy is a
joint effort and the US Navy plays a big
role in it
despite all efforts made by the U.S Navy
some encounters with pirates turned out
rather unideal
on March 18 2006 the Ticonderoga class
guided missile Cruiser USS Cape St
George otherwise known as the cg-71 and
the Arleigh Burke class guided missile
destroyer USS Gonzalez known as the ddg
66 were both on a critical Mission as
part of task force 150. standing as a
Resolute deterrent against the scourge
of piracy
in a gripping encounter that unfolded on
the treacherous Waters off the coast of
Somalia the U.S Navy found itself locked
in a life or death struggle against a
Brazen band of pirates
as the two warships patrolled the vast
expanse of the ocean their senses
heightened and an ominous side emerged
on the horizon a vessel towing a fleet
of menacing Skiffs approached with ill
intent
sensing danger a boarding party from the
USS Gonzalez bravely ventured forth to
investigate
but they witnessed a chilling sight the
pilots were emboldened and armed to the
teeth brandishing rocket-propelled
grenade launchers
in a shocking turn of events the Pirates
Unleashed a hail of gunfire upon the USS
Cape Saint George causing minor damage
the Tranquility of the moment shattered
and Chaos ensued swiftly the Cape Saint
George and the Gonzalez fueled by a
Steely resolve retaliated with a barrage
of small arms fire
The Clash of bullets and the crackling
of flames filled the air as the main
pirate vessel was engulfed in an inferno
and sank beneath the unforgiving waves
in a resounding Victory two smaller
Skiffs were captured and 12 Pirates were
taken prisoner alongside the Grim
discovery of one lifeless body
astonishingly a Somali pirate group
later claimed that 27 of their Coast
Guardsmen had been dispatched into this
ill-fated confrontation
the valley and Pirates who survived this
near catastrophic failure in their
victim selection process found
themselves in captivity their Destiny
uncertain
[Music]
the shocking part is that pirates are
constantly evolving their tactics they
employ various strategies to maximize
their success and evade detection
these emerging tactics include the use
of motherships to extend their reach we
told you this was shocking and that's
not all
they also hijack fishing vessels for
piracy operations taking advantage of
the jurisdictional challenges in
international waters and even hacking
into Shipping Company systems to gather
intelligence or disrupt operations
although Naval operations have been the
primary means of combating piracy in the
Gulf of Aiden and the Arabian Sea there
is a consensus that these efforts alone
are insufficient to fully address the
threat the vast area that Somali pirates
operate in exceeds the capacity of Naval
vessels to effectively Patrol
with approximately 25 Naval vessels
covering over 1.1 million square
nautical miles each vessel is tasked
with patrolling an average of 44 000
Square nautical miles
Pirates often shift their operations to
unpontrolled Waters when Naval forces
are present
recognizing these limitations several
supplementary counterpiracy initiatives
have been proposed including the use of
unmanned aerial vehicles for extended
surveillance Financial tracking and
Analysis to undermine pirate financing
and the prosecution and Punishment of
convicted Pirates as a deterrent
the US Navy also uses unmanned aerial
vehicles that can operate autonomously
following pre-programmed routes and
executing tasks without human
intervention this reduces risk to human
personnel as mentioned
usvs operate in high risk areas allowing
operators to maintain a safe distance
from potential pirate encounters and
mitigating the risk of harm or hostage
situations
equipped with various sensors cameras
and surveillance systems that enable
them to gather real-time information and
imagery
the collected data can be transmitted
back to a control center for analysis
and decision making plus the US Navy
utilizes Advanced sonar systems for
underwater surveillance and detection
these systems can detect submerged
threats such as pirate divers or
underwater vehicles
on top of all of this the US Navy
utilizes power projection as a crucial
tool in combating piracy by maintaining
a visible presence in piracy prone
regions the Navy serves as a deterrent
to potential Pirates
the deployment of Warships aircraft and
other assets showcases the Navy's
Readiness to respond swiftly and
decisively to Pirate threats
discouraging pirate activities through
the perceived risk involved
this proactive approach helps to prevent
attacks before they occur and
contributes to the overall reduction of
piracy incidents
furthermore power projection allows the
U.S Navy to conduct rapid response
operations in case of piracy incidents
Naval assets stationed strategically can
quickly intercept and disrupt pirate
activities providing critical support to
vessels under threat
Maritime interdiction operations
including the boarding and apprehension
of suspicious vessels contribute to the
disruption of piracy networks and the
prosecution of individuals involved
Additionally the Navy's air assets such
as carrier-based and Maritime Patrol
aircraft provide air superiority by
conducting surveillance and
reconnaissance missions
this aerial coverage by the U.S Navy
enhances situational awareness and AIDS
in the early detection of pirate
activities allowing for timely and
effective responses
the connection between piracy and
environmental issues is also significant
particularly concerning Maritime
activities and their impact on
ecosystems
Pirates often resort to unsustainable
and destructive fishing practices that
decimate fish populations
meanwhile pirate vessels also regularly
pollute the ocean through oil spills and
chemical discharges poisoning marine
life and habitats plus when pirates
anchor in sensitive areas like coral
reefs they destroy these fragile
ecosystems that support Maritime
biodiversity and Coastal resilience
however the U.S Navy is actively working
to mitigate piracies environmental
impacts through its Maritime security
operations
in addition to confronting Pirates at
sea Navy patrols aim to interrupt
illegal practices that pollute the ocean
and Destroy fragile Marine habitats
by securing coastlines and major
shipping lanes the Navy helps enable
sustainable fishing shipping and
offshore resource extraction economic
activities that depend on healthy oceans
in protecting Maritime ecosystems from
Pirates the Navy safeguards biodiversity
Coastal resilience and sustainable blue
economies ecosystem services that
benefit not just the United States but
the entire International Community
the Navy's role in Ocean governance
extends Beyond defending ships to
defending the health of the Seas
themselves
taking all of this into account do you
know of any other rules that the US Navy
plays both nationally and
internationally whether it be on land or
at Sea let us know in the comments below
the United States Navy remains steadfast
in its commitment to ensuring the Safety
and Security of the Seas by actively
combating piracy
through its robust efforts and
participation in multinational
operations such as combined task force
150 the Navy plays a vital role in
deterring and countering pirate
activities in vulnerable regions
their dedication is exemplified by
deploying Naval assets such as the USS
Howard and other vessels to Monitor and
Safeguard hijacked ships like the MV
feyna by maintaining a Vigilant presence
and collaborating with International
Partners the US Navy demonstrates its
unwavering determination to protect
Global Maritime trade Safeguard the
well-being of seafarers and uphold the
principles of Maritime security
we extend our utmost respect and
admiration to the courageous individuals
who serve in the United States Navy and
dedicate themselves to combating piracy
their unwavering commitment and bravery
in the face of danger are deserving of
our highest salute these men and women
selflessly put their lives on the line
to safeguard the Seas protect global
trade and ensure the safety of seafarers
their tireless efforts in the ongoing
battle against Pirates are a testament
to their unwavering dedication and the
values they uphold
we express deep gratitude to these Brave
individuals

Thirty minutes north of Auckland
lies an area known as Riverhead forest
 
Here, three females have traveled to a mating
ground known as a "night club"
These females have engaged in an act
found only in the humankind
Clubbing
They've caught the attention of three males, whom,
are ready to mate
The males approach
in the most seductive way they know how
 
and with that the mating ritual begins
it's truly a wonderous sight
 
 
their first objective is to search for an opening
However, this proves difficult as the females keep
a tight proximity
they retreat to a safe distance to re-asses
The situation
 
egged on by the others
the youngest of the three males makes the first move
 
young and hopeful he moves in to strike
 
however, youth and inexperience play against
the youngling
he attempts to connect with them from afar
relying on making eye contact
he gets nothing back
for his efforts
the youngling is frightened and out of his element
he retreats back to the other males
the second youngest preps to make his approach
 
 
he has selected a mate
 
according to the alphamale
if a male can make physical contact
with a female, intercourse is assured
 
he's gone for it
however, in not way has she reciprocated
the gesture causing the male much concern
 
He has to act
 
 
the male retreats, defeated
any hope the males now have lies
with the alphamale
and who could possible turn this stud down?
his confidence is palpable
the females not being aroused my this, is simply
unimaginable
they do however, tighten their circle, a clear test
one the males must overcome
 
 
 
 
 
disaster
Even the alphamale has been denied by the females
 
 
The males desperately attempt to cover up their defeat.
Embarrassed, ashamed, still ridiculously horny,
the males retreat to another club.
Because, you know ...
this one was shit anyways...

emily schindler was always hopeful that
he would reform
that somehow he would come around
she was also a very devoted catholic
because we asked where she didn't
divorce him said no i couldn't i
wouldn't hurt
my parents by divorcing him besides i
love this man
i love this man and while you were not
jealous
no when he will have only one girlfriend
i will be extremely jealous but he has
hundreds
so how could i be jealous about hundred
women
emily's joke the lied hurt feelings
about her marriage
she often argued bitterly with schindler
about his many lovers
schindler's endless pursuit of beautiful
women
never seemed to distract him from the
plight of his workers
they commuted to his factory from the
jewish ghetto
where conditions were abysmal schindler
was well
aware of their misery and learned of the
nazi's plan to liquidate
the ghetto on march 12 1943
oscar schindler told us when we arrived
at work there
that we will not be going back to the
ghetto
that particular evening because the
reason for that is that there is trouble
in the ghetto there is shootings
killings
and a liquidation of the ghetto going on
and we would be better off staying here
until
this is uh over with
the liquidation of tens of thousands of
jews from the krakow ghetto certainly
had a powerful emotional effect on oscar
schindler
who witnessed it he would have seen
beating he would have seen dogs biting
he would have seen officers cruelly
whipping and
screaming and shouting and bludgeoning
every imaginable
form of destruction including mass
shootings
would have taken place at that moment
you know war profiteer can tolerate
an awful lot wartime is difficult time
for
everybody but that may have been the
moment
when it became too much and when he
recognized that something
awful beyond description beyond
recognition beyond articulation was
taking place
and that may be the moment that
changed him those jews who survived that
night were sent off in cattle cars to
death camps
like auschwitz and treblinka it was all
part of what was being called
hitler's final solution
now he knew that there was a
grand strategy to actually
rid europe of these people to treat them
as a virus which would be
totally eradicated
he knew they weren't a virus he knew
that because he knew stern and he knew
those kids he played with
as a child
schindler's jewish workers were sent to
a brutal existence with twelve
thousand others at the slave labor camp
at ploshof
by day they continued their efforts at
schindler's factory
when the work was over they returned to
the desolation of the camp
a place where summary and mass
executions were common
placoff was run by commandant ammangeth
according to survivors of the camp geth
was a monster it was no life
they were waiting for death
he was killing people on random before
they went to work
terrible memories i have when thinking
that
he was coming back through the yard
whistling a happy tune he was content
like a content
animal he loved to see
blood he was training the dogs
how to attack people
it's very hard for me to talk about this
because if
it was terrible he would give out the
order
to the big one to the white rough
and the dog would hop on people
and tear him apart
this was the man with whom schindler ate
and drank
and bonded but the relationship had a
dual purpose
oscar schindler had a plan to get his
jews away
from ammon death

(fast-paced chimes)
- I love bread.
- There is so much good bread in France.
- [Narrator] And although man
does not live by bread alone,
without it, a meal seems incomplete.
- On every corner, there is
a bakery that is pumping out
delicious, fresh, well made bread.
- [Announcer] It's so fresh.
- This is not easily available to me,
and I want to know why.
Why is it that the bread
that I can get easily
looks very, very different?
Why is it that the US
sucks at making bread?
In fact, let me just show
you what that looks like.
(video rewinding)
Okay, wait, it's 12 hours
earlier, still back in the US.
I'm actually at a grocery store right now.
(gentle music)
- This is how a lot of us
Americans get our bread.
(indistinct voices)
Sigh.
My favorite part is when
they make this plastic
look like it's steaming,
it's just like foggy plastic,
to be like, "this was
just baked right now."
And it's like, "no,
this was actually baked
"like three weeks ago in a
factory in like Connecticut."
- [Speaker] It's even made
with real butter. (laughing)
- [Announcer] Always buy Wonder Bread.
(cash register chiming)
You'll be glad you did.
- The reason I'm purchasing this bread
is because I want to bring
it with me to France,
just to like have an example lesson,
and I may use it as a pillow,
'cause it's literally as
soft as a Novaform pillow.
(snoring)
Some of this bagged bread
is made with ingredients
that are literally illegal in the EU.
(machine beeps)
Back to France. Let's do it.
- There is nothing more
American than Wonder Bread.
(upbeat music)
(machines beeping)
- [Narrator] (speaking
foreign language) France.
(light accordion music)
- In case you're wondering, yes.
Any video from Paris must
include music like this.
Nice, gentle, cafe accordion music.
There's my composer,
Tom, making it right now.
- It's pretty cool.
- It's just so good.
Okay, so yeah, we know that
France is good at bread
and the US sucks at it.
Is this just another video
where I shit on the USA
for being terrible at certain things?
Yes, it is.
(music winding down)
That's exactly what it
is, but hear me out.
I actually have something to say here.
I believe that bread is
a really important symbol
for a bigger cultural
phenomenon in the US,
and that's what I want
to talk about today,
where industrialized bread
came from, why it exists,
and how some people are
trying to change it.
(music continues)
I'll get to that explanation, but first,
I'm gonna go into that bakery
over there and buy myself
a large ball of butter and
flour stuffed with chocolate.
Oh, and Tom, can you throw in a beat
to this accordion music, please?
- Yeah!
- Thanks.
(upbeat accordion music)
- [Speaker] Any questions?
- Yes. Are you going to
finish that "quassoint"?
(music continues)
Oh, yeah.
(music fades out)

Okay, so why bread?
There's a million other
things I could talk about
that are better in other
parts of the world,
but it turns out that
bread is the most important
prepared food that humans have ever made.
And therefore, it is worth talking about.
So let me explain, in under a minute,
the overview of the tens of
thousands of years of history
of bread and its chemistry
and why it's so important.
Don't think I can do it in under a minute?
Check this out.
12,000 years ago, humans realized
that they could plant this grass
instead of just foraging for it.
This grass was called wheat,
and when it was ground up with a stone,
it made this powder that,
if you put water with it,
creates this stretchy,
goopy thing that has a bunch
of sugar from the flour
that's been released.
Oh, look.
- Wow.
- [Johnny] All the bacteria in the air
loves this sugary goop.
- Nice.
- And they descend to feast on it,
burping out gas as they eat.
(burping)
Whoa, the gas can't float up into the air,
because it's getting trapped
in this stretchy ball of goop
like a balloon, like a pillow, like magic.
- Magic.
- All this feasting and
burping is making it rise
and turn into a pillowy thing
that is way bigger than it was.
Put this blob next to some fire,
and all of the little bubbles
that were just created turn hard.
Wait, all of this can happen
because of this one grass?
Yes.
"Cool, let's plant a
lot more of this grass
"and build all of human civilization
"off of it," said humans.
♪ Society ♪
So that is bread, like the
oldest and most important
prepared food item that
humans have ever invented.
Eventually, humans got really good
at doing this bread,
flour, water, yeast thing.
And especially here in France,
they took it really seriously
and have created a whole culture
around making bread delicious and amazing.
And you can see that they've
continued that culture today
just by the number of bakeries
that exist in this city.
There are 30,000 independent
bakeries in France.
Compare that to the 3000 that
are in the United States.
And then remember that the US
has like a much larger population.
And if you do all the math,
you see that France has 50
times more bakeries per capita
than the United States. 50 times.
I mean, that is such a clear indication
of how much they value good bread
that is baked a certain way.
Here with Mr. Local over here.
- Yeah!
- Local French food in France.
- Yes.
94% of regions live less than
five minutes away from a bakery.
(tone chiming)
And that shows you they care. They care.
It's like, you hear stuff
like that, and you're like,
"aha, this is their priority."
And the culture of eating is
just as much important here
as how like the ingredients
are sourced and prepared and whatnot.
People don't eat while rushing
towards their next meeting or whatever.
Like it's very much, no, you
sit down, you make it a thing.
It's just a part of the way of life here.
People come into the boulangeries
almost on a daily basis,
and they check in with each other.
It's like a, "hey, how you doing?"
"I'm doing great." This
is what's happening.
- Why, why, why, why?
That is the question.
Why are these bread cultures so different?
And the answer comes down to
what America was founded on.
I mean, a reminder that
America is a country
founded by a bunch of people
who left their country
to go make a new life,
to do things differently,
to do things more individualistically.
And the way that expressed itself
for a really long time was
mechanization industrialization.
And to be clear, in the history,
Britain was as much to
blame for all of this
mechanizing of bread as America was.
- That's insulting!
- But anyway, we're talking
about the USA for a little bit.
So by the 1920s, you had this
machine that was invented,
an automatic bread slicer.
Hello, convenience, innovation, America.
(eagle calling)
(patriotic music)
No more serrated knife
versus a tough crusty loaf.
Now the machine will do it for you.
This is the greatest
thing since sliced br...
(record scratching)
Oh, so that's where we're at.
"This is the greatest
thing," says America,
and Europe was like, "wait,
yeah, we like machines too,
"but like, not for bread.
"Slice this bread, and you
make your bread spoil faster.
"We don't need a machine
for sliced bread."
But the automatic slicer was
just the beginning for America.
- Now, I'm just getting warmed up.
- Now that we have sliced
bread that, yes, spoils faster,
let's make it, I don't
know, not spoil as fast.
One way to do this is to take the part
of the wheat berry that has oils in it,
the husk and the bran, and get rid of it.
(objects clattering)
(cat meowing)
Focus on the big, carb-loaded
berry in the middle.
But there had to be a
more industrial solution
to make the bread last longer,
to be whiter, to be softer.
And it's the 1950s, and Europe is like,
"whoa, dude, America. Chill out.
"Like, bread is just bread.
"We've been doing this
"for literally tens of thousands of years.
"Let's just like stick to the program."
And America's like, "no!"
So America starts adding all
of this stuff to their bread,
bleaches and dough conditioners.
And suddenly they're putting their bread
into controlled chambers
so that it will be
hot enough to rise faster.
And they're putting preservatives in
so that their bread can now sit on a shelf
for not just one or two
days like it should,
but four days, five days, six days,
a whole week, and it's still soft.
It is still white. It is
still spongy and delicious.
But it now has 15
ingredients instead of three.
And it's cheap and convenient and stable,
and America is loving this.
And Europe is like, "whoa."
- Whoa.
"You took this way too far.
"This is not bread anymore."
And indeed, I would argue that
this is not bread anymore.
This is a bread-like substance.
It's a different product made
from a different process,
and yet we use the same word for it.
If you want to know more about
what's inside of this kind of bread,
I was actually here, making this video,
when I stumbled upon a video
from one of my favorite
YouTubers, Adam Ragusea,
that's like a deep dive
into all of the ingredients
in this kind of industrial bread.
Definitely go check it out.
Some bread in the US has taken it so far
that they will put in
additives that keep it
spongy and soft or that
keep it really white,
even though these additives are known
to like cause cancer and inflame asthma...
(coughing)
And...
Do all of these terrible things.
Many of these additives that are legal
to be put in American
bread are literally illegal
in Europe and many other countries.
Azodicarbonamide...
(X-Files theme song)
Is one of 'em.
This is a whitening
agent, but you know what?
This product, ADA, also helps other things
stay softer, like yoga mats.
ADA is in yoga mats to make them...
(toy squeaking)
Spongy and soft.
And it is banned in the EU
and many other countries.
Our obsession with convenience,
cheapness, softness,
shelf life has led us down
a really dangerous path,
and yet we're totally
okay with it somehow.
This is why I think
bread is a useful symbol
for broader American culture.
It shows us how far we are willing to go
to prioritize things like
cheapness and convenience
over tried and true methods
that have been baked into culture.
(drumbeat)
(cymbal clashing)
Of course, industrialized
bread exists here as well.
It doesn't have some of the
carcinogenic ingredients
that are not allowed in the EU,
but it still has all of the
dough conditioners, bleaches,
still artificially risen, all of that.
The difference is that it is rare.
It is much more rare here.
What is much more common is the ability
to go to your local bakery and get bread
that only has a few ingredients,
and it's the ingredients
that humans have been using
for tens of thousands of years
to make this staple food.
- The feeling that I generally have
is that this is how it should be.
And then when I go elsewhere
and you have other kinds of bread
that last kind of bizarre amounts of time,
you're like, "this is not
really how it should be."
You get calibrated to kind
of this new standard here,
and it kinda ruins you. (laughing)
- It turns out Paris is lowkey
one of the most bikeable
cities I've ever been in,
but it used to not be like that.
Like last time I was here,
it was not this bikeable.
I smell some urban design
policy changes afoot here.
Someone tried to change this
in the US a few years ago,
a company called Panera.
- [Announcer] What could be better
than a visit to Panera Bread?
- It tried to bring like
European bread culture
to the United States. And they did.
They had a high quality, delicious bread,
but what happens next is potentially
the best metaphor for America.
- Hello, I like money.
- They got a business
loan so they could expand,
and then they got investors,
and they started to expand and scale.
And then they were purchased
in a massive merger,
and now they're planning to go public
on the public stock exchanges.
Like, they just became
a massive corporation
who does not focus on making
quality artisan bread.
Instead, they're now just
a machine pumping out bread
that kind of looks and
feels like European bread,
but is now done in a uniform,
mass produced, industrialized process,
all in the name of scale and profit.
- (gasps) Wow, they have it. Canned bread.
- So the question is,
why does this matter?
Like, am I just being a snob who's like,
"traditional bread is
better, and therefore,
"everyone should have
it, and I hate America"?
- That was snobby. You're a snob.
- No, I'm not.
- Kind of, yeah, but also, it
actually makes a difference
in how it goes into your body.
The beauty of bread, always,
was that you could put
this goop out in the air,
and bacteria would come down
and start to feast on it
and kind of start the digestion process.
That is what natural fermentation does,
is it starts to break down the wheat
and make it ready to go into your body.
The way that we make bread in America
doesn't really leave time for this.
We use heat and chemicals
to speed this process up,
to make it rise faster,
to make it rise bigger
in an artificial, synthetic way.
And so you're actually getting
a much inferior product
to what original bread making looks like
and what it produces.
Yes, it lasts longer.
Yes, it tastes like chewy,
pillowy, sugary heaven,
but it's not bread the way
that humans have been eating it
for tens of thousands of years.
Convenience, scale, independence.
That is what we love in America.
We love shelf life.
We love industrialized efficiency.
And to me, yeah, all that
stuff is super great,
because it means we get
to live these wonderful,
prosperous, convenient lives,
but I think we lose something really big
when we focus on those as the priorities
as opposed to quality and
community and culture.
Last thing I'll say here is
that this is slowly changing.
You have a movement in
the US of people making
some of the best bread in the world,
using the most traditional
methods and ingredients.
In these big cities, you have
amazing bakeries doing bread
that is on par with anything
you could get in Europe,
and that kind of blows my mind.
The problem is, and my critique,
is that that is still
so rare, and specialty,
and really only available to people
who live in big urban areas.
And meanwhile, the rest of us,
the most accessible bread to us
is this industrial, mass produced garbage.
- Belongs in the trash.
- And that is enough to
make me pretty frustrated.
(upbeat accordion music)

paper was light gold in medieval times
i want tobacco sugar
that everything we thought we knew about
the world
might turn out to be completely wrong
[Music]
scenarios in my head played out over and
over again of me snapping someone's neck
punching them i was really convinced i
was a really bad person i had no
understanding of what was going on in my
mind
every 10 seconds i had an intrusive
thought popping into my head
and it went on for months i thought it
would go away it's just a thing
it didn't go away
i'm alison and i've had puro and ocd for
16 years
a lot of the things that i think about
are violent so i'll think about
shouting things out hitting someone
pushing him downstairs
i'll be sitting in the passenger side of
my mum's driving and i can see
my hand on the steering wheel and i can
see myself steering the car into
oncoming traffic
and it's like it's almost already done
i have a funny kind of experience with
unwanted thoughts because at first when
i didn't know
what intrusive thoughts were i thought
they were terrible i thought they were
absolutely terrible
well i don't really want to push my mom
down the stairs like
a part of me is so sure that that's what
needs to happen and that i'm going to do
it
a lot of people would be shocked with
the way that i sometimes talk to my mum
i'll say to her i really want to push
you downstairs i really want to hit you
i really want to snap your neck and
she's like oh that's interesting oh
that's good
oh that's okay cool nice anyway what's
for dinner what are you cooking
i know she's really tired of it
sometimes she'll play along
these thoughts are what we call
inconsistent with their values
and therefore they are ridiculous and
absurd
to the individual and therefore they do
not get any gratification from them or
pleasure they're extremely distressing
to the individual
and they're spending their life trying
to get rid of them or control them
everyone has intrusive thoughts most
people
when waiting for a train might have
thought what happens if i stepped out in
front of it
someone might be cutting something up
with their kitchen knife and they might
suddenly realize
it would actually be incredibly easy to
just stab
someone with this a person with pure oak
might dwell on that thought more than
average
they might be concerned that says
something about them
you'll have a thought you'll go over it
and over and over and over it
it could be absolutely anything and it
is just thinking
but thinking constantly and at that pace
it makes you exhausted
pure o is a term used by sufferers to
describe
symptoms of obsessive-compulsive
disorder where people experience
intrusive thoughts images urges doubts
inside their mind
which are extremely distressing or
common obsessional thoughts and worries
might be around
sex and violence or religious themes so
for example in a sexual obsessions it
might be the fear that you're a
pedophile when you're
not you're gonna push people in front of
the train
my name is kirk stacy i am a
self-employed illustrator
ocd likes different themes to torture
its host
with with the religious stuff you get a
lot of guilt don't say this don't go
there don't do that
if i thought of a joke and laughed oh
that's rude you can't say that
you have to say sorry to god otherwise
he will punish you
so i was a religious person even though
i wasn't religious
i think the images were just a flicker
of a force
it was a person named white gang there
was another one with the crucifix
there was another one image of the pope
or christ they flash
bang it's there and it's out it's like
life goes in and it comes out
you've got this overwhelming anxiety and
also
guilt you feel guilty for having these
thoughts that you cannot control
i felt that that was the torture i
deserve
for having a fault in the first place so
you're trapped in this cycle
the point being it's not your fault and
there are lots of things that then
shape you during childhood and
adolescence but there is only always
various
triggers or things that are associated
with the onset not always but
quite often my name is nathan i'm 24 and
i'm from hertfordshire
i think what happened when i was about
11 my nan died
i became so worried that i would lose my
mum i had these obsessive thoughts about
her dying
and i remember i would just constantly
ask her if she was okay
she got really irritated because i was
just asking that too much
nobody wants to be asked the same
question again and again and again
the thought of my mum dying terrified me
so i had no understanding of what was
going on in my mind
i eventually began to realize that there
was something a bit weird about the way
i was thinking
obviously at the time that i never knew
ocd was i didn't associate that with ocd
that's only something that i've recently
realised it was there at quite a young
age been there a lot longer than i
thought it was
[Music]
my history goes back 25 years the
trigger for me
secondary school it's my myself and a
few friends who went to local news
agents get some snacks
and i saw one of my friends as he walked
in
grabbed some pick and mix and shoved it
in his pocket and i thought that's how
easy it is while i'll have a crack and i
can show off to my friends
as i came out hey guys look look what
i've got
the store detective was walking in the
shop and she she heard it
did you steal those i was much in the
shop and i think said well
this is really bad the police are going
to go to your house have a word with
your parents
they may have to go to your school you
just weighed on me with all these
threats
and i thought then my mates have
probably used to spread it like wildfire
as a result i became kind of scorphobic
more they tried to push you against that
fear
the more it affects you it's really
really a sad time that one incident
could create such a traumatic effect
the area i live in super quiet nothing
happens but
i just feel like someone's gonna jump
out
everyone is a danger everyone is violent
everyone could kill me i might hurt
somebody else if they attack me that's
kind of my big thing at the moment
is that every second i'm calculating
what's a weapon
that i can use to protect myself with i
last left the house
christmas eve so from christmas eve
until
12th of january but it's not felt
strange it's just felt safe
i really hate the beginning of the year
because i think well it's another year
that i've not
changed or i've not progressed other
people are doing it
so why am i still here struggling
yeah the first time seeing my gp i said
you know i thought i was going blind and
then for some reason i convinced myself
i
was developing schizophrenia which my
uncle has schizophrenia so a kind of
genuine worry if you
if you will like if that didn't pluck
itself out of nowhere like i had
a reason there was kind of some
substance i guess to that
obsession i literally would just stay in
the bed for the whole
with the laptop for two weeks there's no
use
trying my parents would try and get me
up and things
i just kind of have to be left alone
like i there's no i'm not gonna
i'm not gonna be able to function you
just kind of have to leave me but they
were just worried
they were kind of realizing there was
something something wrong
what healthy people without ocd
experience are exactly the same
content as the intrusive thoughts that
occur in ocd the content is the same
but the problem with pure is the meaning
that you're attached to them
perhaps thinking these things means that
i might act upon them or that i'm
immoral for having these thoughts or the
way that you respond to them
control them avoid them or suppress them
all these things
feed the obsession 2003
i had a really bad ear infection it just
felt like someone was
sticking a red-hot needle in there i was
diagnosed with
a clochestioma which is like a tumor
and inside it destroys the inside of the
ear and
left untreated it can invade the brain
and cause meningitis that kind of stuff
and they arranged an operation but we
have to be careful
not to hit the facial nerve otherwise
the side your face would drop
i thought well i'll put the operation on
hold because i didn't like the idea of
going into hospital
and being knocked out
[Music]
and that became a silly little fear and
it grew you're dead you're a dead man
the club chastity human now has spread
to the other ear
it's taken my hearing down i've got
white noise in both ears
when it gets near the point of you know
your operations next week
i knew it would be the death of me
because i would not be able to
surpass it or overcome it coach behavior
therapy includes exposure and ritual
prevention
in other words it's about trying to test
out your fears
developing a different relationship your
thoughts that these are just your own
inner world and you cannot control them
you allow the thoughts to be there but
you can't you don't necessarily have the
exact same reaction
so you end up pulling it apart and
figuring out a way of discerning what
are
authentic concerns versus what's done
by ocd combined with the medication
that's how
i get through the day gets through life
my first encounter with cbt was on the
nhs it was in
a basement of a four-story building
i used to look up the building
regulations of any building that i went
into
i would check out their fire stuff like
when the last time they had a fire check
was like when last time that the gas
person was there
it was in the basement this room was
tiny it had no windows
i couldn't help but feel like there
wasn't enough air in there for the both
of us
he had a shirt that didn't fit that
bothered me his hair was not combed
that bothered me he was like really
red-faced there are far too many things
for me to think about to actually
credit that person that was front of me
i i had no respect for him whatsoever
there's a possibility that i wasn't
really ready to listen to anything that
i felt
was wrong that how i was living wasn't
great for me
and so i feel like i deflected a lot of
my anger
and the way that i was really feeling
about my situation onto that person
erp which stands for exposure response
prevention
it's about exposing yourself to that
which you fear
so say you were completely avoiding
knives you didn't even want to see one
you might go towards starting to use the
knife for its intended purpose
perhaps using the knife around other
people by
exposing themselves to the very
uncomfortable anxiety
you don't stay in that state of high
anxiety forever it will eventually
start to go down
so the last time i had gone to a e by
myself that was when i was convinced i
was both a psychopath and
i think a narcissist and it's just the
process of having to
going up to that desk and then tell the
person what's going on with you
and then you go and see somebody and
there's nothing they can do
their only concern is to work out
whether or not you're either a danger to
yourself or to the public
and if you're not and they then they
send you off on your own as well which
is a really quite horrible experience
i kind of feel like they should have
specific sections in
in in a e departments for mental health
issues which i'm sure they probably do
at some hospitals
but never one that i've been to many
people it can be cured for some people
it can only be
managed and for some people it's a
struggle when i had
purero mine was incredibly severe i
couldn't do
anything else and it was incredibly
scary it still
does occasionally pop up but it doesn't
make me afraid in fact it really has
no effect whatsoever so it will pop up
and then maybe i won't have it anymore
for the next couple of days
there's always been this big debate
whether you cure
or you manage it depends
what you consider to be cured
i'm a complete knight yeah i don't know
if i'm hopeful i just get on with life
i have all these things i want to get
done with my life
i think hope is a waste kind of wasted
energy
you know i just take things as they can
it's not going to go anywhere i don't
think i think it's too
embedded in my personality not my
personality but my
brain whatever i don't think it's going
to go away
when i look back at the old me i feel
sorry for that person who was in the
bubble
you have to convince part of your brain
that you can beat this thing it's about
exposure i have to expose myself to the
spikes in anxiety expose myself to the
intrusive thoughts and live
anyway live through them not around them
which i'm really good
at doing you can create a structure
where
you can survive it i'm happy that i'm
actually creating an artwork and selling
it and i'm taking commissions
i'm happy now if you want to change
something you have to actually
actively make changes to be too afraid
to make the changes
it's just accepting that where you are
now is perfectly fine for you which is
not
so i have to do stuff like walk around
the block understanding that someone
isn't going to jump out from the bushes
and try and attack me
if you do something enough and you sort
of like retrain your brain
then you should really like rewrite like
your neural pathways
basically i should be able to rewrite
the story in my head

hello everyone and welcome to retail
archaeology today we're gonna be taking
another look at Metro Center Mall to see
how it's doing since some time has
passed and also since the Wal Mart is
opened and as you can see here the Wal
Mart is open and it's pretty busy but
it's actually not attached to Metro
Center Mall they leveled the old
Broadway anchor for this and then built
this Walmart there but there's actually
a gap between the two so it makes the
mall look kind of weird now we're gonna
continue our tour by taking a little bit
more of a closer look at some of the
outside of the mall like this Sears
building for instance because I find
this mall just to be really
architectural interesting I love that
building now here's the Dillard's and
this is also another interesting looking
building and I love those lights in the
front this still is actually only
occupies the top floor of their building
now though it's a Dillard's clearance
center kind of similar to the one at
Fiesta mall and here is the long closed
Macy's you can see the label scar there
and we'll get a closer look at it here
in a minute this is one of my favorite
buildings is this old Macy's buildings
it was originally 8 Goldwater's and I
love the front entrance there it's so
grand and so 1970s it's fantastic and I
love the gold tiles
look at how high up that goes it's just
absolutely amazing I love that this
anchor has been vacant since 2015 and
it's really starting to show the fact
that it's been vacant as we'll see here
in a little bit I love these tiles if
they ever knocked this building down I
want to rummage through the rubble pile
for a few of these because I just I love
them and I really like the stonework or
I guess you can call that pebble work on
the columns here as well you just don't
see that kind of stuff anymore Metro
Center Mall opened in 1973 and a lot of
the outside of it is very stylistically
the same as it was when it opened for
example this old Goldwater's which
eventually became a Macy's it was a
couple of different anchors in between
totally empty in there though and here's
a another entrance on the other side and
this one's really gross actually all the
spiderwebs
[Music]
[Music]
I always found empty department stores
to just look really eerie
now this is another empty anchor the
last thing this was was a JC Penney's
but it had been a few other things as
well in the past and there's an elevator
or was an elevator inside this big glass
column kind of thing here he goes way up
there
you see there a few of the windows have
been broken too and they've just
replaced them with wood
[Music]
this anchor has been vacant for a while
as well and it's it's starting to show
inside you'll see here there's pieces of
the ceiling falling down and you can see
the door for the elevator there as well
and here we're looking in that a glass
column area and you can see the back
door of the elevator there
now let's take a look at the inside of
the mall and as you can see when we get
in here it is even worse than the last
time we visited we visited here on a
Saturday afternoon this is about one
o'clock in the afternoon and there's
just not a lot of people here and
there's many more vacant stores I do
love that tile floor though that is one
of my favorite things about this mall
you can see here they've just got a
whole set of escalators blocked off and
not working and this is just not a
healthy look for a mall on a Saturday
afternoon we're walking towards the
Sears right now and one of the other
things I love about the smallest the
skylights the circular and rectangular
skylights makes it very bright in here
to give you a little update on some of
the recent history of the small the last
time it changed hands was in 2012 when
it was sold to the Carlyle Group for a
little over twelve million dollars and
they had stated at the time that they
hoped in the next five to six years to
redevelop it into a mixed-use
residential medical business and retail
area but like I said they bought it in
2012 and they said five to six years so
we're starting to get towards the end of
that time frame and it doesn't look like
any sort of redevelopment besides the
new Walmart has really happened or is
planned anytime soon and like I
mentioned it's getting much worse it's
starting to get to the level of how
Fiesta mall looked when I first started
documenting it it's it's really dying in
here which is really unfortunate another
really interesting factoid about this
mall is that like I mentioned in my
other videos this was used in the
movie Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
is a filming location this was San Dimas
mall in the film it looks a little bit
different now because it was remodeled
in 2007 although a lot of the stuff that
was done here still looks 90s to me for
example the the tile floor and
everything
now this Strutt lab thing really caught
my eye because strut was actually
something I participated in in high
school in the late 90s and if I remember
correctly that stands for students
refurbishing used technology and
basically what we did is we took old
donated computers and refurbished them
to donate them to nonprofits and schools
like that and we got school credit for
that I got my A+ certification doing
that which is not current like I said it
was in the late 90s when I did that so
another sign of a dead mall there's like
a I wouldn't call that a charter school
I guess but there's like a little
educational thing going on in there
there's the Phoenix sofa factory over
there
and I love that elevator
seriously though like 1 to 2 p.m. on a
Saturday afternoon and this is what it
looks like
GNC all the way across the way there
another dead mall staple
and another really cool skylight
see what I mean though that looks very
similar to how fiesta mob was looking
towards the end
[Music]
another reason why I wanted to do this
video a kind of a selfish reason is I
recently acquired a new camera so this
is being filmed with a brand new GoPro
Hero 6 black that I recently got and I
chose that camera because it's little
and it has a lot of different filming
options and features like I can film in
1080p I can film in 4k I can film an
ultra slow motion but also it's really
tiny and it films pretty smoothly I
think so you got the window down in the
comments what you think of this camera
and also what you think of sassy there
and white sassy didn't make it this
store was cracking me up to you because
it was a vape shop which is already kind
of lame but then they had fidget
spinners in the glass case as well I
guess the the fidget spinner slash vape
business model wasn't sustainable now
this is interesting what we're looking
at here is the interior entrance to that
old goldwater slash Macy's anchor that's
now empty and you can tell this is old
school department store with the big
glass cases there and you can see the
tile also matches although they've
painted it white which sucks that tile
was gold at one point inside the mall as
well I've seen old footage of the small
in the 1980s with that tile being gold I
don't know why you would paint white
over it like that it just looks awful I
don't know if you'd even ever be able to
get that white paint off of there
although I don't know if anybody cares
either
and here we can see where the entrance
to the Walmart would be if it was
attached to the mall and this is another
wing that is very dead there's nothing
down here except for the anime store
which a lot of people have commented on
the previous video about well this time
I actually got a little bit of footage
of the inside of the anime shop in case
you're interested and as you can see
there's actually some people shopping in
here I was actually kind of surprised to
find people in here with it being the
only thing open all the way down on this
wing of the mall I want to take a minute
so you think body and tag for once again
providing the music for this episode
I'll flash a link to his band camp page
down there so you can check out this
particular album which is OS 10 paradise
and one that I enjoy quite a bit that
storefront there that marbled one it's
been empty for a while and that's
actually one of my most favourite empty
storefronts in this mall it's like the
definition of aesthetic right there and
we've got ade now and then one in two
trinket shops down there take a quick
look at the food court and you can see
this is also not busy I think this is
about 1:30 in the afternoon at that
point when we filmed the food court and
you can see there's a lot of vacancies
in the food court a lot more than the
last time I was here and not a lot of
people eating
very quiet for a Saturday afternoon I do
an invention that we are going to be
documenting the area around Metro Center
Mall as well as it changes and evolves
into what its gonna become eventually
who knows what who knows what that's
going to be but there's a lot of other
interesting things surrounding Metro
Center Mall to look at so definitely
expect more videos on that coming soon
and look here's a cool arcade and I'm
going to turn the music down a little
bit because there's actually some
old-school games in here and I want you
to be able to hear what an old-school
arcade sent inside a dead ball
love that Street better to cabinet I
used to play it's Hana Street Fighter 2
in the mall when I was a kid and it was
really cool to hear that cabinet again
it warms my heart to see these games
going in an arcade in the mall even if
it is a dead mall and who knows how long
this arcade will actually be here now
what we're gonna take a look at here is
probably the busiest area of the mall
this is right in front of the like guest
services and security desk and this is
where life is still clinging into a
little bit but if you remember Fiesta
mall that was kind of the last holdout
area to was right near the guest
services and security desk there was
some store still open the play area you
know things like that so again very
similar to Fiesta mall gonna leave you
with this shot of this little empty
store just cuz I thought it was cute

395 and the roman empire has been split
in two
this was done by emperor theodosius the
first known also as theodosius the great
because he defeated the goths and made
the official religion of the empire
christianity
he did this in a very clever way by
banning all of the others
the empire's two halves were to be
inherited by theodosius sons
arcadius received the eastern half
centered at constantinople and anorius
received the west centered at medeolanum
in case you're wondering rome was seen
as the spiritual capital of the entire
empire and it's important to note that
the empire wasn't officially divided
those who controlled the two halves saw
themselves as joint rulers of a single
empire but realistically they were run
as separate entities at this point
as a whole the empire had a population
of about 40 million people and was
fairly urbanized
rome was the largest city and had a
population between 350 000 and half a
million but the east as a whole was much
more urbanized the major urban centers
there
included the likes of constantinople
antioch alexandria and corinth
feeding the masses of roman
constantinople required what was called
the grain doll
this was where wheat was imported from
the fertile regions of north africa and
egypt to the cities at great cost to the
imperial treasury
this was part of the bread and circus's
mantra whereby feeding and entertaining
people meant that they would shut up and
not riot the entertainment was mostly
paid for by the wealthy but after 404
this entertainment would no longer
include gladiatorial combat
this was because the monk telemachus
tried to stop a fight between gladiators
and was promptly murdered
anorius moved by this banned
gladiatorial combat because it was
unchristian and apparently not okay to
watch people maim each other for our
entertainment
so another major expense to the treasury
was of course the army which numbered
between 400 and 500
000 men this was extremely expensive and
required an extensive tax system and
bureaucracy to make sure the army was
paid on time since if the army wasn't
paid on time they tended to revolt
both halves of the empire suffered with
many problems corruption rebellion
financial crises and perhaps most
notably barbarian invasions
side note the term barbarian will be
used to describe non-latin or
greek-speaking peoples who originated
from outside of the empire
there were loads of barbarian groups
that the romans had to deal with but the
main ones were the celts the franks the
vandals the ostrogoths the visigoths and
later on the huns
the eastern empire was wealthier than
the west but had to share a border with
the extremely potent sassanian empire
meaning that it can never bring its full
force to bear unless they face a
deadlier invasion
nominally the western empire was run by
an aurius but the real power lay in a
man called flavius stiliko who was born
to a vandal father and a roman mother
i.e he was a barbarian or at least was
seen to be by his peers
this was not a rare occurrence since
there were many groups of barbarians
that had been allowed to settle within
the empire and the condition that they
fight for it
the romans rarely held up their end of
the bargain though and this led to many
barbarian groups revolting the most
notable example of this
occurred in 378 when the agreement
between fritigen and his goths and the
roman emperor valens wasn't honored
fritigen revolted and defeated the
romans at the battle of adrian oppel in
which valens was killed
surely after this though the romans
would learn to uphold their bargains but
fun fact
no so a visigoth called alaric had been
rampaging across the balkans and in
order to get him to stop he was given an
imperial title and allowed to settle in
a lyrica here he wanted to be closer to
rome rome wanted him to not be closer to
romans so he decided to compromise in
401 when he raised an army and marched
on rome
he was stopped and defeated by stillico
but this invasion did lead to an aureus
moving the capital of the western empire
from mediolanum to ravenna which was
more secure
in 406 another invasion this time led by
a gulf called radagases entered italy he
was also defeated by stiliko but in
order to do so he had to withdraw troops
from the northern border which in
hindsight not a great idea because
immediately after this in came the
vandals who flooded into ghoul
fortunately for stillico things would
quiet down after this by which i mean
they would get considerably worse
in 407 a general in britain declared
himself to be the rightful emperor as
constantine iii
in invaded ghoul stiliko was being
blamed for all of the previous few years
failings and him being half vandalman
that many questioned where his loyalties
lie
as such he was accused of being a
traitor executed and soon afterwards the
romans slaughtered any of his allies and
whatever vandals they could get their
hands on with stylico now a bit on the
dead side things started to get a bit
better for the western empire that was a
lie i'm sorry
alaric made his way back into italy
again and was free to do whatever he
wanted
honoris was getting a bit worried by
this point and so recognized constantine
as his co-ruler to help the situation
it didn't in 410 after his third siege
of the city alaric took rome and
promptly sacked it he was a christian
and so he spared most of the churches
but the city was damaged quite severely
the main damage was to roman prestige
however since rome had remained safe for
800 years
rome was no longer invincible and by
extension neither was her empire in
either the east or the west
after the sack alaric went south where
he promptly died removing at least one
major threat from
the romans it was in this same year that
the people of britannia had complained
of their lack of protection from celtic
raids to anorees he promptly told them
to deal with it
as such britannia's place in the empire
simply fell away and it would never
again be under roman rule
in 411 after failing to secure ghoul or
defeat the barbarians constantine
decided this emperor business wasn't for
him and he abdicated soon after which he
died
of being murdered so the west was
starting to fall apart at this point but
how was the east doing
fine really there was no immediate
prospect of war with the persians and
the wealthiest regions of the empire
were far away from danger in the south
4away did see the death of arcadius and
the succession of his son theodosius ii
though
back in the west the roman army spent
the next decade mopping up the remaining
bands of barbarians as well as any
remaining rebels or usurpers
much of this was done by allowing the
barbarians some semblance of
independence such as when the visigoths
were granted territory here in 418.
by 423 the crisis had subsided and so an
aurier celebrated
by dying and after some arguing he was
succeeded by valentinian iii
theodosius's nephew 4 22 he'd seen the
outbreak of war between the eastern
empire and the sasanians but they agreed
to peace after only a year
with all this in mind it's important to
remember that the vast majority of
romans thought the empire was fine
rome had suffered many civil wars in the
past and had also survived the 3rd
century crisis so there was little
reason to think that this time would be
any different
in the east this certainly seemed to be
the case since it saw the beginnings of
an economic boom which would last until
the 6th century
the issues of the barbarians within the
western empire were growing worse though
with many groups notably the visigoths
and the vandals demanding more territory
valentinian iii was essentially a puppet
to a general named flavius atheists who
failed to deal with the barbarians in
any meaningful way
in fact he had to turn to a new group of
barbarians to help suppress rome's
enemies
the huns led by a certain attila the
huns were a nomadic group of people who
had been pushing west for several
decades at this point forcing other
barbarians to also head west into the
roman empire
80 has made regular use of hunnic
mercenaries to help fight other
barbarian groups which even when it was
successful was only so for a short time
roman success was short-lived since it
was never long until barbarian groups
would rise up again in revolt and start
taking territory by the late 430s the
romans had settled large groups of
barbarians
in ghoul and hispania who were also
essentially independent reducing the
western empire's effective territory to
this
of course the major change occurred when
the vandals led by king gen zurich
settled in north africa in the early
430s and in 439 conquered the city of
carthage this was a major blow to the
western empire since the vandals now
controlled the grain supply to rome and
thus could cut it off whenever it suited
them
furthermore the loss of all of this
territory meant that rome could no
longer raise as much taxes it had done
previously and so it couldn't pay its
troops
soon after the fall of carthage jt has
raised a large force to retake the city
from the vandals but this wasn't to be
since the eastern empire was then
invaded by a massive force of huns so
these troops had to be recalled
in case you're wondering both the east
and west had attempted to help each
other several times before this such as
when the east sent troops to carthage
but generally speaking self-interest won
out over fraternity
so the hanukkah threat had picked up
massively during the 40s as attila had
united the huns and subjugated people
like the ostrogoths
attila's empire looked like this and in
the early 450s he launched a large-scale
invasion of the western empire this
culminated in the 451 battle of the
catalonian fields which saw atheists
command an army mostly made up of
barbarians against the huns
a colossal amount of people died and by
453 the hunted withdrawn from the
western empire
and it was in this same year that attila
died his empire subsequently fell into
civil war and disintegrated fairly
quickly
454 saw the assassination of atheists by
valentinian who the next year was
himself assassinated in the wake of
valentinian's death the west fell into
chaos which saw more territory lost and
roamed sacked again in 455 this time by
gen zurich by 457 the emperor was a man
called mayuri and who actively sought to
reconquer the lost territories within
the west
he had some success with this and
recaptured all of this territory with
the help of his magister militant
rissima
rissima would have miurian assassinated
and would then rule the western empire
as stiliko had through a series of
imperial puppets until his death in 472
there were some more weak emperors in
the west until a man called orestes took
control of it and named his son emperor
as romulus augustus although he's better
known as augustulus which means little
augustus
both of these were soon chased off in
476 by a man called odawasa who forced
romulus to abdicate leaving the imperial
throne vacant in the west
this is with the exception of the former
emperor julius nepot who claimed it but
had no authority
this is by many historians considered to
be the final end of the western roman
empire
in the void it left were many new
kingdoms including the vandals the
visigoths the franks are now in italy
the kingdom of odawasa which pledged its
allegiance to the eastern emperor zeno
zeno would of course have other plans
and task the ostrogothic king theodoric
to retake italy as the eastern empire's
representative which he would do by 493
so the roman empire in the west was now
gone rome lay in ruins and the city
wouldn't really recover until the 19th
century
whilst rome had fallen the roman empire
had not and in the east it stood as
strong as ever
what remained was a highly urbanized
empire which would dominate the eastern
mediterranean and would continue to do
so for another two centuries
with hindsight it's easy to look at what
happened in the west and assume that it
was inevitable
rome had survived many great problems
before but this time it was many
weaknesses combined which led to its
ultimate collapse in the west
whilst the roman empire had disappeared
from western europe her legacy would
endure and would be something
and monarchies alike would aspire to be
over the next millennia or too
i hope you enjoyed this episode and
thank you for watching and a special
thanks to james bisonette for sponsoring
the channel
if you'd like to know more about the
fall of rome there are some book
recommendations in the description below

a lot of times I would show up at
tournament bring something really silly
and unorthodox and go up again you know
the best players in the world with the
most serious decks at the best decks and
I find a way to win because I'm
anticipating that because obviously you
guys are sure to win if you know what
they're gonna do you can kind of prepare
a secret trick to Surprise them and
catch them off guard he's picking it up
he's feeling it out oh look at it
toast with this banana grid oh wow
every time I do that did you always get
a huge kick out of this yeah toast is
showing us that can be different and
good you can have fun and win because of
this reputation as the game breaker
whenever like a small of you're without
access to you know YouTube or whatever
it was just message means that hey toast
I think I discovered something crazy can
you test it out the other half of the
times cuz I just have so much experience
by now testing these hearthstone bugs
and because of my patents or your
programmer you can kind of see the lines
where something's gonna break
like if something reacted a really
strange manner you can kind of connected
dodges like alright if I applied this
card see this other card based on this
rejection something's gonna mess up here
because of the way it's coded so I got
banned from playing hearthstone by
Blizzard for three days because I used
an exploit to get some free wins in a
competitive game like hearthstone so
what would happen is my opponent will
start to game out such game now with
these load trick where I disconnect him
from the game and by the time he
connects I've already won
oh my god it's a monster half mirage
color have reluctant what have I created
Wow it was uh it was a really dirty
exploit I didn't think it was gonna look
like that when someone told me about it
it was like the bug is like oh then test
this bug out and when it work I'm like
oh pretty sure this isn't supposed to be
allowed so I did it a few more times on
screen and obviously that's not in Fair
spirit and Blizzard kind of message me
he's like hey I know your things to test
out these bugs to test out these
exploits but you can't have you cheating
games publicly in front of 10,000
viewers so they handed me suspension
from the game so for quest mage people
knew the combo the interaction of you
know infinite fireballs the opponent's
face but it's hard to play when you
about playing aggro decks there was this
play called ray who made a very
defensive style classmate deck that
played an Ungaro and going to knights up
the Frozen Throne it's like it wasn't
one of my favorite decks and just kept
playing and playing and finding until
I'm just really really good at it
because that deck you can really mess up
the second you mess up one combo on one
spell you over draw one card
you're gonna instantly lose the game so
it's a deck that's really fun but
extremely punishing if you mess up on
anything but once you achieve that
combos like well I'm gonna I'm gonna
show you temple rogue right now is that
insane position all right oh my god yes
yes then we're like you know what
let's play it again Prince Kalos a
particular seems to be making the his
plane to every deck pyro warrior I've
seen run telesat I've seen zoo warlock
I've seen aggressive thousands in temple
robe Telus app seems to be making a
splash in everything you know you've run
calluses and run patches and run the
captain that comes out as a charging
three three for free so I go that seems
to be having some popularity but it's
not like the patch I go decks like a
high warrior where I'm gonna hit you in
the face until you're dead or token
druid was like I'm gonna have an insane
4x2 it's like Oh 1.2.3.4 drop by drop
their most overpowered ultimate
infestation
I don't it's hard to say it's a really
powerful card but ten drops is supposed
to be how big one people have been
talking about it ice block it's not fun
to play against ice boss
I mean I played quest mage so I'm using
like two ice blocks and I'm trying to
get as much ice box that I can from
extra you know sources but man it's
tilting he's at one health and you're
doing everything you can you can play
the biggest minion you can draw so much
cards as you want
it's like he's gonna survive a turn and
sometimes that one turn just once in the
game prince calluses has been talked
about a lot too as a card that just has
the potential to snowball game out of
control when you look at the car like
tusks are totemic which was nerved
because if you row a certain totem you
can have a 15% chance increased to win
the game and Prince Telesat is like that
when you look at the stats you know if
you drop it on to your odds of winning
just goes up at 10%
we just increase our odds by 10 percent
of winning this game and if you don't
have gone to they're still playing a
really strong day so you'll probably
have to keep an eye on tell us at do you
have to fill your entire to drop lien
around it luckily for Rose they have one
of the best turn to people power and
they run Firefly becoming ice block is
probably like my number one list of
cards to look at they obviously had to
play give them something more defensive
because almost every single image that
relies on ice block in one way or the
other the pattern right now there seems
to be a nerve every two months I think
this time it was like with them one
month because it was just so out of hand
and I gotta commend Blizzard for that
one they usually like to waste like
quest rogue seems strong but let's wait
you know two months or three months but
this is the one time they're like one
month is like okay this is out of hand
we got change it the nerve to innervate
the big one
cuz innovative was a card that you can
plan around you know when you play it
gets a priest you know what they're
gonna do pulls your madness get over
dance chat about pain dragon fire potion
but with an invading a droids arsenal is
like alright its turn to you can wrath a
wild girls but your opponent's like oh
just kidding I'm gonna innovate innovate
hiya black pine here's a big minion that
you have to kill and you have no mana to
do so
so without innovate to worry about every
time I play games to do it I know why I
can SPECT and it feels fair I can plan
my plays out having fun is more
important than winning obviously if you
can have fun and when it's great but
it's not always about playing the best
things not always using the best fat
if you want do something crazy and just
pull it off and add this huge moment of
satisfaction it's okay to lose nine
games to have the perfect combination of
cars to create this really cool thing

for decades now
israelis and palestinians have been
locked in an ongoing dispute over a few
thousand square kilometers of land
the west bank sandwiched in between
israel and jordan
ever more jewish settlers are moving
here some of them from germany like
khayatal she lives in a launch foot
[Music]
personally i see no problem with our
living here it's a matter of how we live
[Music]
is a settler and to many palestinians a
provocation
for her part she claims direct contact
is the only real path
to peace
was born in saint petersburg in 1991
and grew up in cologne at age 19 she
emigrated to israel
she's been living in a jewish settlement
in the west bank since 2014.
the chain symbolizes the country of
israel i'm not a political person
i'm a religious person for one thing for
another i've got my principles
and one is that the land should be
unified for everyone who lives on it
lives in this converted container in the
alonso settlement
just over 20 kilometers south of
jerusalem
the united nations and the european
union both regard the jewish settlements
as violations of international law
as they're built on occupied territory
but the settlers justify their
initiative by citing an israeli court
ruling that declares the building
of the settlements legal our conflict
isn't over by a long shot
it may even get worse anything can
happen we might all contract the
coronavirus and wind
up in solitary confinement so nobody
will be able to attack the other
that'd be just dandy this corona corner
we first met haya in early march as the
purim festival was just getting underway
traditionally jews don costumes for it
and exchange
gifts at that time the coronavirus had
already come to israel
but the people were still getting
together to celebrate
they kept up their usual social contacts
and did not yet
practice distancing why did the settlers
prefer the relative isolation of the
judean mountains
on some of the most disputed land in the
world you mentioned
the people who live here do so partly
for their beliefs partly financial
reasons
just because it's cheaper or they like
the sense of community
i'd never lived in a community before
where all the neighbors are so tightly
knit
[Music]
really nice because it reminds us we're
not alone and that everything's not as
simple and beautiful as it would appear
at
the first bank is about the size of the
u.s state of delaware
but the potential for conflict is vast
about
430 000 jewish settlers live here
among 2.7 million palestinians
behind fences walls and barbed wire
the expansion of jewish settlements
extensively impacts the lives of
palestinians
like ali abu awad he comes from a family
of political activists
his brother was shot and killed at an
israeli checkpoint in 2001.
abu awad was active in the resistance
against israel
and spent years in prison he says he's
renounced violence
even if the discrimination continues
unabated
his palestinian license plate is enough
to get him stopped at the supermarket
by security
asked
the officer asks to see some id but
doesn't have any on him the officer
suggests he look for it in his car
and that he cannot let him into the
parking lot without an id
even if he did the next officer would
stop him so abu awad
offers to turn back
i forgot my id so i was not allowed to
enter
this doesn't happen to the israelis just
the palestinian that has to be checked
and if you forget your id it's a big
deal
[Music]
i feel sometimes that every palestinian
is a suspicion until you prove you're a
good guy
uh everyone here is like uh
freaking out in a way because there is a
lot of fear a lot of
different activities attacks any any
wrong
move in this junction in gushitsun
junction
any mistake with a wrong move
while you are driving it can cost you
your life
[Applause]
when i look around i see many
settlements are
surrounded surrounding this land
i mean this is what i see
and this is what palestinians face every
day for these people to exist and
practice
their identity there is a price of my
dignity and my rights
that i have to pay every day and this is
injustice
israelis are acting without considering
the palestinians
as fact on this land palestinians are
struggling to survive that
but also to start to harm the occupation
in any way
and this is endless i don't want to
spend my life doing this
i'm out of this victimhood and the
feeling of victim
in both sides is such a huge issue it's
even the competition of suffering
who suffers more none of us is going to
give up his right
none of us
for decades israelis and palestinians
have been locked in a kind of local cold
war
in which neither side wins
hayer shares this view and sees it as
unfair that she and other jewish
settlers
are called an obstacle to peace in the
middle east
450 000 israelis are not something to be
ignored
and you can't just classify several
hundred thousand people as criminals
and think you'll be able to expel them
for some political motives
personally i see no problem with the
fact that we're living here
it's more of a question of how we live
here of how we behave and how the other
section of the population
the arab inhabitants of judea and
samaria the palestinians
behave towards us of the kind of
interaction happening here
and it's not happening very positively
i'll have to admit
on the question of whom the land belongs
to there are no easy answers
people debate the issue and seek
dialogue with the other side
like khayatal rabbi hanan schlesinger
lives in the alonsford settlement
together with palestinian partners he's
launched the grassroots initiative
called
roots six years and six weeks ago
for the first time my life i had a
face-to-face meeting with the real
palestinian before that i had seen them
on the street
i had hired them to work in my house
they did my gardening but i never really
talked to them
i was completely thrown for a loop that
here are people
that i thought of as terrorists and they
have a human story just like mine
i was so taken aback to hear their
stories of living under occupation
i'd never used that word before i'd
never heard that word before in a
face-to-face conversation
here we are
both sides are an obstacle to the other
side's peace
our identities are the obstacle to peace
we have two contradictory identities
israeli say and it's true historically
that the whole land is ours that's true
we were here 2000 years ago
but the palestinians are also connected
to the whole land from the jordan
mediterranean in the same whole land
it belongs to both sides legitimately
rootz organizes regular events for
israelis
where palestinians talk about their
lives under israeli occupation
for some of the young men and women here
this presentation will be their very
first
direct contact with an arab
once an enemy becomes a partner there's
a chance of finding a political solution
that's the idea behind roots we have to
create a new reality
in which we live not at the expense of
the site but in partnership with the
other side
and the truth is that the best place to
begin creating that partnership is here
in the west bank slash trading samaritan
we live close so close to each other
this is precisely what khayatal set out
to do
in roots she got to know a palestinian
and over time they've become good
friends
he lives in hussain an arab village
halfway between alone shuts and
jerusalem
but the political situation does not
make such inter-ethnic friendships easy
signs even warn israelis not to enter
palestinian villages
claiming that it's dangerous hayatal
doesn't agree
she's even learned some arabic because
she wishes to communicate with her
neighbors
are determined to let what they share
and not what separates them
shape their friendship
either we decide now how we can live
together reasonably in peace
or one
[Music]
was detained for four days by
palestinian security forces
the mutual distrust runs so deep that
anyone who has contact with the other
side
is quickly suspected of being either a
traitor or a spy
even so there's something essential the
two share
[Music]
the desire for
it's the personal contacts that make all
the
i have lots of friends here both jews
and arabs
and i'm getting along fine here
in spite of their differences
and rabbi schlesinger have formed a
common bond
they're convinced it's the only way to
bring
peace to their own country
you

Fake mugshots, knocked off millions,  
and a horrifying body count. You caught 
the dramatic doc, but did you get the  
full story? Reckless boozehound to murder 
for hire, here's what Netflix left out!
The Netflix documentary, "Murdaugh Murders:  
A Southern Scandal," devotes itself to the 2019 
boat crash that killed Mallory Beach. Three  
couples — Anthony Cook and Mallory Beach, Connor 
Cook and Miley Altman, and Morgan Doughty and  
Paul Murdaugh — went out on the Murdaugh family 
boat to a party. They started heading back home  
around midnight. But despite Paul being highly 
intoxicated, he wouldn't let anyone else drive.
Episode 2 opens just hours after the crash as 
rescuers frantically search for Mallory. The  
other passengers — except for Mallory's boyfriend 
Anthony who remained at the scene — were rushed  
to the hospital. There, while placed in 
restraints, Paul's blood alcohol level was  
confirmed to be over three times the legal limit. 
Morgan's mom Diane claimed a nurse warned her:
"'I'm not supposed to say this to you, but Paul,  
he's a nasty drunk and you need to get 
away from him as fast as you can.'"
But what wasn't mentioned was how Paul 
was apparently laughing and hitting on  
the nurses. According to the HBO docuseries 
"Low Country: The Murdaugh Dynasty," Paul's  
behavior in the hospital was shocking. 
He appeared unfazed by the tragedy,  
and was seemingly unconcerned about his missing 
friend and the consequences that awaited him.
The Netflix doc  
details the many ways in which Alex Murdaugh 
reportedly tried to get his son's friend Connor  
to be named as the driver of the boat, rather 
than Paul. This ranges from instructing the  
kids not to answer questions and say they 
"don't know" who was driving the boat,  
to claiming to legally represent them 
all, to even contacting Connor's parents.
"And so that night, I'm worried about finding my  
child and they're worried about how 
they're gonna cover up Paul driving."
What the series doesn't mention is 
that Alex is said to have recommended  
attorney Cory Fleming for Connor and his family.
But Cory Fleming is a good friend and 
former college roommate of Alex's — a  
connection that the Cook family was unaware 
of. It would surely be a conflict of interest  
for someone closely tied to the Murdaughs 
to represent the person Alex wanted to take  
the blame. Fleming would later be indicted as a 
co-conspirator in Alex's many financial crimes.
"He already had the plan in 
motion. And we fell for it."
"Mm-hmm."
It was two months after the death of Mallory 
Beach when Paul Murdaugh was charged with  
three felonies; one count of driving a water 
vehicle under the influence resulting in death,  
and two counts of boating under the 
influence resulting in great bodily injury.
But while the Netflix doc provides evidence of 
various parties questioning why Paul hadn't been  
booked into jail yet, it doesn't make clear 
that this actually never happened. Even after  
Paul's indictment, it took an additional 
month before the charges were brought up.
There are statements from his friends' parents 
about how he was never handcuffed. Mallory's  
mother even recounts how his mugshot was taken 
of him in a nice shirt. And while all of that  
is true, it's shocking to discover that Paul 
never even set foot in the police station. He  
was never booked at all. And that mugshot? It 
was taken against a wall outside the courtroom.
Another way Paul was  
apparently given what's referred to as the quote 
"gentleman's treatment" is that the judge who set  
his bond denied the prosecution's request for Paul 
to wear an alcohol monitor. Given that Paul was  
charged with three felonies committed while under 
the influence, this was seen by many as gross  
neglect of duty. It was even brought up on Twitter 
using the hashtag "Souths Good Ol Boy System."
"He never went behind bars, he never had 
handcuffs, never wore the orange suit."
Not only did Paul get sent home to 
wait indefinitely for a criminal trial,  
but he reportedly continued to drink and 
party like nothing ever happened. Paul's  
former girlfriend Morgan says she saw Snapchat 
stories and other social media posts of people  
still partying with Paul. A monitor — which the 
Netflix series never addresses — would have at  
the very least ensured that this underage teen 
was not continuing to abuse alcohol illegally.
It's not until Episode 2 of the Netflix series  
that the main events are discussed in detail. The 
show provides the audio of the 911 call Alex made,  
as well as Alex's timeline of his movements that 
night. But it leaves out significant details.
Reported problems in the Murdaughs' marriage 
are noted, as are the rumors that Maggie had  
hired a forensic accountant and maybe even 
met with a divorce attorney. But the episode  
doesn't reveal that Maggie wasn't living 
at the Moselle house at the time. Instead,  
she had been staying at their beach house in 
Edisto, far from Alex. So why was she at Moselle?
The HBO doc "Low Country" explains that 
Maggie had been living at the beach house,  
but that on June 7, Alex texted her, 
asking to meet up. She apparently even  
discussed the worrying texts with her sister, 
saying Alex was, quote, "up to something."
At the trial, Maggie's sister testified 
that Alex's father was hospitalized  
and that Alex claimed his dad needed 
Maggie's support. After hearing this,  
she agreed to meet him at the Moselle 
house. She was killed that night.
Netflix covers how the survivors of the 2019 
boat crash were each asked to provide an alibi  
for the night of the murder, and how they 
were all cleared of suspicion. But even so,  
the crash was continually linked to 
the murders by many different sources.
"Think this may very well be related 
to the death of Mallory Beach. What  
was the motivation other than anger or revenge?"
But in the "20/20" episode "Murdaugh 
Family Murders," it becomes clear  
why people initially assumed that 
these two events would be related:  
Alex. There's extensive footage 
from Alex at the murder scene,  
in which he frequently mentions the boat crash and 
claims it's the reason his wife and son are dead.
The episode also shows the very 
first interview Alex gave to State  
Law Enforcement. He again brings up the 
crash in connection with the murders,  
saying that Paul had been threatened and targeted. 
Then, when Alex took the stand on February 23,  
2021 his attorney played the 911 call in 
which Alex named the threats regarding the  
crash as the motive. Appearing to 
dictate the narrative, he laments,
"Paw Paw. I should've known."
According to the Netflix doc, two weeks into 
investigating the murders of Paul and Maggie  
Murdaugh, State Law Enforcement reopened the 
case of Stephen Smith's death. Killed in 2015,  
19-year-old Smith was found lying in the middle 
of a road with head injuries. While Alex's oldest  
son, Buster Murdaugh, was mentioned in 
connection with the case, it never led  
anywhere. Stephen's death was labeled 
a hit-and-run, and the case was closed.
"This is not a wreck. This is a murder."
But what the HBO doc reveals is that the only 
reason the coroner called it a hit-and-run is  
because Smith's body was found in the road. 
State police are said to have found the death  
suspicious for various reasons; the complete 
lack of glass or debris at the crime scene,  
the odd position of the body, and the lack 
of injury anywhere else on his person.  
The Netflix show fails to mention that the 
coroner seemingly ignored all this evidence.
Yes, there's an indication that the 
investigation was rushed or covered  
up on behalf of the Murdaughs. But 
the HBO version actually backs this  
up with a statement from Stephen Smith's 
mother. Sandy Smith says that the morning  
Stephen's body was found, Alex's oldest 
brother offered to represent the family.
"Before the sheriff came in, 
Randy Murdaugh was calling."
On September 4, 2021,  
three months after the murders of Maggie and Paul, 
Alex Murdaugh called 911 again. This time, he said  
he'd been shot in the head by an unknown man who 
stopped to help him change his tire. The Netflix  
miniseries addresses the particulars of this 
case, but it leaves out some crucial information.
Alex's injury is listed in the police report 
as a superficial gunshot wound to the head,  
which would seem to corroborate Alex's story. But 
a guest on "20/20" said that the medical report  
revealed the wounds weren't from a gunshot at 
all. Instead, they were likely due to a fall.
Another item left out of the Netflix 
series is how there were 10 shell  
casings found at the scene, which 
doesn't add up to Alex's story at  
all. It was soon revealed that Alex had 
asked his cousin, Curtis "Eddie" Smith,  
to shoot him. Smith confirmed to "20/20" that the 
request was made, but that he never hurt Alex.
"He said, 'I need you to kill me.' I 
said, 'Yeah, that ain't happening.'  
And I figured I was gonna try to scare some sense into him, and I shot the gun up in the air."
On September 6, 2021,  
Alex Murdaugh announced that he was resigning 
from his law firm and entering rehab. He would  
later reveal an opioid addiction. But the 
firm swiftly contradicted this story. The  
law firm was founded in 1910 by Randolph 
Murdaugh Sr., Alex's great-grandfather.  
Netflix mentions the trip to rehab briefly, 
but "20/20" goes into much more detail.
"If anyone wants to see the face of what 
opioid addiction does, you're looking at it."
Mere hours after Alex's statement about 
entering rehab, the firm released its  
own statement saying that Murdaugh 
didn't resign as he claims. Instead,  
he was asked to leave on September 3rd 
— the day before his bizarre roadside  
shooting — because he had misappropriated 
funds from clients and the firm alike.
According to "20/20," Alex was briefly 
removed from rehab to be charged in the  
shooting hoax. He was then charged with 
the theft of the Satterfield settlement.  
The day Alex left rehab, he was charged 
with the murders of his wife and son.
What the Netflix doc doesn't get  
into is just how many financial crimes Alex 
Murdaugh has been accused of. The memo from  
the law firm stating he had been misappropriating 
funds opened the door to dozens of incidents where  
Alex defrauded his clients or embezzled money from 
his firm. All in, it totalled millions of dollars.
A whopping 99 charges have been filed 
related to these findings. But the crimes  
also seemingly provide a motive for the 
deaths of Paul and Maggie. Paul's boating  
accident in 2019 had yet to go to trial, 
but a civil case against him on behalf of  
the Beach family was progressing. A hearing 
was scheduled for June 10 — just three days  
after Paul and Maggie were murdered. That 
hearing was to request an accounting of  
the family's financial records, which 
Alex presumably didn't want to release.
Beach family attorney Mark Tinsley 
told "20/20" that after the murders,  
the hearing was indefinitely canceled. 
And if Maggie was also filing for divorce,  
then Alex's finances would have been 
scrutinized in that scenario, as well.
One of the most egregious of Alex  
Murdaugh's financial crimes is the one perpetrated 
against the family of his former housekeeper,  
Gloria Satterfield. The Netflix series 
covers Satterfield's long relationship  
with the Murdaughs, as well as her death in 2018. 
Satterfield reportedly fell and hit her head on  
brick steps at the home. But the inconsistency 
in the accounting of the incident was troubling.
Alex claimed to be at the scene, talking 
to Gloria, claiming she told him the dogs  
tripped her. But during the 911 call, 
Paul and Maggie's voices are evident,  
but Alex's is not. Witness statements also 
reveal that Alex wasn't there at the time  
of the fall and that Gloria 
never regained consciousness.
"He said I want to make sure 
the boys are taken care of."
The Netflix doc also touches on the plan 
Alex devised to sue himself in order to  
collect from the insurance company for Gloria's 
sons — and his ultimate betrayal in taking the  
entire $4.3 million for himself. But what it 
leaves out is the ending to this tragic tale,  
possibly because filming had wrapped. 
Thankfully, the Satterfield sons were  
awarded over $7.5 million in settlements 
from Murdaugh and his co-conspirators.
Netflix had their  
series in the can before the trial of Alex 
Murdaugh began. And some damning evidence  
from the courtroom is missing from the doc. 
As noted by "20/20," one of the most powerful  
exhibits shown to the jury was a timeline. 
The prosecution's report included GPS data,  
steps data, and second-by-second records 
of all calls and texts between the parties.
Alex placed his 911 call just 19 seconds 
after he arrived at the dog kennels. As the  
prosecution pointed out, this wouldn't have been 
enough time to check the pulses of his wife and  
son — whose bodies were 30 feet apart — before 
he called for help, as he initially claimed.
Other evidence came from Paul Murdaugh's 
phone. One video showed Alex in different  
clothes than he was wearing when 
police arrived. And in a second  
video Paul had taken of a dog at the 
kennels just minutes before his death,  
Maggie and Alex can be heard talking in 
the background, voiding Alex's alibi.
"The State versus Richard Alexander Murdaugh,  
defendant, indictment for 
murder, verdict: guilty."
Jurors needed only 45 minutes to convict 
Alex Murdaugh on both counts. The next day,  
he was sentenced to two life sentences 
without the possibility of parole.

Hello there! How would you like a ticket to one of
the most influential forms of mass communication
the world has ever known?
It’s a universal language that lets us tell
stories about our collective hopes and fears,
to make sense of the world and the people
around us.
I’m talking about film.
You probably figured that out because of the title
of this video, but, yeah, I'm talking about film.
This powerful medium sits in a sweet spot
of human culture: at the intersection of art,
industry, technology, and politics.
It’s inescapable, like FBI piracy warnings,
and trailers that give away the entire movie.
I'm looking at you, Batman v Superman.
And also vs Wonder Woman, apparently,
'cause I learned that from the trailer.
But before we get to a mouse named Mickey,
a little Tramp, and whether or not Han shot first,
we’re going back to the beginning...
In a galaxy far, far–
Well, right here
We have to go all the way back to the beginning
because the creation of this cornerstone of
modern entertainment was basically an accident.
We owe it all to inventors and artists who
were experimenting with new technologies and
trying to capture snippets of reality, to
see the world in a whole new way.
I'm Craig Benzine, and this is
Crash Course Film History.
Ready? Lights! Camera! Action!
Roll the intro now.
We should roll the intro, I think.
[Theme Music]
The term “film” was first used to describe
a specific technology –
a thin, flexible material coated in light-sensitive emulsion
that retains an image after it’s exposed to light.
It’s also the end product of that photochemical
process.
A film is a movie.
But it’s also a verb to describe the
process of capturing moving pictures, as in,
“I’m going to film a movie today.”
Or, “Nick is filming me right this very
second.”
Or, "I'm gonna film a film on film."
Over time, the original film technology has
switched to analog and digital substitutes
– first things like VHS or Beta, and eventually
digital video, like when you record something
on your phone.
Now, at the very beginning of its history,
before all these innovations existed,
film started out as a collection of still images
viewed one after another in rapid succession,
which creates the illusion of motion.
Like what you're seeing right now!
It was a magic trick!
And from that trick came an art form that’s
a blend of literature, drama, photography,
and music.
So how does this illusion actually work?
It all comes down to a couple quirks of human
perception, tricks your eyes play on your brain…
or your brain plays on your eyes… or maybe both.
The 19th century British scholar Peter Mark
Roget was the first to describe one of these
tricks, called Persistence of Vision.
Basically, this is the phenomenon that keeps
you from seeing the black spaces between the
frames of a projected film.
Now, frame can mean a lot of things in film
language, but in this case, it’s what we call one of
the still images that make up a movie.
It turns out that if a frame flashes in front
of your eyes, your brain retains that image for
about a fifth of a second after it’s gone.
If another frame appears within that fifth
of a second, your brain won’t register the
black space between them.
You’ll just perceive the next image.
So when a film flashes 24 frames per second
in front of your eyes, your brain doesn’t interpret it as
24 images separated by flashes of black.
Instead, it looks like a constant picture.
This effect can be combined with another oddity of
perception called the Phi Phenomenon, defined in 1912
by the Czech-born psychologist Max Wertheimer.
Incidentally, "oddity of perception" –
my nickname in high school.
The Phi Phenomenon is an optical illusion
that lets you see a series of images in rapid
succession as continuous motion.
Think of those flip books you played with
as a kid:
Take a series of still pictures, shot or drawn
in sequence, flip them quickly before your
eyes and, voilá! The illusion of motion.
You have yourself a “motion picture,”
or a “moving picture.”
In other words, a moving-picturey.
Better yet, a “movie.”
Write that down, that's what we're going with.
Now, people have been telling stories since
we’ve had language, and they’ve been using pictures
– even animating them – for almost as long.
One line of thinking traces “movies” all
the way back to cave paintings in places like
Chauvet, France or El Castillo, Spain.
You know – those images of animals, trees,
and human figures, painted on stone walls
as far back as 32,000 years ago.
Scientists think the original artists might
have used flickering torchlight to make them
appear to move.
Fast forward to just 5000 years ago, and we find
people inventing more sophisticated devices to
create that same illusion of motion.
Among these pre-film animation tools,
the ones we’re most familiar with are called
zoetropes.
Think of these as a bowl or a deep cylinder
with sequential images painted on the inside
and small slits or windows cut into the edges.
Spin the bowl and peer through the slits and
– thanks to Persistence of Vision and the Phi
Phenomenon – the pictures seem to move.
Oooh!
Over the centuries, these devices came in
lots of different forms and just as many names:
phenakistoscopes, stroboscopes, stereoscopes...
All kinds of ‘scopes. But not Scope,
the mouthwash – that's something else.
And for a long, long time, this is as close
as we ever got to film.
Until photography came along.
Now, it’s important to remember that no one
set out to invent movies.
There was no one mastermind, and no
grand plan to revolutionize communication
or art on a global scale.
If I was around, it would've been me,
but there wasn't anyone.
Instead, film as we know it today exists
because of a series of happy accidents, technical
innovations, and scientific byproducts.
‘Cause really, at the beginning, nobody
knew what they were doing.
Just like now!
I'm lookin' at you, Batman v Superman.
Photography came about in the early-to-mid-19th
century, at a time of great scientific and artistic innovation.
People of means all over the world were tinkering
in their spare time, playing around with technology
and seeing what they could create, combine,
augment, or transform.
Before the photograph was invented, people
were isolating images of the world around
them with devices like the camera obscura.
From the Latin meaning “dark chamber,”
a camera obscura is essentially a box, tent,
or room with a lens or pinhole in one end,
and a reflective surface like a mirror at the other.
Light travels through the hole and displays
an inverted image on the mirror.
Like most of these pre-photography technologies, the camera obscura was mostly a novelty, a toy, or sometimes a tool that let artists create images to study or trace.
As the 19th century dawned, folks started
playing around with photosensitive chemicals,
to figure out their properties while trying
not to melt themselves with acid.
Which we should all try to do, in practice.
In the 1820s, a French inventor named Joseph
Nicéphore Niépce took the first known camera
photograph.
He called it “View from the Window at Le
Gras.”
Niépce used a camera obscura to project an image
onto a pewter plate coated in a light-sensitive chemical.
The areas of the chemical that were hit
with the brightest light hardened, but the areas
touched by weaker light could be washed away,
so a crude permanent record of the original image survived.
Scientists now believe it took a couple days
of exposing the plate to light for the image
to finally show up.
So we’re still a long way from movies!
But we’re getting closer.
Get excited.
Louis Daguerre – another Frenchman, and
a close buddy of Niépce – was able to shorten
the exposure time to just a couple of minutes.
His daguerreotype process became the first
commercially-available, mass-market means
of taking photographs in 1839.
And this is usually considered to be
photography’s birthday.
Hooray!
Happy birthday–
But hold on, the daguerreotype still had a
few problems to work out:
the photographs were pretty fragile, they weren’t easy
to replicate, and the chemicals were, shall we say, toxic.
Along came George Eastman, an American entrepreneur and the founder of Eastman Kodak, who invented a way of taking pictures on paper, rather than metal or glass plates.
This method also didn’t need as many chemicals,
which probably saved a lot of snap-happy inventors
from health problems.
Now photography was off to the races.
Literally.
So let’s go to the Thought Bubble and see
how photographs were used to pause time and
take a closer look at movement.
Take it away, Thought Bubble! Well, I–
I will take it– I'm gonna narrate, so...
In 1872, Leland Stanford, the former governor
of California and a horse race aficionado,
made a bet with another bigwig that a horse
at full gallop raises all four hooves off the ground
at some point.
To settle the bet, Stanford commissioned a
photographer and inventor named Eadweard Muybridge
to find photographic proof.
So, Muybridge set up twelve cameras along
a racetrack, each triggered by a tripwire to capture
a still image of a horse in motion.
His set of twelve photos was something brand
new: rapid motion broken down into frozen,
studiable moments.
Spoiler alert – Governor Stanford
won his bet!
There were a couple images where that horse
wasn’t touching the ground at all.
Muybridge’s experiment launched a wave
of “motion studies,”
as photographers and inventors all over the world
began using these new technologies to break down
continuous motion into individual images.
And that was one giant step closer to motion
pictures.
Thanks Thought Bubble!
You're so great!
One of those photographers was yet another
Frenchman – a man named Étienne-Jules Marey,
whose training in physiology led him to
capture motion studies of birds in flight
and human athletes in action.
Instead of tripwires like Muybridge, Marey invented
what he called a chronophotographic gun (awesome)
and switched from sheets of photographic paper
to rolls, allowing him to take bursts of photographs
– 12 per second.
Even with all these increasingly-fancy techniques,
it’s important to note that these were still just
series of photographs.
Motion studies were sometimes projected,
using devices like Muybridge’s zoopraxiscope,
but nobody was trying to make movies yet.
So, the world was boring.
Each of these innovations set up Thomas Edison and a scientist who worked for him named W.K.L. Dickson to invent the kinetograph – the world’s first motion picture film camera.
And they, in turn, paved the way for the first
filmmakers to experiment with motion picture
technologies and storytelling.
We mentioned earlier that film is an illusion,
but it’s an illusion that’s carefully crafted by people
who want to show a specific point of view.
With aesthetic choices – from shot angle
and shot size to lens type and lighting style
and how much hair you put on a wookie –
filmmakers can further affect how we, as an
audience, interpret reality.
In a real sense, film wasn’t invented,
it was stumbled upon.
A series of happy accidents eventually led
us to Citizen Kane, Grand Illusion, Black Girl,
and the experimental works of Stan Brackage.
Not to mention, things like The Wizard of Oz,
Raiders of the Lost Ark, Captain America: Civil War,
and Sharknado!
There’s a whole world of film out there
to discover, and there’s a lot that film can
help you discover about yourself too.
And that’s the story we’ll continue, next
time we meet.
Today we talked about how film is a sort of
magic trick, thanks to the ways our eyes and
brains work.
Thank you eyes and brains!
We introduced the very, very beginnings of
film, when people started using sequential
images to tell stories.
We discussed photography as a huge technological
leap forward, since chemicals and light could
capture images and break down fast-moving
reality like never before.
And next time, we’ll learn about the very
first motion picture cameras, and the start
of movies as we know them now.

monkey dust is a man-made synthetic drug
that causes extreme paranoia and
hallucinations a hit costs as little as
two pounds and its effects can be filed
after ingesting amounts as small as
three milligrams
Jeannette Jackson has personally seen
the debilitating effects of monkey dust
both lost for sure it's vile because it
just eats them away
you know me they're that hookah tonic
they can't stop using these but you can
see the faces are like getting withdrawn
and you know they're to go and it's by
but for it because it's it's man-made
rock so the comment even gave him
anything to get them off easily
buz Bailey became passionate about
trying to eradicate monkey dust after
discovering that his son Bria had began
to take it Rio was once a top-level
triple and long jumper fleas
he experimented with drugs during his
time at University and was introduced to
monkey dust a year ago now buzz is
prepared to do everything he can to get
rid of dust on the streets of Stoke he
spends his spare time gathering
information educating others and helping
users in the hope that he can save his
son and prevent further addiction
because community group time for action
meet every few weeks to discuss the ways
that they can tackle the epidemic
just your personal appendage you think I
agree do you think we're getting better
it's getting with tip is about body
might agree for opportunity to account
but suggested that we went out and met
some known users to find out more about
dust
nice cup - looking back you get these
cubbies Flambeau I'm in a pipe would you
like me to do one front of you yeah go
for it
ooh don't just see me now so let's go
now sauce over you he money but
you get up for you want man Cheers you
need a DUI Thank You Dustin yeah monkey
does great
no sir what are you doing making a
documentary about monkey-do takers what
do you think of it an element into this
for to you do you know no it's the
roasting going yeah I'm glad you said
that because I think that physical side
effects of dementia psychological
because I mean we can substitute you but
just as addicted to heroin itself and
what would this itself does Saligram are
down the river for a part it's
government
it's my major into the system to divide
us all yeah yeah I stole a good [ __ ]
job and now it's an epidemic
I don't care about talking to them about
you because it'd be another day I'd
rather put my opinion in crisis and as a
user myself lose it at least his
knowledge that's real and right
out sent me please basically since L
first started the monkey dust it's when
these kicked me out to the Salvation
Army yeah yeah and since then before
then I was a clean from 2009 to 2015
from being a prolific house burglar
since these kicked me out and put me
back on the streets back in like manner
dust yeah and now I'm kicking up doors
left right and center yes but what make
shoes up to Dave Jones yeah users tend
to be out at night and sleep in the day
due to the abuse they receive as the
drug is made of readily available and
interchangeable ingredients dealers can
make it in their own homes before
distributing it to users this means that
it's much harder to be detected by
authorities
[ __ ] yeah oh [ __ ] I should get another
big part cake mix they do those things
when they're going about to go crazy
[ __ ] ghosts I'll fill you that bag
fold up tasty I don't see the lines
tired and yours is fluff no one's got
their fourth well so it's stuff a lot no
full fish the main ingredients in full
you made it Gideon's in the floor for
the doctor for firearms powder yeah what
do you mean is I his fire agents no no
you know different Chinese been buns
yeah it's not like marzipan nurse
he wasn't dosed [ __ ] love me sealants
yeah you get dis what smells like gonna
go to pub and you piss on it your idol
you smell lemon you get dust what smells
like that's cool I'll call it bug wash
just kind of stop
[Music]
during a Dustin Joost rage 35 year old
cabin Eagles climbed onto the roof of
his flat where he tad off roof tiles and
launched them on Lucas on the police who
engaged in a six hour long standoff with
him Kevin's family described the ordeal
as a final cry for help after he was
unable to receive any treatment for his
mental health issues due to the lack of
services in the area and an
overstretched NH house our hearts were a
mouse thinking he's gonna fall off the
roof and then it was people saying I
hope he falls off
that's his mom there his brother you
know I mean yeah what about that when I
first saw his flat it was just
devastation cause he lives like I cause
you know his own as a car oh he's
absolutely spotless
so for go and see that you just think
God you know what's happened it's just
that drug must turn him into some demon
proper shows the facts of what the drug
does Donnie
he's just my souls through the roof
smashed all these windows you've sprayed
the window so no one could see in and
realized he can't see out so he
scratched a bit off so he can see out we
fix him once and I don't think you can
fix somebody twice he came a few weeks
before and I said I was getting sexually
and he said you know I wouldn't section
him he'd go on his roof first when he
was ready he knew he needed up and in
his mind he's gone you know what the
only place I'll get off this is by going
prison he realized he was that serious
yeah drew me yeah you know and I think
he's just made that decision ago right
this is what I mean - yeah it doors
massively yeah massively cuz obviously
people watching this won't actually know
what
you going through what it's like to
their first service I don't get
emotional I don't
but I just think if we didn't have him
we'd have no watch that's from the
bottom and the RT says because he's been
that contacted and we don't have no one
to speak to he's been our strength he's
been our rocks
but it's not just users and their
families who have been affected Sara
explains how the rise in dust users is
affecting those being raised in Stoke
today and how her home of thirty-eight
years has been taken over by the drug
her photographic record shows all too
clearly the daily problems they face
I sent the photographs off to four and
peas and counselors that was when the
response started because they were
already fired at what they were seeing
and at that point we were just accepting
it van it was it was quite normal we'd
got hardened to our awful it really was
I didn't want my children growing off
pennies um and I thought you know every
child deserves a chance you know and
they shouldn't have to see these things
that it shouldn't be classed as normal
they shouldn't come out to play football
and kick a couple of unconscious drug
users out of the way cause they're
asleep in gull walls the more they're
perceiving least as normal the moral out
with the are to think well that's what
everybody adores I don't want it for my
children but I also don't want it for
Annie you know as a parent to see your
child go into that lifestyle it's got to
be one of the worst things possible
the community group part for the
homeless founded by Jeanette Jackson was
dedicated to helping rough sleepers and
addicts they provide food and services
like first aid for the homeless five
days a week we started this in 2015 it
was October so the weather just started
going really really cold so we decided
that something else needed to be done
for the homeless
so we actually went on the streets for
twelve months we worked outside bunk
through its outside come to the bus
station and there really finally
security building inside so we've been
here now for about 18 months the council
don't support has one bit in fact
they're against us because of what we do
do we got accused two years ago of
actually encouraging all homeless people
from different parts of stoke-on-trent
call me to happen they just got too hot
me up we all just keep fighting we were
he's got to that point now drastic
actions needed you know if that drastic
action ends up with me going to prison
and so what you know if that's what I've
got do to help save lives in our city
then I'm prepared to do that I may not
be able save my son but if I can stop
somebody else's son daughter brother
sister you know parent even from taking
it then it's got to be a good thing I've
got to keep moving forward it needs to
be reclassified as a class a drug I like
it a separate classification for me for
all of the synthetic stuff for me should
be a double a class drug you know they
should carry any even stiffer sentence
at last questions are being asked to a
political level support charities have
told me they are supporting people who
have actually started using heroin so
that they would be eligible for the
rehab support they have been denied when
trying to get off monkey dust but when
will the government address the problems
of UK cities white Stoke awash with
drugs in the living hell that they
create for both the abusers and locals
like the stogies who want their City
back it's gotta be ho Huntley definitely
I mean

hello welcome to the channel this is
your boy aach so just after BBC released
their documentary on TV Joshua I was
kind of looking forward to certain men
of God to come out to speak about this
documentary men of God like youber Angel
L Alas and Shepherd bushiri because this
men of God In Time past have spoken
highly of TB Joshua and defended him
saying that he's indeed a true man of
God no matter what people have said
concerning him and then his ministry now
in this video I just want to share with
you what prophet Loui Alias said um when
this documentary came out and also what
prophet shepher bushiri had to say now
Prophet shepher bushiri actually posted
about you know his response he posted
his response on his Facebook page and
this is what he had to say
now moving on we have Prophet Loui elas
and then he did a full video talking
about this and then he went on to defend
the man of God TB Joshua so without
wasting any time let's get right into
the video and if today is your first
time on the channel kindly
subscribe I'm coming to you live and um
I've been getting a lot of questions um
about the TP Joshua BBC um document
I think it was called surviving the cult
of uh of tib Joshua I want to talk about
that for a second and I pray that you'll
be blessed and that you'll be
enlightened by the mercies and the power
of God that uh the Lord Jesus will be
glorified and the Lord Jesus will be
lifted uh these are very um strange
times we are in and it requires a
strange uh not not strange but um
profound
understanding profound understanding to
be able to navigate these times it
requires profound understanding to
navigate these times and anyone that is
not profound in understanding and in
seeing the Diabolical agenda that is set
up for the
church many of you are going to be
caught up in the Trap that the enemy has
set for you and uh I pray that God will
give you understanding great great great
understanding to understand why some of
these things are happening
now and they did not happen at a certain
time now understand this uh
primarily there is no one without
sin everyone has messed up now me making
this video by no means am I saying that
uh the man of God never had mistakes I
don't know him personally but I love the
man of God and the man of God was used
by God and anyone who says otherwise
it's just you don't know Jesus if you
think that the man was uh was used
demonically or
satanically uh if you truly read
scripture you will know who this man was
now that doesn't mean that he didn't
have mistakes now do I know his mistakes
I I don't know I didn't live with him
but everybody has mistakes the only one
that is perfect is the king of glory the
lord Jesus
now the number one thing that you have
to realize is this the world thrives of
negativity
negative things sell more than anything
that is positive that is the first thing
now you need to ask
yourself what is the
motive of making a video or making a
documentary about a man who can't defend
himself that is the first red flag
anyone that has any kind of
wisdom the primary thing is always to
make sure you don't go with one side of
the
story now when the man was alive I
remember this when the man was alive
there are people who are paid to frame
him on stories if they've paid people to
frame me create stories about me and I'm
nowhere lifted as this man uh was in his
day God is taking me somewhere I haven't
arrived there yet but if they could pay
people to create stories about me if
they could do things to frame
me how much more for a man who took over
a for Christ took over the world for
Christ so the number one thing is you
have to ask yourself I'm not here to
give you uh my opinion I'm here to ask
you questions that you need to question
yourself with the first thing
is why are you going to create something
that a man is not alive to defend
himself why didn't they make this
documentary when he was
alive that is the first
issue
number
two how can we
verify that the people on the on on on
the documentary what they saying is
completely the truth how can that be
verified there is no evidence other than
their words right now maybe he did do
them wrong maybe he didn't do them wrong
Whatever May the case may be but the
question is
this how
can we
verify that what is being said is
true we don't know
that number
[Music]
three why are Christians celebrating
something that the world doesn't believe
in your Jesus the guys who created this
documentary are not
believers they don't believe in the Lord
Jesus they don't believe in church they
don't believe in Salvation they created
this for clicks and for likes right
that's why they made this all
documentary why are you celebrating
something that the world has created
what do you think they are setting the
stage for do you think any of you
pastors are
safe how do you think the persecution of
the church will come and how how do you
think they're going to justify
[Music]
it when they can make a documentary
about a faith they don't believe in to
tarnish you do you think Muslims don't
have controversies do you think Hindus
don't have controversies why is it that
they're only making videos about
Christians you foolish people you can't
see what they're doing they are setting
us up and many of you pastors and and
and evangelists are going to be foolish
enough to to to talk about this and and
tarish somebody and this and that and
that and that you're idiots you don't
get it they setting you up No One Is
Safe
anymore no one is safe
anymore how do you think they're going
to justify persecuting
you how do you think that's going to
happen when they start shutting down
your
churches when they start using another
person let's assume the prophet was
actually an evil man but they start
using him to judge all of us how do you
think you're going to escape that when
they have portrayed an image not to the
church to the world to have an idea of
what Christianity is on mouths of people
we can't truly
verify okay we can't verify any of the
things because it's he say she say I was
I was there's no evidence everybody's
just telling their own
story we can't verify anything and we
don't have the man's witness to defend
himself but but many of you are going to
go online you're going to see your
pastors telling you you see we told you
it was a devil first of all let's go to
scripture let's go theological for a
second let's be theologically sound the
Lord Jesus says this nobody calls Jesus
Lord except by the spirit of God so
anyone that is telling you this man is a
wizard yet the man is casting out demons
in the name of the Lord Jesus the man is
telling you to give your life to Jesus
already we know whoever is judging him
based on saying you a wizard but you can
use the name of Jesus and lead people to
Salvation we know for a fact you don't
even believe the Bible you preach
because now you are arguing with the
words of the Lord
Jesus you are arguing with the words of
the Lord
Jesus I I want you to be sober and think
about this for a
second I want you to think they are
saying that all the Miracles were
arranged
all this were this all this were that
all this were that we can't verify
that but
notice you guys don't understand they're
coming for your church you Christians
you don't get
it if it was done by one of us as
Believers you know one of the one of the
the documentaries I really love and I
watched them years years ago was called
God's
generals
the the the documentary was called God's
generals now in God's General it spoke
about William Branham it spoke about the
Maria Woodward era it spoke about all
these Great Men of God it pointed out
the great they did it pointed out the
mistakes they
made and that is one of the best books
you can ever read to understand the
ministries of the generals that were
there before
us it showed the good that they did and
he showed their errors where they were
in Doctrine where they were wrong where
they missed it for the Next Generation a
to do
better now you tell me when the world is
making a documentary about you notice
all the all the all the shots they used
were spooky shots of tib Joshua making
people fall under the power of God which
is
100% sound nothing wrong with that but
the world won't see it like that because
they don't understand it it's like when
Jesus peit on the ground put mud on
somebody's eyes it doesn't make sense to
the
world we just increased Islam we just
validated Islam which we know is 100%
false you just validated all these other
religions because they cannot attack
Islam because if they attack Islam is
going to be uh discrimination they
cannot attack Buddhism because of
Buddha but they always have always
attacked christianities every time they
make documentary nobody's making the
videos about what is happening in Saudi
or happening in Iraq or Iran or all
these places where where it's controlled
by Muslim no one is going to do that
because the world will not accept accept
it but Christians are a punching bag and
we have made it okay for us to be a
punching
B don't fall for the
Trap even if the man did Evil the good
he did outweighs the
evil and I'm using an
if if the man did
Evil how many families did he feed how
many people got delivered how many
people had the gospel I'm sure the man
had mistakes like every other
person why are we celebrating the
downfall of others what is wrong with
us why are we celebrating the Tanish of
others I'm just telling you to be
wise I wouldn't waste my time watching
that it makes absolutely no sense to me
the world cannot tell me how to look at
Jesus the spirit of God will tell me how
to look at Jesus and how to judge his
servants how to know who is true and who
is not true not out of the mouths of
people that you can't validate anything
or prove anything because the man is not
even there to defend
himself I remember that there's a lady
with crooked eyes on there there's a few
videos of her with Prophet TI
Joshua her taking back a statement
saying who sent her how she was she she
did that a few times you guys don't
don't know it cuz I followed the man's
Ministry back in the so when I saw I
said yo I recognize this
woman be wise
people be wise many of you are falling
for a trap that has been set for the
church if they can if they can do that
to a man that is
dead who can't defend himself you think
you're safe you think Christianity is
safe you don't understand what is coming
but I pray that God will give you the
wisdom and the
understanding that you will escape the
snare and the trap the enemy has set for
the
church that we will escape
it this was made with people who had a
bias and they only put people who had
biases they didn't put people on the
other side because of what they wanted
to portray and it's good regardless of
it it will not erase anything this man
did it cannot it will never erase it it
cannot undo it whatever God's hand is on
you you can turn it on yeah whatever
God's hand is on no one can do anything
about it it is
established so I pray that the Lord
Jesus will bless you that you will have
the wisdom needed to na at this wicked
world we are living
in I believe in Prophet Joshua's
Ministry I will always believe in it
because I know the Lord Jesus walked
with this man and if he had
mistakes it reveals the grace and the
power of God even more nobody calls
Jesus Lord except by the spirit of
[Music]
God the devil does not cast out Satan or
should I say Satan doesn't cast out
Satan
always remember that so when they come
and tell you he's using demonic power
and he's saying in the name of Jesus
come
out anyone who tells you otherwise just
ask them do you really read the Bible do
you believe the Lord Jesus if they
believe the Lord Jesus and they can make
a statement like that just know they
don't actually believe the Bible they
believe what they believe they believe
in their own theology not the word of
God and you'll notice it's people who
are powerless that talk like that or
speak like that no people who have
actually been endowed with The Graces of
God true genuine Grace
so I pray for grace for you and
um that's what I got so many emails I
got so many DMS people asking me about
this so I thought it was good for me to
speak on it I love Prophet TI Joshua and
I am praying for synagogue the church uh
that the Lord will truly truly fight for
it and that the legacy of his servant
will not go down if by this standard is
what we are judging then you guys should
stop reading David stop reading about
David David was a matter
too stop reading about Moses stop
reading about all these people stop
reading about Solomon close your
Bibles I don't see anybody making an
exposure video of
David Wise up become wiser may God bless
you and keep you

On the 26th of February, 1919, 
the Grand Canyon in Arizona  
officially became the 15th National 
Park of the United States of America.  
The canyon - actually a gorge of the Colorado 
River - and the many tributary canyons which  
surround it, are mostly comprised of extremely 
rugged and sheer terrain, although areas along  
the North and South Rim have been maintained 
and cultivated for the purposes of tourism.  
Dangers abound within the canyon itself, but even 
from well-maintained tourist areas on the rim it  
is surprisingly common for people to fall to their 
death, often in ways that completely defy belief.
National Parks in America are protected areas 
of wilderness selected for their natural beauty,  
their unique geology and ecosystems, and for the 
abundant opportunities for hiking, exploring,  
and other recreation that they offer. The Grand 
Canyon National Park is among the most popular,  
and is indeed considered to be one of 
the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
Millions of people visit the Grand 
Canyon National Park each year,  
most of them without incident. They come to 
see the mind-bendingly vast gorge itself,  
to hike some of the many trails within it, to 
observe ancient rock art and geological formations  
and sometimes to enjoy river rafting 
or helicopter flights over the canyon.
To a casual visitor the idea that someone might 
fall from the rim into the canyon itself can seem  
absurd. The gorge is so vast, so unmissable, and 
so obviously hazardous that it seems only logical  
that it should inspire caution in all those who 
venture close to it... and yet records exist of  
more than 50 falls, the majority fatal, over 
the course of the National Park's existence.  
Most of these falls occurred not in 
remote areas off the beaten path,  
but instead at popular, busy viewing areas. 
Specifically because of the high number of  
visitors many of the most popular sightseeing 
areas have been fitted with railings or walls  
as well as highly-visible signs warning tourists 
to stay on the trails and away from the edge. To  
further mitigate the danger every visitor to 
the National Park is given either a pamphlet  
or a verbal warning describing the most prominent 
risks to life. Rangers patrol on a regular basis,  
speaking to visitors whenever they can to 
curtail any dangerous behavior... and yet still,  
despite all of this, falls do occur. Three causes 
predominate when it comes to falls from the rim.  
First and foremost people tend to fall when 
trying to take, or pose for, striking photographs.
While death in pursuit of a selfie might 
seem like a relatively modern phenomenon,  
the first fall of this kind occurred at a 
surprisingly early point in the canyon's history.  
On the 22nd of March, 1925, 40-year-old Lewis 
W Thompson was attempting to take a picture of  
himself standing on the rim of the canyon. While 
stepping to one side to better frame his picture  
he lost his footing and plummeted to his death.  
Since then dozens of other tourists have also 
passed away in pursuit of the perfect photograph.  
Among them is 20-year-old John Eric Hastrick. On 
the 27th of April, 1981, Hastrick was attempting  
to take a photo not of the canyon but of the 
Bright Angel Lodge hotel on the South Rim.  
Seeking a better angle, he 
clambered over a guardrail and,  
with his camera viewfinder glued to his eye, 
walked backwards towards the lip of the abyss.  
He went over the edge and fell to his death 
before he could line up the shot he wanted.
Almost two decades later, on the 19th of 
August, 1999, 25-year-old Gabriel Comerford  
was visiting Moran Point on the South Rim. 
He wanted a souvenir photo and, being alone,  
asked some fellow tourists if 
they would help him take one.  
They readily agreed, and Comerford handed them 
his camera. He then clambered over the guardrail,  
walked out onto a narrow precipice, lost 
his footing, slipped down a rocky slope  
and fell into the void. Not knowing what else 
to do, the tourist with his camera used it to  
take several photographs of Comerford's final 
moments - not the souvenir he would have wanted.
Many other people have also fallen victim to the 
desire for the perfect picture on the edge of the  
Grand Canyon. Despite this it is interesting to 
note that on almost any visit to the Grand Canyon  
National Park many many visitors can be seen 
in almost any popular viewing area traveling  
beyond the railings, clambering onto precarious 
ledges, or taking other incredible risks in  
order to pose for pictures. The second common 
cause of falls from the rim is more nebulous,  
but relates to the sheer scale of the canyon. 
Numerous reports exist of visitors being overcome  
with dizziness or a sense of vertigo when sitting 
on the canyon edge. One striking incident of  
this type took place on the 9th of March, 1989. 
34-year-old tourist Gesela Elixmann took a seat  
on the very edge of the canyon at Mojave Point on 
the South Rim, and enjoyed the spectacular view.  
When she tried to stand and move away from 
the edge, however, she was overcome with  
dizziness and fell to her death. Just three 
days later the same thing happened again.  
21-year-old tourist Yuri Nagata was visiting 
the West Rim's Second Trailview Overlook as  
part of a group tour. As they arrived at 
the viewing area the tour group leader  
addressed the group, telling them of the 
terrible incident involving Elixmann.  
Nagata dutifully listened to this cautionary 
tale and then immediately walked to the railing,  
crossed it, and took a seat on the rim of 
the canyon. When one of her friends asked  
her to stand and pose for a picture she, just like 
Elixmann, lost her balance and fell into the void.
While two identical incidents taking 
place so close together is rare,  
the story echoes throughout the history of the 
canyon. Before Nagata and Elixmann there was  
21-year-old Elizabeth Hazelhurst who, in 1971, 
sat on the rim of the canyon with friends and  
fatally lost her balance when she tried to stand. 
Before her there was 17-year-old Herbert E Kolb  
who, in 1947, died in exactly the same manner 
after watching the sunset from the rim with his  
girlfriend. In each case the victim took what they 
perceived to be a small risk: they sat on the edge  
of the canyon to take in the view - the very last 
view they would ever see. Thirdly, and finally,  
a small but significant number of falls have been 
caused by, quite simply, the desire to show off.  
On the 28th of November, 1992,  
38-year-old Greg Austin Gingrich was visiting the 
park with his family. The group were hiking along  
the South Rim when Gingrich saw an opportunity 
to play a practical joke on his teenage daughter.  
He planned to clamber up onto the low stone wall 
that separated the path from the canyon edge,  
then pretend to lose his balance 
and tumble off towards the void.  
He would then hop down onto a 
ledge on the other side of the wall  
and hunker there for a moment or two - just long 
enough to give his daughter a fright - before  
popping back up and revealing himself to 
be unharmed. His prank didn't go to plan.  
The moment Gingrich landed on the ledge he 
lost his footing and toppled over into the  
canyon proper. He dropped without making a sound, 
perhaps too shocked by his fatal miscalculation  
to even cry out as he fell. The target of his 
practical joke - his teenage daughter - was used  
to her father playing tricks on her. Unaware that 
he had actually fallen she carried on up the path,  
expecting him to follow as soon as 
he saw that his joke hadn't landed.  
She had walked all the way to the car park 
and met up with the rest of their group  
before she realized that anything was truly amiss. 
It would be past nightfall before a search and  
rescue team would find Gingrich's body and fully 
confirm that his final prank really had gone  
too far. Similarly showing off may have been a 
factor in another death on the 8th of September,  
1993. 51-year-old James Merriman was a Flagstaff 
resident who periodically rode his bicycle  
out to the Grand Canyon in order to crawl 
through the railings at popular tourist spots  
and gather coins from ledges, where 
tourists would throw them for good luck.  
Merriman would often camp in the canyon 
during these coin-collecting expeditions,  
and was known to park rangers. Indeed, just a 
week before they had been called to rescue him  
when he got into difficulty and became 
stuck on a ledge while gathering coins.
This incident, it appears, did not deter 
Merriman from his money-making scheme.  
On the 8th of September he visited Mather Point 
on the South Rim. Having clambered out past  
the railing and gathered some coins he found 
that he had a spellbound audience of tourists.  
Confident in his abilities, Merriman began 
jumping back and forth between two rocks,  
inviting the watching crowd to take his 
picture. His final words were, simply,  
"Watch me!" No sooner had he uttered them than 
he lost his footing and plunged to his death.
Again these are just a few 
incidents from a catalogue of many.  
Numerous unfortunate souls - the vast majority 
young and male - have suffered fatal falls while  
demonstrating their nerve and sure-footedness on 
the edge of one of the largest chasms on earth.
While it may seem improbable that anyone should 
fall into the Grand Canyon when the danger posed  
by it is so evident, it can and does happen. It 
is easy to decry the victims of these incidents as  
foolish, and to lament their lack of sense... but 
it is also important to remember that their lives  
were cut short by a simple lapse of judgment 
- a momentary misunderstanding or failure to  
appreciate the danger before them. In each case 
it was a brief and terrible miscalculation,  
made in a matter of seconds, the consequences of 
which consumed the entire rest of their lives.

Hello, citizens of AutoDale, and welcome to tonight's PSA.
What is a model citizen?
"Well, I'm home."
"How was work today, honey?"
"It was a delight."
Well, families of AutoDale,
a model citizen is a providing father.
A model citizen is a caring mother.
All in service of a scrappy young boy or girl.
A model child, raised by a model family to become a model citizen of their own.
For AutoDale is hardly automatic.
You and your families are the gears that keep our engines turning and turning.
And let us hope that this perfect cycle never ends.
"Joe!"
Greetings, Mr. And Mrs. Robinson.
Daily check. How are we doing tonight?
"Well, work was a delight."
"Oh, dinner was just wonderful."
"And Junior's just been tucked in."
Splendid! Taking after his father, I hope.
Seems everything's in order.
"Leaving so soon?"
"You wouldn't care to join my lovely lady for a dance, would you, Joe?"
One day, Mrs. Robinson. Not today.
"Aw."
"You disappointed the lady, Joe."
Deepest apologies, Robinson family, but duty calls.
It would seem the cycle never ends.
And when the time comes...
...when your model child is grown up and is ready to start a model family of their own,
a true model citizen knows that their duties are finished and their course has run.
"I think it's time."
"I was... kind of hoping that the cycle would never end."
[thunder claps]
"I'm so proud of him."
"We did good."
You did indeed, Robinsons.
True...
...Model Citizens.
"Thank you, Joe."
Deepest apologies, Robinsons. Duty calls.
I'm afraid Autodale is hardly automatic.
...and your families are what keep our engines turning and turning.
Let us hope that this perfect cycle never ends.
Hello, this is David. I hope you all enjoyed your return to Autodale. Special thanks to:
Ashley, Ryan Turpin, Devin V., Liz Lizzy Lizard,
Layered Ear, Ninja of Orthanc, Triskellios, Sam Millson,
Cullen Kelley, Connor Hewitt, Viridian, Victoria,
George Storey, Guardian of Energy, and Brooke Watson.
Thanks guys.

Oh, hi Danny come on in.
Looks like you’re having
some trouble with addition.
Now don’t be upset.
You’re here to learn.
And we learn from mistakes.
Everybody makes mistakes.
Nuh-uh.
Look at this question here.
What is 2 + 2?
See you wrote 22.
But when we do addition we don’t just
put the numbers next to each other.
That’s stupid.
Alright, think about it this way.
If I have two markers in this hand...
...and then I add the two markers from this hand...
How many markers do I have now?
Twenty-two!
No, Danny. It’s four.
Mrs. Wells?
We’re Danny’s parents.
Oh yes! Hello. Please, come in.
Now don’t worry. It’s completely normal for kids to get frustrated when they’re struggling with a subject.
So what’s this about Danny getting some
answers wrong on this so-called test of yours?
We had a test. One of the questions was what is 2 + 2.
Danny answered 22.
And?
And that’s not the right answer.
Says who?
Says math.
Are you calling my son stupid?
No, of course not!
Who are you to say that your
answer is right and that his is wrong?
No no, she’s right.
Thank you.
Right out of Nazi Germany.
You can’t honestly tell me that you
don’t know what two plus two equals.
So you’ve got it all figured out, don’t you.
You smart-ass little tramp.
Uhhhhhh
Uhhhh uhhhhh uhhhhh.
What are you? Some kind of retard?
Alright! I’m sorry, I’m not going to
be able to continue this conversation.
We’re going to complain to the principal about you.
Danny is a free thinker!
I’ll have your job, bitch.
Not if you can’t add two and two together you won’t.
Mrs. Wells.
Oh, sorry Principal. I didn’t see you.
I understand you had an issue yesterday
with the parents of one of our students.
It did get a little crazy.
When things get out of hand I really
need you to let me know about it.
Sure. So how do you want to handle it?
I guess you could apologize.
Apol- What? His mom hit me!
I understand you told Danny he had
a wrong answer on his test.
He did have a wrong answer on his test.
It’s not our job to tell students
when they’re right and wrong.
That is exactly what our job is.
Parents don’t want you ramming your
biased views down their kids’ throats.
That’s not biased. That’s how math works.
You know what doesn’t work? Your attitude.
Maybe I can explain this in math terms,
so you can understand.
If you took all the kids in this classroom,
and divided them by zero,
that’s exactly the amount of respect you’re giving them.
Something you’d like to say?
You can’t divide a number by zero and get zero.
So now I’m stupid.
Just some crazy administrator doing paper work,
while you superstar teachers change the world!
Students Count! Teachers Divide!
Stop undermining our kids’ confidence!
Are you going to apologize to the parents?
Why did you even start teaching if you hate children?
Please have a seat, Mrs. Wells.
Thank you.
You know, I honestly think this will all
blow over if we just wait a week or so.
I’m afraid we can’t do that.
Why not?
They’re suing.
For what?
Emotional distress to a minor.
Mrs. Wells, can you please tell
the members of this board
exactly when you became aware of this fiasco
and the events leading up to the riot.
Riot?
I just told a student that two plus two equals four.
We need for you to recant that.
What?
Just say that you’re open to the possibility that
there might be multiple correct answers.
But that’s not true.
We can’t let them bully us.
This is so stupid!
Stupid. That’s your problem.
Anyone who disagrees with you is stupid.
There is nothing to disagree with.
There is only one correct answer.
For your sake, I certainly hope you have that correct answer when the media gets wind of this.
I do. It’s four.
I have my own answer.
This school minus you equals tomorrow.
You’re firing me?
Suspending. While you reconsider your extremist views.
You brought this on yourself.
TV: Breaking News.
In what’s being called Mathgate
an activist elementary school teacher was caught abusing her student’s First Amendment Rights.
So this teacher, this liberal elitist,
tells this innocent little first-grade kid
that his answer is wrong. Only her answer is acceptable.
Yeah, from what I hear, she doesn’t even keep
these students for more than a year.
After that, they all leave her and go to another teacher.
It’s called graduating!
It’s creating some good healthy debate in this country.
Some experts say that 2 + 2 = 4. Others say that it’s 22.
No they don’t!
If you hate America that much,
why don’t you just go teach in Commie France.
Hello?
(Principal) Hello, Mrs. Wells.
The Board decided that for everyone’s benefit,
your services will no longer be required.
For everyone’s benefit?
How about the kids?
I need you to come by the school tomorrow.
We don’t want you radicalizing our students anymore.
Mrs. Wells, thank you so much for coming.
I’m just so sorry it happened this way.
If only you’d been willing to be more open-minded.
About math? What about academic integrity?
You were warned. Given an explanation.
And yet you persisted.
But we will of course fulfill our financial obligations.
Now, that’s $2,000 for your last pay period,
and $2,000 for this one.
So that’s $4,000.
Wrong.
It’s twenty-two thousand!

1936 and France is having an election so
French politics at this point can
largely be described as a dumpster fire
they were divisive violent and ruling
was extremely difficult this election
was won by a left-wing coalition called
the Popular Front with a man called Leon
Blum taking over as Prime Minister
sidenote France did have a president at
this point but he wasn't important
anyway with the elections behind them in
a clear mandate you'd think that
governing France would be less difficult
but fun fact no the government needed to
sort out the economy because Great
Depression which was made more difficult
in large scale strikes broke out across
the country these were settled with what
were called the Matignon agreements
which saw the introduction of a 40-hour
workweek as well as better paying
conditions blooms government also had to
deal with the right-wing paramilitary
league they're quite a few the cross a
file at by Army veteran Francois della
Roque the government came up with a
subtle way of doing this
they banned them this didn't stop
conservatives in France from fearing the
worst though in fact many believed that
the victory of the Popular Front with
its communist support heralded the
coming of a communist revolution in
France with the support of the USSR
these fears were misplaced though in the
Popular Front would suffer from the same
instability in infighting that the
previous coalition's had dealt with Blum
resigned in 1937 and was replaced by
Camilla Chantal who frankly didn't do
much
his government collapsed in early 1938
and thus Blum returned for less than a
month Blum was replaced by Edouard
Daladier in April until a da's
government was focused not on france's
internal problems but instead upon
germany which are recently annexed
Austria which it wasn't supposed to do
this was followed up by Germany's leader
a certain Adolf Hitler from demanding
this area the Sudetenland from france's
staunch ally czechoslovakia this
resulted in a Munich conference whereby
France and Britain agreed that Germany
would be allowed to annex the
Sudetenland Czechoslovakia itself wasn't
invited to this meeting because they'd
only do things like disagree it should
be noted the very few in France were
willing to tolerate the idea of war at
this point both sides of the political
spectrum were filled with pacifists who
believed that the cost of war as
demonstrated by the devastation of the
First World War were never worth it
France was very proud of the Munich
Agreement and saw it as a great victory
in Tula da's popularity soared until
Hitler conquered the rest of
Czechoslovakia that is Frances
appeasement of Hitler's territorial
ambitions could only go so far Germany
invaded Poland on September the 1st 1939
into
later France declared war on Germany
alongside Britain what followed was not
an intense push into Germany but what
the French called the troll de Guerre or
as is known in English the phoney war
this was basically when neither side did
much except clash at sea because the
French did not wish to push into Germany
in Germany could not push into France
the reason for this was the extremely
potent line of fortifications called the
Maginot Line this wasn't designed to be
impenetrable but was supposed to force
Germany to go around through Luxembourg
and Belgium because better to fight a
war there than at home till a ta now saw
the Communist Party is a potential
threat because the USSR had signed a
non-aggression pact with the Third Reich
the molotov-ribbentrop pact this led to
many communists being arrested and
forced into exile there was still a
sizable movement of people who wanted
peace it's just too early on patriotism
ran high this lasted until
franco-british relations hit a few snags
this was because the British botched the
defense of Norway which soon fell to the
Germans the failures here led to de la
da being ousted and replaced by a man
called Paul Reynaud the phoney war came
to an end in May of 1940 when Germany as
the Maginot Line dictated push through
Belgium to advance into France they also
took the Netherlands because why not
long story short the German army pushed
their tanks through a heavily forested
area which wasn't accounted for they
then came into contact with some poorly
trained French recruits broke through
and then pushed a wedge between the
French forces to the south and the
franco-british forces to the north the
British retreated to Dunkirk where they
then bravely ran away as French troops
fought to cover their retreat it was
extremely brutal and bloody fighting the
British now believed that France was
doomed to fallen so refused to commit
resources to a defense which deeply
strained the alliance France began to
collapse at this point which was
hastened by Italy joining the war
against them - on the 14th of June Paris
was captured and reynor after refusing
to hold peace talks resigned on the 16th
this was after people in both the French
and British governments proposed a
radical plan to keep France fighting the
franco-british Union this was where both
nations would be merged into one under a
single government and military command
was trained on Churchill with strong
supporters of the move it was rejected
by other French ministers because too
many of them they were simply being
asked to choose between domination by
the Germans or by the British after
Reyna was gone it was his deputy in one
of the main proponents of an armistice
who took over for him a certain Philippe
Petain on the 22nd of June at Compiegne
the same place Germany signed its
armistice at the end of World War 1
France agree to peace on German
these terms these word that one France
would be divided into two zones and
occupied zone in the north which the
French would pay for in a free zone in
the south to the French fleet would stay
in their home ports but the Germans
would leave them alone three the French
army was limited to one hundred thousand
men and for all French prisoners would
remain in captivity until Britain made
peace Britain did not believe that
condition number two would be honored
and so sent an automaton to the French
and over your ships docked in North
Africa over to us or else the French
said no because they'd agreed not to in
the armistice and so the Royal Navy
attacked killing over a thousand French
sailors and crippling the fleet there to
put it mildly the French government was
furious this new French government was
based at the town of Vichy and pétain
sought to secure his new government he
saw a greater powers for his position so
he could push through far-reaching
reforms Petain believed that France had
suffered a catastrophic defeat because
its people had become weak many in
France a green and Petain was voted
massive emergency powers to basically
rewrite the French Constitution however
he wished he did three things he
abolished the presidency he made himself
head of the French state with near
absolute legal powers and he dismissed
Parliament the new regime officially
called the French state but better known
as Vichy France operated in tandem with
the Germans French volunteers served
with the German army the Vichy regime
conducted air raids against her alter
many Frenchmen went to work in German
industry many of those who fought with
the Germans were simply stringent
anti-communist and even held the motto
better Hitler than Blum
although please be aware that many of
those who served in the factories did
this simply out of desperation and
others did it because they were forced
to the third French Republic was over at
least officially that is there were
those both inside and outside of France
who had refused to accept the Armistice
and wanted to continue the fight against
Germany inside of France the French
Resistance was formed and operated in
both occupied and Vichy France they
undertook sabotage espionage and
assassinations to weaken German and
Vichy forces the French Resistance
wasn't simply one group of people it's
the collective name for various groups
early on resistance was mounted by
conservative and Catholic groups but
after the German invasion of the USSR in
1941 Stalin authorized communist groups
to resist - outside of France Britain in
the remnants of the French military
which had fled attempted to group these
resistance fighters under the umbrella
of the French forces of the Interior
which was to be led by a certain Charles
de Gaulle however the Communists weren't
interested in working with the
conservative to güell
many Frenchmen saw him as nothing more
than a British puppet and a traitor this
viewpoint changed as the war turned
against Germany whose advance into the
Soviet Union had stalled to make matters
worse the US had joined the war and
along with the rest of the Allies in the
Free French were advancing across North
Africa as the Vichy and German forces
were pushed back to Gaul began to gain
legitimacy and many French soldiers
deserted to him and turned against the
Vichy government so de Gaulle had a
difficult relationship with the British
and the Americans he was largely left
out of decision-making not treated as an
equal and Roosevelt was also willing to
work with Vichy France whom he saw as
more legitimate and potentially more
useful that was until November 1942 when
the Germans decided to put an end to
Vichy France and along with the Italians
invaded in order to seize the French
fleet Vichy France his last act was to
scuttle most of the fleet at Toulon as
French sailors held off the German
soldiers attempting to seize them anyway
the war continued to move in the Allies
favor by 1944 the Allies decided to
finally invade France
On June the 6th 1944 better known as
d-day the Allies landed their forces in
Normandy and gained a foothold in August
the Allies mostly American and Free
French forces landed in southern France
and pushed to here so de Gaulle would
achieve his dream of liberating Paris on
the 25th of August 1944 this was done
with very little fighting in the city
itself with a general Leclerc did engage
in heavy fighting south of Paris a
provisional government were set up with
de Gaulle as its head and whilst France
most certainly aided with the continued
advance into Germany for many notably
those in the resistance the war was over
pertain incidentally was taken to
Germany and later returned to France
where he was arrested after Germany's
capitulation in 1945 France was given
zones of occupation in Germany in
Austria but be aware this was not a sure
thing
President Roosevelt and later President
Truman believed that since many
Frenchmen had fought alongside the
Germans that they would be treated as a
conquered nation Britain was against
this and in the end the Americans
acquiesced in France was to be treated
as a victorious power in case you're
wondering Britain wasn't doing this to
be nice it simply meant that a rearmed
France would be the primary military
defender of Western Europe which was not
a position that the Brits wanted with
the war over de Gaulle now had the
difficult job of rebuilding the French
government in the country the French
state and appertain was gone and so de
Gaulle sought to create the fourth
French Republic which wouldn't suffer
from the weaknesses of the third spoiler
alert it did dugu reinstated the
previously elected officials and
on trial who was found guilty and given
life in prison by 1946 a new
constitution had been approved an
election saw the communist party win the
most seats but it was Leon Blum who
returned as Prime Minister France over
the next few years received immense sums
of money from the USA in the Marshall
Plan to rebuild and join the Cold War
against the USSR despite the popularity
of the Communist Party there so France
was devastated by the second world war
one of the things Charles DeGaulle was
hoping to do was to rebuild French
prestige in Europe France joined the UN
Security Council as a permanent member
rebuilt its military and sought to find
its new role in the world ultimately
world war two's legacy in France is very
complicated France still struggles with
determining whether or not Vichy France
was legitimate whether or not surrender
was better than fighting to the bitter
end and to what extent the liberation of
France was a French one I hope you
enjoyed this episode and thank you for
watching and a special thanks to Thomas
guest Strich Adam Harvey Winston Cawood
and James businet if you'd like to know
more about France during the Second
World War there are some book

Cannabis contains about 500 different
chemical compounds most people are
familiar with THC main chemical and
cannabis that gets you high but another
important chemical in the plant is
cannabidiol or CBD along with THC CBD is
frequently used for medical purposes the
doses of these cannabinoids vary
depending on the type of cannabis and
how its consumed many people assume that
all cannabis is the same but like wine
and hard liquor the sheer number of
options especially in a legal market can
be overwhelming despite the countless
strains all cannabis can be categorized
into three main species sativa indica
and ruderalis many familiar with the
plan have heard of cannabis sativa known
for its energetic stimulating head highs
and cannabis indica known for its
relaxing body highs but there are also
hybrids which are typically part sativa
and part indica hybrids are common and
offer a body head-high combination that
varies depending on the particular
strain finally cannabis ruderalis isn't
discussed grown or consumed nearly as
often as the other varieties because
ruderalis plants don't get very large
and then flowers contain low levels of
THC each of these cannabis species comes
in a plethora of strains with their own
effects tastes smells and levels of THC
and CBD once the type of cannabis is
chosen it can be consumed and prepared
in several different ways you can smoke
it
to food court consumed in the oil form
smoking the plant is the most common
method of consumption because it's easy
and inexpensive
additionally pots effects are almost
instantaneous when smoked and it's
obvious when you've had enough vaporized
cannabis has the same rapid onset and
ease of titration while removing
possible negative effects of smoking in
people with respiratory problems another
common method of consuming cannabis is
oil which can be eaten put into capsules
vaporized or smoked oil is typically
used for medical purposes or buy
cannabis enthusiasts seeking a better
high a less common way to use canvas is
topically with cream or ointment these
methods don't cause any psychoactive
effects but work to treat some medical
conditions finally eating cannabis is
becoming increasingly popular especially
with Colorado and Washington states
legalizing the plan edible cannabis
products like cakes and candies are
controversial however as it's easy to
eat too much and have an unpleasant
experience especially as a novice
cannabis user this is because it can
take 30 to 120 minutes for any
noticeable effects to occur furthermore
cannabis edibles tend to cause a
stronger and longer lasting hive in
smoking while the effects of smoke
cannabis lasts about one to three hours
the effects of eating cannabis can last
about 6 to 10 hours according to Mitch
Earlywine a professor of psychology at
the State University of New York at
Albany eaten cannabis gets metabolized
by the liver so Delta 9 THC becomes 11
hydroxy THC which passes the blood-brain
barrier more rapidly and has more of a
psychedelic effect than standard THC
smoked or vaporized cannabis bypasses
the liver and doesn't create the same 11
hydroxy THC Pulitzer prize-winning New
York Times columnist Maureen Dowd got
really high she was doing some research
in Denver after Colorado's legalization
of marijuana and Dowd had a really bad
trip like super bat dad wrote it all up
in a recent column I felt a scary
shudder go through my body and brain I
barely made it from the desks of the bed
Reilly crawled up in a hallucinatory
state for the next eight hours I was
thirsty but couldn't move to get water
or even turn on the lights
I was panting and paranoid sure but when
the room service waiter knocked and I
didn't answer
he called the police and had me arrested
for being unable to handle my candy Oh
Maureen of course she did that thing
that nobody smart ever would do is eat
the whole bar for crying out if you
actually read the labels on bars and may
have labels now which they didn't in the
black market for pods you might expect
Dowd has gotten a lot of response
including from this guy Matt Brown
described as one of Maureen Dowd's
primary marijuana industry contacts in
Denver Brown is the co-founder of my 420
tours
featuring the Colorado Summer mountain
cannabis tour he showed out around town
as the burning question did you like
warned maureen dowd of how potent those
pot edibles can be the answer according
to the cannabis is yeah man yeah she got
the warning Brown said she did what all
the reporters did she listened she
bought some samples I don't remember
what exactly me and the owner of the
distance area and the assistant manager
and the budtender talked with her for 45
minutes at the shop the article even
implies doubt could have avoided the
whole Superbad trip if he had just
rolled a joint instead quote she got
some bud some edibles and when we got
back to the hotel she had to run off to
a Mitt Romney documentary screening she
asked me will you roll a joint for me I
don't know how to do it but she had to
run really quickly to the screening and
I was going to catch a flight the next
day and we were gonna connect a few
nights later but it never worked out but
regardless of how uncomfortable and
edible cannabis high it may be for a
newbie unlike those who consume too much
alcohol or prescription painkillers
according to Paul R Montano deputy
director of normal they're not going to
suffer any long-term potential harm
toxicity or lethal overdose it's not as
if people are going to the hospital and
having their stomachs pumped after using
cannabis he says we shouldn't base you
know one person's bad trip or or use of
drugs badly if you had eight servings of
you know vodka and light weight and
wrote about it it would be pretty ugly
shots of patron if I did I wouldn't be
here right now IV vomiting in Camille's
bucket
in the ER I would just trip alone in
your hotel room in the dark she did so
many things wrong here and the other
thing she did wrong that I really I hold
her accountable for this is she took a
little bit and didn't wait long enough
and it didn't work so she took some more
and then ate the whole candy bar and she
gets a gold medal that's what you do
when you're 19 or in her case 75 it's
worth highlighting that the incentives
for the people who are selling these
edibles are pretty clear they don't want
to make you sick and want you to have a
pleasurable experience when you buy
their products you'll come back and get
more I suspect that if these products
didn't have the label she said she
wasn't warned at the store although she
did learn about it the next day
that's bedroom she did not vet the
product she did not do her variations
and I'm kind of ashamed she bench ate
Nick Gillespie Akali good reason has a
good point about this that this is all
actually part of the market discovery
process here in fact that's that's norm
but so happens we're going to get rid of
prohibition start legalizing things
people are going to engage in kinds of
trials and error and it's it's actually
helpful to have people write about it
and explain it I mean you know if
someone reads this and realizes that
they shouldn't eat an entire candy bar
full of pot that's not the worst thing
in the world the worst thing in the
world in my mind is that they read that
and come to the inaccurate conclusion
that having that thing legally available
is worse than having a black market when
all kinds of worse things are available
so when cannabis is consumed what
happens to your body to put it simply
the cannabinoids travel through your
bloodstream to your brain where the THC
fits into receptors that are part of the
brains natural endocannabinoid system
this system helps control an array of
functions like emotions memory paint
sensitivity and appetite
humans and many animals normally produce
their own endocannabinoids that fit into
these receptors so by imitating their
activity THC can dramatically alter the
same functions THC also increases
dopamine and other neurotransmitter
activity in the brain dopamine is
released naturally in response to food
sex and other enjoyable things
Cannabis affects everyone differently
and highs can vary greatly depending on
tolerance dosage method of consumption
strain used state of mind and
environment it's also important to keep
in mind that while cannabis may all
three users in profound ways the effects
are temporary commonly short-term
cannabis effects include euphoria
relaxation altered perception feelings
of well-being an increased appreciation
for music and other arts introspection
dry mouth and increased senses appetite
creativity and libido memory disruptions
a warped sense of time and paranoia are
also possible short-term effects
especially for infrequent cannabis users
according to a 2012 study THC can also
increase heart rate however the sample
size was a mere 16 male subjects which
is too small to reach an accurate
conclusions when you first smoke that is
you know you light up a joint the spliff
of blunts receptors which are throughout
the brain respond and these areas of the
brain are responsible for things like
pleasure memory learning sensation a
sense of time and space
coordination movement appetite and other
drives shall we say so it's sort of an
all-over impact right so reward pleasure
hunger you have this this overall
feeling of well-being they say that all
sounds pretty good other scientific
studies have been done on the acute
effects of cannabis like studies about
the long-term effects of weed potential
harm is the focus of most of these
studies for example a 2013 study found
that all cannabis doses caused time over
and under estimation in novice users
conversely the researchers concluded
heavy users do not experience these
negative temporal effects furthermore
infrequent cannabis users often
experience disruptions in memory and
spatial navigation
a result of the high number of
cannabinoid receptors in the hippocampus
and prefrontal cortex of the brain
columbia university neuroscientist carl
heart research subjects in his lab smoke
marijuana and then take a variety of
cognitive tests the effects will be
disruption
in memory disruptions in inhibitory
control they will become slower at
cognitive functioning a wide range of
things these effects are temporary but
they're pretty pronounced and they're
clear and it's slowly becoming clear to
scientists what part of the brain is
most affected
it's the prefrontal cortex it's very
important for planning thinking
coordinating your behaviors
there are tons of marijuana receptors in
this region and we think that marijuana
particularly in the novice can disrupt
all of those behaviors an impairment
that Hart cautions could be dangerous
especially when driving look at this
experiment done by CNN affiliate ki ro
in Washington State subjects smoked
marijuana
and then drove one was a daily medical
marijuana smoker and another an
infrequent weekend smoker relaxed
buzz the more the novice user smoked the
more trouble behind the wheel watch
yourself watch yourself but
interestingly the habitual smoker didn't
have as much trouble and that's
something I witnessed firsthand driving
around with 19 year old Chaz Moore the
day that I spent with him he had been
smoking all day long do you feel
impaired at all no I don't normal it
turns out when you test people who have
a lot of experience with cannabis you
don't see many disruptions but if you
test people who have sort of a limited
history with cannabis you can see some
clear pronounced disruptions
additionally two separate studies by
researchers at the University of Western
Ontario and Vanderbilt University
suggest that cannabis may trigger or
mute anxiety and fear in users via
cannabinoid receptors in the amygdala
you can get paranoid you can have
disorganized thinking you get
disoriented it can be uncomfortable into
panic attacks another common result of
cannabis use is increased appetite or
the munchies which is effective in
treating nausea and appetite loss
once again this effect is caused by
cannabinoid receptors in the brain more
specifically in the hypothalamus which
regulates appetite in 2014 researchers
in France concluded that THC causes
users to smell and taste more intensely
while mimicking the sensation of
starvation in their brains
additionally researchers who published a
study in 2012 found that dopamine
created from THC acts on cannabinoid
receptors in a part of the brain called
the nucleus accumbens increasing the
pleasure of eating while high another
positive phenomenon often associated
with cannabis use is increased
creativity though the evidence is
largely anecdotal
there's this phenomenon reported by many
smokers over the years especially famous
artists the ability to be more creative
when you feel that high there's sort of
a release of dopamine and your brain
sort of has the ability now to perceive
things slightly differently from the way
you might have if you hadn't been
smoking pot what you really see is this
reduction in hit Vettori function a 2001
study found that using cannabis cause no
increasing creativity while a 2012 study
by scientists in the UK found the
opposite painter Amir a successful
artist his canvases sell for up to
twenty five thousand dollars
[Music]
it's my favorite way to work he's been
painting for 14 years smoking for even
longer he says it makes him feel more
relaxed but most importantly for him he
says it makes him less critical of his
own work stop worrying so much about
this and that and just sort of looking
and being as as present as possible once
again cannabis is effects vary depending
on many factors and novice users should
pay careful attention to dosage
especially when eating cannabis smoking
or vaporizing weed is a better method of
consumption for a first timer it's also
important to remember that any
unpleasant effects from too much
cannabis are temporary

home of the water shrew.
This tiny rodent, one of the
smallest mammals on our planet,
forages around the banks of streams
constantly in search of food.
It has a heartbeat rate of 300 per minute,
therefore, everything it does
seems to us to happen
at a very rapid pace.
It's springtime, the mating season.
The scent of a nearby female

In fact, she's pretty close by.
But he's not alone.
Another male has exactly

the sultanate of oman is a country
characterized by breathtaking landscapes
and a thriving culture
this small nation occupies the south
eastern coast of the arabian peninsula
where the persian gulf meets the arabian
sea
oman has used its oil wealth to
modernise whilst honoring its age-old
traditions and thanks to the late sultan
caboose oman has transformed from what
was once a largely underdeveloped
provincial backwater into a modern and
prosperous society
[Music]
nowhere is this more evident than in its
radiant capital muscats
[Music]
a great symbol of sultan caboose's
legacy who sadly passed away in 2020 is
the grand mosque in muscat
the mosque which took six years to build
was a present from sultan caboose to the
people of oman
it's absolutely beautiful here it's a
really really grand mosque and it holds
around 25 000 worshipers and it's made
of around 300 000 tons of indian
sandstone so you can get a sense of how
big this place is
[Music]
religion is at the heart of oman and
omanis mainly practice a moderate branch
of islam called ibidism
the faith underpins many of oman's
values such as tolerance and
open-mindedness which are reflected in
the incredible hospitality of the omani
people
[Music]
the men's prayer room is just as
beautiful as the outside of the mosque
everything from the hand-woven persian
carpet to the crystal studded chandelier
is a symbol of opulence
the mirhab stands tall at the front of
the prayer room signaling the direction
of prayer towards mecca and is adorned
with golden tiled mosaics
some people may be surprised to hear
that the sultan never had any of his own
children but he would often say that
there was no need to because for him the
people of oman were his children
[Music]
matra is a port town in the capital of
moscat and like most port cities it has
a rich history of commerce and trade
i met up with yasser a local omani to
learn more about oman's history and how
it still influences much of the culture
today
we are now in matasuk the one of the old
suga in the middle east
and especially here in oman
and this look here when you enter inside
you just dismiss the frankincense before
the discovery of oil frankincense was
oman's most lucrative trade
the smoldering resin comes from the
boswellia sakura tree and oman is one of
the only places in the world to grow
these
the francis is coming from
the south of uh oman
that's where you find the frankincense
trees that's true
and this is type of the frankincense
with the different
price with the different types
we have like the number ones which is
more
white green see this one
the best quality see the colors that's
like a kind of green white white green
and you can eat it like a chin gum see
you can try
it's me like
it is good for the teeth
and it's good for stomach it tastes like
it's not meat
so when you walk around you can really
smell the frankincense most of the shops
are burning it smells absolutely
incredible
[Music]
the soup sells lots of traditional omani
products and one that i wanted to learn
more about was the kanja knife
the kanja used for hundreds of years as
a weapon is now a defining symbol of
oman
you can see them everywhere around oman
and even on the omani notes
normally wearing this like in the
wedding okay if we meet some
special guest
like we have like a festival or
something
one of the oldest shops in the souk
alibaba also has an incredible
collection of kanjas the owner akhtar
belushi showed me one that was worn by a
member of the royal family and is made
of rhino tusk and gold
it's amazing to see how proud omanis are
of their heritage
[Music]
at the end of mantra harbour is muscat's
lively fish market which is a primary
place locals come to buy their fresh
fish and there is an incredible variety
on offer
the three good quality in oman one they
call king fish kingfish and tuna
and jamun
yeah this is the three famous best
quality effect quality fish
and how do you cook it with spices and
things or how do you cook it like a
traditional tuna you can cook in
different way okay like a curry like
with a sauce like a barbecue
[Music]
fishing has traditionally been the main
source of income for many omanis and to
this day it continues to provide a
living for fishermen in oman's villages
and coastal cities
without the stingray i never actually
thought that you could eat
stingray i never thought that that was
something people could eat in oman we
eat it the test is very good
very
if you try it you want to eat it every
time
[Music]
i'm here at the cornish of muscat which
is a beautiful promenade along the gulf
of oman and it's such a beautiful place
to come and wander along and you can see
a lot of the locals coming out and all
gathering together it's a beautiful
place to come at sunset
you can hear the call to prayer from the
local mosque signaling the final prayer
of the day it's very atmospheric and you
feel like you're truly in the heart of
arabia
[Music]
traditional wooden dow boats which were
historically used for trading can still
be seen on the gulf of oman and are a
powerful reminder of oman's once mighty
empire which stretched along the east
coast of africa and up to pakistan
[Music]
nowadays dow boats are used for tourism
and a sunset boat trip is a perfect way
to see muscat's historic coastline
[Music]
oman fell victim to foreign invaders due
to its prime position on trade routes to
south east asia
in 1507 the portuguese succeeded in
invading and conquering the coastal
region in muscat
they controlled the region for more than
a hundred years before being driven out
by omani forces
the only remaining symbol of the
portuguese occupation are two forts
standing above the city a reminder of
oman's once turbulent past
[Music]
the view of the cornish from the boat is
so beautiful you have the matcha sook
and the mosque and then you've got these
beautiful mountains behind and at this
time as well when the sun's setting
everything just looks so
incredible
[Music]
muscat is a mystical city which is rich
in culture and history i felt like i got
a true taste of authentic arabia

[Music]
around the world 3 300 used tires are
produced every minute
this is a huge problem for the
environment one which every country
deals with differently
the emission norms
are maybe stricter in europe worldwide
the industry is looking for solutions to
reuse old tires
but what exactly does this look like
under what conditions do companies
recycle our old tires and who profits
from this
our mission today what happens to used
tires
to find out we start our research trip
in kuwait city
because here in the middle of the
arabian desert we can find the biggest
tire dump in the world
on an area of more than one square
kilometer the kuwaitis collect used
for months we've been asking for filming
permission we're only allowed access
under one condition
the landfill commissioner of the
government saba faye accompanies us
come from the
shop for a change like tire at kuwait
collected here
there is
six or seven million in this area
for
safety
then make a recycle for the time
[Music]
yes one damn big
danger
because
not go after maybe 500 years
or more yeah yeah put in undertale
the problem is not unknown but what are
the q80 people doing about it we haven't
seen anyone working on the landfill let
alone recycling
[Music]
now my planning
i am from municipality of kuwait
my job quality is
tired after
there is
a plant for the department to make a
plant
for a metal recycle now chose the area
to make this plant
nothing really happens here and hasn't
for years the country hasn't recycled a
single tire itself but then why do they
collect them
in business but
for the
environment
when dinner only
kd
he won't tell us from whom and why
after the first three questions the
interview is declared closed
under the pretext of wanting to take
some more pictures of tyres we're
allowed to film alone on the premises
and then we discover a few people who
are actually working
obviously something is happening here
some pakistani and indian immigrants are
sorting tires by size
but we're also being watched
the manager of a private company has
discovered us
we politely ask for an interview and he
actually agrees
a few months ago he bought a million
tires for a lot of money but even this
company doesn't recycle them itself we
are dealing directly with the factories
there so
some of the factories they are using
them to make crumb rubber yeah
and some factories they are extracting
the fuel today
apparently somebody does make money with
the old tires after all
the workers shred the tires into tiny
pieces and send them all over the world
in containers
but one thing is clear to us in kuwait
they have not yet found their own
solution when it comes to recycling huge
mountains of old tyres this is not the
way to be
this is a waste they shouldn't sell it
they should think about it not
commercially but environmentally
this is what this is our point of view
this is a disaster
and if they are thinking about it
commercially
okay this is this will cost more
problems
however he also earns his money with the
old tires his company is currently the
only one actively involved in the
dismantling of the landfill
it'll probably take years to recycle all
the tyres from the world's largest tyre
mountain
nothing is happening here yet and that's
why we're traveling to the world market
leader in scrap tire recycling
this mission takes us to vyborg in
denmark
the company has developed its own
process to recycle scrap tires almost
completely a closely guarded secret
plant manager lars rajholger is
nevertheless willing to give us an
insight
hello hello welcome
thank you very much nice to meet you
the dane's secret about used tires is
indeed strictly guarded
it's like fort knox yeah that's right
please come in
lars rawhauger leads us into the
delivery area first
about 25 000 tires arrive here every day
mostly from denmark scandinavia and
england
it's definitely not waste tires are made
of the very best materials the very best
rubber steel and textile
and it's a big big waste
not to recycle the tyres and produce new
raw materials
only the best materials go into tyres
after all they have to withstand extreme
conditions on the road but that's
exactly what makes them so difficult to
recycle
but the company has invented a unique
method to do just that so it's not
possible to show me the whole process no
absolutely not we are very careful about
that
only a very very few people are admitted
to our time
the rubber is cooled down
using like liquid nitrogen
minus 190 degrees celsius
and because of this soap becomes very
cold
it's more easy to crush into the very
very fine powder
what comes out of the machine in the end
is equivalent to new rubber
so old tires are turned into the basic
material for new ones
we have a good grip about tile recycling
in europe but
in the third world
this is a really big problem also
because that we
in the rich world are exporting used
tires to the third world
because they still have a little bit of
rubber left so we have in we have
enjoyed the tire for most of the
lifetime but the poor country get the
waste problem which
i believe is not quite ethical
once the tires leave europe nobody can
check what happens to them
we research and find a tire recycler in
india who claims to be the largest
recycler in the country using
state-of-the-art technology and he's
based in mumbai
the biggest city in a country that isn't
exactly known for being a pioneer in
environmental protection
we are curious about what to expect
because the company allegedly produces
fuel from scrap tires in the form of
diesel
drive to an industrial area just outside
mumbai
on the company premises we meet vishesh
agava the boss of the
[Music]
company we get a material mostly from
europe and different countries sell us
different kind of material so this
material let's say comes in from italy
and belgium
and we have different other type of
material like full tires coming in which
comes in from germany
and these tires then go through the
full processing
to produce diesel from used tires the
company heats them in a reactor this
process is called pyrolysis
tyre rubber consists of 65 petroleum a
valuable raw material that the company
wants to recover
to prevent the tyres inside the reactor
from sticking a worker throws magnesium
against the wall
we know this from climbing for example
and it's not dangerous
however the salt that's produced when it
melts is dangerous
and it's in the air constantly it
contains a lot of carbon
the world health organization therefore
classifies it as potentially
carcinogenic
after loading the process is finally
supposed to start
the machine is defective and we have to
be patient
it can happen after all the company is
currently setting up several new
machines
but while we're filming the repair work
we unintentionally record the following
conversation via the boss's microphone
normal i don't think they have so much
into problem about this dirtiness and
all right they're not filming that it's
not about their problems it's about our
plan being looking clean in the video
that's it
how does it care they are not pollution
control people that they're gonna have
reason enough to take a closer look
around
and this whole thing here doesn't have
much to do with environmental awareness
and it gets worse
only 50 meters from the machines we
discover this hut
apparently people live here
in the middle of the factory site and in
the middle of the dirt
[Music]
do you think do you think it's it's
healthy for them to live here next to
this oil things
uh
they don't live here they live on the
outside
okay they
water for the construction
but they're in this houses they live
there right
in those houses yeah no though that's
temporary accommodation only for the
construction phase okay the construction
workers and then they'll be shifted to
the houses
aha temporary accommodation
the idea to recover the oil from old
tyres is actually a good one
but the implementation here in india is
poor
above all
we wonder what impact this process has
on people
and the environment
[Music]
you can see the the reactor is running
now and there is no pollution
because there is good equipment for
treating the pollution but there is
something coming out what is it hot air
like like when you burn the natural gas
what comes out after burning natural gas
the same emissions are from the
the pyrolysis plants it's completely
pollution air pollution free
that's not quite true
we've spoken to experts from germany who
confirmed that this plant is a somewhat
outdated model where even sulfur can end
up in the air
dangerous for people and the environment
nevertheless in india it's allowed
[Music]
the the emission norms
are maybe stricter in europe and as a as
a collective
you know there's a collective decision
that they will not allow pyrolysis
to prove to us that the old tyres really
have become fueled the boss pours it
into his motorbike
melting down used tires to obtain fuel
has not yet become established in europe
however experts are researching this
technology and trying to develop the
process further
but how is the problem of used tyres
dealt with in germany
we travel to borg lengenfeld near
reagan's border where we visit one of
the oldest and largest cement plants in
germany
but what does cement have to do with our
used tires
[Music]
daniel schmidt is technical manager at
the plant
cement burning is an energy intensive
process that requires extreme heat
[Music]
the factory goes through about 30 tons
of rubber per day
the rubber in the used tyres has the
same calorific value as coal i.e one
tonne of tyres is equivalent to one
tonne of coal approximately this helps
us save our primary fuel
to burn cement the company normally
fires the kilns with coal and plastic
waste
the used tires can save up to 10 percent
of the coal
the tyres then burn together with
limestone in the rotary kiln
this produces cement which we use for
example when building houses
the advantage is that the steel from the
tyres melts with the cement and makes it
stronger
is there anything left over from the
tyre
[Music]
the flame temperature is 2 000 degrees
and the material has about 1450 when it
gets here so there's no rubber or metal
left of the tires
so the tyres serve as fuel and for
hardening the cement the only problem is
that cement works cause about three
times as much pollution as all air
traffic that's why only factories with
professional pollution control are
allowed to burn tyres
nevertheless rubber is a precious
material which can be used to make so
much more
the conclusion of our mission recycling
used tires is a problem worldwide
simply burning the valuable materials
may not be the worst solution however
the best solution for our scrap tyres is
currently being provided by the danes
with their approach to recycling

when you collect bottles it always looks
like you're out begging or like you're
poorer than
poor it's hard work but Herbert couldn't
get by without the deposit bottles he
collects he scour hamburg's Reaper bar
entertainment strip at night Herbert
worked hard all his life but hasn't
enough to live on many German retirees
take low-paying part-time jobs or like
care but collect
bottles 25 cents I wouldn't have seen it
I
would
you get knife for them 2:30 a.m. on
hamburg's Reaper bar people are out till
the wee hours in The Nightlife
[Music]
district nothing in there her's looking
for deposit bottles he can get a few
cents back at the store what'll that one
get you8 cents
it's not much but still it adds up at
first it was hard to collect bottles
other people had
used but I'm all right with it
now I've pretty much got used to
it now it's no big
deal for other people it's just trash
right yeah that's right but 10 bottles
is 80 cents get a coffee for
that he's 65 years old and Herbert isn't
his real name he'd rather we didn't say
it collecting bottles is no fun for him
it means picking through garbage and
poking around corners he'd rather not
poke around but he can make a lot of
money when the weather's nice or after
festivals in 4 days over
€200
going out every
night you can do it for 4 days and
before you know it you've got quite a
bit and you have to transport them
somehow it's a bit easier with a
car
Herber can barely afford it but he can't
do without his old car he uses it to
store the bottles at night when the
super markets are
closed how much so
far not
spectacular it's
limited Herber has to watch every scent
but he doesn't fret over it anymore he
does get annoyed when millions are spent
on Prestige
buildings that's just not right and for
just the little glass with a few holes
in the
side oh well hamburg's got the
cash he means the El filon hamburg's new
and rather expensive concert hall now
one of the city's Prime landmarks and a
symbol of German
Prosperity yeah oh oh 220 your money for
this
month that's the rest for this month I
get my next payment on Friday and I'll
spread it out so I can make ends
meat nothing in the
bank
no maybe 65 cents
left not worth thinking
about but I'll get some more on
Friday and I can get by till
Friday he used to go out to sea on big
trips to America Asia and Australia he
trained as a welder at hamburg's Famous
Blom and F
Shipyard it was a good job and well paid
as a trainee you didn't get very much
but you were working and learning and
that was worth
something what did you imagine your old
age would be
like I didn't I wasn't even thinking
about old age at that time now Herbert
lives in a small flat in Hamburg Styles
hope quarter a social Hotpot poverty has
become a serious problem for Germany's
elderly about 1 million more senior
citizens are close to Poverty now than
10 years a go her has to wait
outside strict
rules a weekly trip to the food bank
helped Herbert get
by that's a vegan dish no
vegan then I've got a nice soup here no
no
thanks thank
you no no thanks I don't eat
vegan people in need can take as many
groceries as they require for just €2
it's mostly donated by
supermarkets more and more older people
are turning up
here often they're reluctant they've
learned not to sponge off the state we
hear that again and again as the reason
older people don't take advantage of the
food
bank your first visit
like I was quite
shy I was scared to be honest
why I felt like I was
begging but now I've got used to it it's
about
dignity yes you get used to it now I've
got used to
it could you give me one of those
what what is
that yeah that's yeah that's
fine Herber worked all his life he has a
cheap apartment at the edge of town but
still can't make ends meet on his
pension come here just
look he won't do anything W you come out
couch I know you're lying under the
couch you're sorry come on out here his
pension comes to around €900 a month
nearly half of it goes on
rent do you ever think you won't make
it
sometimes you can start to Despair and
think oh to hell with it all but then I
always tell myself no there are always
those who are worse off than I
am and there really are
Herbert is separated from his wife his
daughter can't help him out she's
struggling with poverty
herself what I'd like to do is travel to
Sydney
Australia I think the city is so
fascinating just that oddl looking opera
house
there it's been there for many many
decades
already that would be the city and the
country I'd like to see one more
time but I couldn't afford
that it's way beyond my financial means
in every
way but that's my
wish Herber was born in this building in
central
Hamburg you went in
here this was the
entrance his father died young but his
mother always had enough to get by even
in her later years Herbert sees the
current situation is
unfair what kind of pension can the
young people expect who are in their 20s
and finishing their studying today just
think about it hardly anything at
all Saturday morning just before 5:
Herbert is on the
streets I think it's gorgeous here by
the harbor I really like
it his pension is in his account but
Herbert has to keep collecting bottles
the cost of living in Hamburg his
beloved Hometown is
high without Hamburg I could hardly live
I was born here and then to move
elsewhere no not a
chance if it's cheaper
not even then I need this
city bottle collectors work alone they
rarely encounter one another and rarely
as peacefully as on this
occasion this one this one this one one
South African Sailors are still out from
the night
before isn't hambur beautiful it's very
beautiful very beautiful yeah yeah yeah
yeah I like hurg h work is very
beautiful we've been out for a night
it's really beautiful and uh like
uhg is Riv R yeah Riv yeah yeah we came
from
R but when two bottle collectors meet
they often prefer not to exchange
words does make you tired yeah yes
it does really wear you out the dragging
and
walking but there's another up there I
want to grab
it he's on his feet all night for just a
few
Euros I'd say I make seven or eight
Euros at
most and that's how I
live actually I get by fairly well I
can't complain though collecting bottles
is pretty hard work but we have to do it
I can't change
that
and

[Music]
this
is the
f-35b lightning
it's known as a fifth generation
multi-role aircraft with stealth
capability
but with a top speed of 1200 miles an
hour an operational ceiling of 50 000
feet
and the ability to land vertically onto
the deck of an aircraft carrier
to put it more simply this is the most
sophisticated fighter jet the world has
ever seen
[Music]
you can't go past that line
that's hundred million quids with a kit
they don't want us near it we can't get
closer than this no 100 million pounds
how much is that two million quid yeah
chicken feed what speeds yours top end
250 yeah that's about 1200 miles per
hour that one i thought you're supposed
to be a fan of the car you're on the
side of the car you present the car show
i'm just i'm refereeing i'm i'm you know
i'm standing off from both of them
doesn't sound like it to me it sounds
like you're in the corner of the plane
to me
in the game of top trumps with that jet
in this car at the minute this car's not
doing that well but i've got everything
around the track right are we ready for
this gooseman
paddy come on we agreed no
top gun dork call me i'm maverick i'm no
known as maverick why you maverick
maverick's the cool one
so now that we've met the competition
next the referee wanted to go over the
rules of the race
gentlemen pretty straightforward this
we're going to make our way down this
straight here through the orange markers
all the way down there gonna do a left
then you're gonna do a left down here
another left
along the straight to the finishing line
first across the finish line wins any
questions
yeah the
the jet can't quite exactly do that so
what i'm going to do is i'm going to be
at 250 feet 400 miles an hour at this
turn we'll put the bank on it'll be a
limiter pull to get to 35 alpha to
minimize the radius of the turn to then
parallel the disused runway we'll roll
out level i'll continue down there'll be
another left turn again 7g 400 miles an
hour limiter pull round the corner to
roll out we'll continue up i'm not going
to make this turn left here it's too
tight i'm going to continue off again
250 feet this time at 500 miles an hour
to enter this turn 7g sustained to then
bleed down 35 alpha so you can see the
jets skidding around the corner to then
roll wings level 100 foot 550 mile an
hour finish
with the car down here
[Laughter]
hang on a second
who's that
the pilot
looks about 18.
they start them young now all right okay
all okay yeah
all right let's turn and burn lads do
you know what that is coffee cup correct
let's get out of here let's do it wings
up
[Music]
with the engineers now pouring over
every detail of their machines before
the race
suffice to say both teams were taking
things seriously
and with final checks complete
it was time
to take to the track
[Music]
that's fairly intimidating
[Music]
wow
what a piece of kit
f35 versus speed tail it's the coolest
thing i've ever done
look at the thing it just looks like an
engine with a person strapped to the
front of it
christopher are you
ready as i'll ever be
here we go then
ready steady go
i'm off
[Music]
where's the jets
[Music]
come on mr mclaren come on mr mcmahon
i'm on the car
okay here we go last corner
oh oh he's ahead
wayne's going to do the big loop peter
this is where we'll get our time
where is he where is he
i can see the f-35
got it
got it
[Music]
that is one of the coolest pieces of
engineering i've ever seen if i'm going
to lose to anyone
i'm going to lose to that

(somber music)
- [Narrator] It was theirs.
By virtue of fee simple,
the Osage tribe
owned clear title
to their entire reservation.
The Osage, unlike other tribes,
bought their home
in Indian territory,
and moved to what would become
Osage County in Oklahoma.
They hoped their new home
would have nothing the
white man would ever want.
The land was owned
collectively by the Osage,
an idea foreign to whites,
whose attitude was,
"Those savage Indians
should divide the land."
Each tribal member
would be worth
more than 10 times the
average American citizen.
But the Osage saw more value
in a place all Osages
could call home.
But discovery of black
gold changed everything.
Oil was discovered in the 1890s,
but the real boom didn't start
until the 1910s and '20s.
The Osage Allotment Act of 1906
forced the tribe to
divide their land,
with each Osage citizen
receiving an equal share.
The mineral rights,
everything under the ground,
would remain held in
common by the Osage.
The royalties paid
to extract minerals
was divided among
2,229 headrights,
one headright for
each enrolled Osage.
The Osage enrollment was closed
and there would only
be 2,229 headrights.
- You have to remember that
the oil and gas reserve
helped fuel the fires of World
War I in the United States.
And they paid
royalties for this,
for the privilege of
extracting this oil and gas.
And this royalty was
paid to the Osages.
And so these people
supposedly became
the richest people in
the world per capita.
(lively saloon music)
- [Narrator] Not surprisingly,
the Osages enjoyed their money.
New cars,
building fine homes,
decorated in the latest style,
and traveling to
exotic locations.
The Osage became the
envy of the world.
Major publications of the era
printed articles on
those rich Indians,
the richest people in the world.
The public perception
generated by the publicity
fueled the fires of
racism and greed.
- What they're doing is
they're making fun of the Osage
and the use of their money.
They're also saying,
"Look, they don't deserve
it, and they're wasting it."
And that's the two
messages that come across.
This is going against
the Puritan work ethic,
you work hard and make money.
Here are people who
are not doing anything
and they have
unbelievable wealth.
And so you're creating
kind of this atmosphere,
or this idea that
somehow or another,
taking money from the
Osage is not wrong.
- It was just a reign of terror.
That's what they called it.
There was no other
way to describe it.
If you were an Osage
and you had money
and you're a full-blood,
you might as well have
been walking around
with a target on you.
Everybody in the world
descended into this area
to try to find
every possible way
to separate the Osage
from their money.
- [Narrator] No one in
government at the time
believed Indians of any tribe
could manage their own affairs.
Because of this racist belief,
the Federal Indian Service
would hold in trust
the assets of individual
Indians, including the Osage.
Guardians were appointed,
and had complete control over
individual Indian assets.
- I think there might've been
a very nice little cottage
industry of certain people,
lawyers, who were
guardians of people,
and when I say
people, more than one.
They were guardian of
more than one person.
And they'd charge a nice
little fee to do this.
And they probably...
I don't know whether
they got wealthy or not,
but they certainly didn't hurt
their bottom line any at all.
- [Narrator] Many
guardians with Osage wards
took advantage of their position
to separate the Osage
from their money.
- Many of the whites
who live in Osage County
attempt to exploit the Osage.
It permeates all
levels of Osage.
There are bootleggers.
There are prostitutes.
There are gamblers.
There are burglars.
There are rustlers.
There are armed robbers.
They go, and all of these
people victimize the Osage.
But they're not the only ones.
The merchants create a
two-tier pricing level,
charing the Osage more
than they're charging
non-Osage customers.
Remember, it's not racist.
It's Osage.
- His name was Wakon Iron.
He was my grandfather's brother,
and therefore he
was my grandfather
and he treated me
like a grandson.
And the money was loaned
to an entrepreneur
from his account at
the Osage Agency.
Today we call it IIM account,
Individual Indian Money account.
And his money was just loaned
to the local entrepreneur
and they built the hotel.
And then he, at some point,
was paid 10% of
what was owed him.
They did that through a...
What did they call
it? Bankruptcy.
A bankruptcy hearing where
he wasn't well-represented.
He didn't know about it
until after the whole thing
was over and done with.
And then the guy
that built the hotel
then sold the hotel to
his brother for the 10%,
equal to 10%.
And then, through a
circle of transactions,
it came back to the
original scam artist
who ended up owning the hotel.
And it was kind
of a funny story.
One time, my grandfather,
he told me he wanted
to show me something,
so he drove me downtown in
Pawhuska, in front of the hotel,
and he stopped out in
the middle of the street.
And he had arthritis,
so he could drive well, but
he had trouble pointing.
But he pointed up to
this window and he said,
"You see that window up
there at the third floor
and the second window
over," something like that.
And I said yeah, and he
said, "Well, in the end,
that man who scammed
me out of the money,"
he didn't use the word
"scam," but he said the man
that did him out of the
money committed suicide.
He took the big jump from
that third-floor window
and landed on the
sidewalk below.
And then he said,
"But I'm still here,"
and so he felt that...
And he was a very
philosophical man.
He was a very good man.
To him, there was
no trade-off there.
He simply got the
better of the deal.
He lost some money in it,
but he had a much better life
than that man who
was a scam artist.
(bell tolls)
- [Narrator] One
all-too-common scheme
was to marry an Osage
headright holder.
Upon an untimely death,
the spouse would inherit
unimaginable riches.
- Okay, about my grandfather.
He died at an early
age. He died, he was 29.
Supposedly he died
of poisoned whiskey.
He came home one evening,
laid down on the couch,
and never woke up.
Supposedly, people
told me years later,
and this is probably
second-hand information,
that he was drinking,
or had some drinks
with some other people.
One of those people
was Kelsie Morrison.
But it seemed to me that
nobody else in that crowd,
maybe it was just Kelsie
Morrison by himself,
nobody else in that
crowd I ever heard of
ever got sick from
drinking that whiskey.
But Kelsie Morrison
was a bootlegger.
He was a known bootlegger. He
was a convicted bootlegger.
There's a case called United
States versus Morrison.
He's convicted of
bootlegging whiskey
on the old Pawhuska Road.
Purpose was for him to benefit,
with my grandfather's death,
of him either getting
some headright money,
or my granddad's
wife, Tillie Powell,
getting the headright money
and Kelsie would
benefit from it.
Because on Tillie's
tombstone, it says:
"Tillie Powell, wife
of Kelsie Morrison."
- The Osages at that time knew
somebody was killing them off
but they didn't know who it was.
They tell me they would
leave their lights on.
They'd put lights
around their yards
and they would try to get dogs,
and some people hired
guards and things like this
because they were really scared.
And with good reason.
- [Narrator] Local
law enforcement
was of no use to the Osage.
The sheriff allegedly ran
a brothel out of his jail.
The Osage tribal council
knew they had to do something
and hired the newly
formed FBI to investigate.
The FBI determined a
local banker, Bill Hale,
and his nephews were
responsible for many deaths.
But to convict Hale,
they focused on only one
of his murder schemes.
- Hale was not a smart criminal.
He was simply brutal.
And given the
way that society was up
there during those days,
he didn't have to be.
He didn't have to
cover his tracks,
or he didn't have to,
you know, take any precautions.
Because who was gonna catch him?
Who was going to
testify against him?
- They called it
the Reign of Terror,
because you didn't know where
it was gonna strike next.
You don't know whose house
was gonna be blown up next.
You didn't know who was
gonna be killed next.
You didn't know who
was gonna be shot next.
No.
No. They didn't have to
kill us for the money.
If they'd have hung
around long enough,
we'd have given it to 'em.
We do that today.
- [Narrator] The current
generation of Osage
feels that the money
was the least important
of their losses.
The knowledge of
traditions and ceremonies
could not be passed down
as it had for centuries.
The deaths of so many loved ones
created a hole in the
cosmos of Osage culture,
a hole that can never be filled.
- But I think every Osage knows
all these stories that I know.
And all the families
have stories,
all of the families
have tragedies,
and all the families
have account
of being taken advantage of.
It's just a part
of our history now,
and hopefully we're
making progress
of not being victims any longer.
We hope that over
a period of time,
we become a strong a group
of people as we ever were.

this is the world we live in if we
weren't surrounded by it every day if we
didn't take it for granted
we'd be dumbstruck by its very intricacy
and brilliance
this is an ordinary familiar wooden
pencil you might think a pencil is
simple chances are you've been using one
since before you could even read or
write but just because it's familiar
doesn't mean it's simple in fact it's
complicated elaborate beautiful elegant
it's very existence is too improbable
for any one person to truly comprehend
these are the basic materials that go
into a pencil graphite cedar metal and
rubber but if you had all the elements
of a pencil right in front of you could
you make a pencil it's not as easy as
you might think in fact no single person
on the face of the earth could do it
without the help of countless others and
this is the key to understanding the
world
a pencil just like you and me is the end
result of a vast and intricate family
tree a symphony of human activity that
spans the globe through their work and
knowledge a vast number of people have
had a hand in making this simple pencil
unlike your family tree this one begins
with an actual tree
the most immediate ancestor of the
pencil is a cedar tree in the Pacific
Northwest but the loggers who harvest
the timber are also its ancestors and
these men don't work alone they in turn
are assisted by the people and
industries that produce the saws rope
countless other tools that they use
these are also the ancestors of our
pencil as is the waitress at a nearby
diner who sells the loggers lunch to say
nothing for thousands of people involved
in producing that simple midday meal
across time and space the web grows
consider the roads trucks ships
communication systems and the people who
design build and maintain them all of
them are necessary to bring the lumber
to the mills and the slat factories to
process them all of them were also the
ancestors of the pencil and even with
the work of all these people so far all
we have is a stained wooden slat a naked
half of a wooden body of a pencil but
it's family tree is larger and more
extensive
the graphite is mined in China and Sri
Lanka at the pencil Factory is mixed
with clay and heat and other materials
before it's extruded dried and baked in
a kiln people from different contents
different cultures cooperate to bring
these materials together with waxes and
kilns and equipment from across the
world these two are the ancestors of the
pencil and the same is true of the
eraser with ingredients from around the
world it's the end result of a similarly
complex and exotic branch the family
tree as is the ferrule the metal band
made from material that is mined refined
and shipped from all over the world each
part of the pencil is the results of the
collaboration and cooperation of
millions of people together they form a
process that is constantly changing and
adapting a change in the availability or
cost of material from one place might
make another source more desirable and
the process changes and adapts fluidly
and there is a fact that's still more
astounding the absence of a mastermind
of anyone dictating these countless
actions which bring a pencil in being
each member of this family tree supplies
only a small amount of the necessary
know-how needed to make a pencil they do
so voluntarily not because they
necessarily want pencils or like pencils
but because by working to create them
they exchange their labor and skills for
the wages let them buy with a
what you're seeing is the market at work
the spontaneous configuration of
creative human energies of millions of
people with their various skills and
talents organizing voluntarily in
response to human necessity and desire
as if led by an invisible hand to
promote an end which was no part of the
intention every second we are live we
benefit from the products of voluntary
spontaneous cooperation this is the
modern world it's miraculous its
intricate and it gets better every day
so long as people are free to interact
with each other if we can leave the
creative energies of humankind
uninhibited there's no limit what we can
accomplish
and

the world's most trafficked mammal is
one you may have never even heard of
the pangolin
despite its lizard-like appearance the
pangolin
is indeed a mammal
some pangolins are as small as a house
cat
while others are as big as a
medium-sized dog
pangolins are covered in as many as 1
000 scales which protect them from
predators like big cats
when threatened a pangolin's natural
defense is to curl up into a ball
unfortunately there's one predator that
pangolins aren't able to protect
themselves against
humans
according to some estimates poachers
have hunted more than one million
pangolins in the past decade
poachers use trafficking routes that
span the globe frequently shifting
routes to evade law enforcement
all eight pangolin species found only in
tropical asia and sub-saharan africa are
now at risk of extinction
pangolins are killed for a variety of
uses from medicine to luxury goods with
the greatest demand in china and vietnam
pangolin scales often powdered or made
into a paste are prescribed in
traditional medicine for everything from
relieving arthritis to stimulating
lactation
[Music]
however these remedies have no
scientific basis
[Music]
in fact pangolin scales are made of
keratin
the same material found in fingernails
pangolin fetuses sometimes consumed in
soup are erroneously thought to enhance
a man's virility
but only the wealthy can afford to eat
pangolin which is consumed in parts of
asia to demonstrate social status
in 2016
cities the international treaty on
wildlife trade voted to ban all
commercial trade in pangolins
however these creatures continue to be
poached at an alarming rate even causing
a devastating crash in asian pangolin
populations
recently poachers have increasingly
turned to african species
the largest confiscation of pangolin
scales occurred in 2017
which according to one estimate came
from about 20 000 african pangolins
making prospects worse for pangolin
conservation pangolins face habitat loss
plus they reproduce slowly giving birth
to only one baby a year
but why should we care about an animal
most people have never heard of
pangolin dealers are often part of the
same worldwide criminal networks that
drive other animals such as elephants
and rhinos toward extinction
plus loss of pangolins could prove to be
an ecological and economic disaster for
local communities
pangolins eat termites that might
otherwise destroy crops and buildings
pangolins also suffer abuses in the
wildlife trade such as force-feeding and
injuries from snares
a few lucky pangolins survive being
trafficked
confiscated pangolins in vietnam for
example may be sent to a rescue center
and returned to the wild
there's a lot of work to be done to
ensure the survival of pangolins
countries must work to reduce demand and
enforce laws against poaching
otherwise these gentle creatures may
disappear before most people even know
they exist

developed into one of the world's
foremost advocates for children gaining
access to education as well as for
children's rights on the whole this was
the catalyst that transform Malala
yousufzai into a global Crusader and
two-time Nobel Peace Prize nominee who
was to create a strong impression during
her visit to Trinidad and Tobago over
the course of six days international
media attention was focused on this twin
island nation as this courageous
seventeen-year-old would meet children
from across a wide section of society I
took the opportunity to invite her to
see what we are doing and so that she
may inspire us all leaders educators
students and young people to not just
continue the good work to not just
pursue our dreams but like her to never
give up
a major role in the subsequent
proceedings was played by the university
of trinidad and tobago an institution
that is actively sought to develop the
entrepreneurial spirit and proactive
ethic that will lead to the continuous
creation of local businesses jobs and
wealth generation that will enhance the
standard of living within trinidad and
tobago we are always reminded of the
fact that there are those amongst us who
face particular talents enlight these
citizens were certainly not forgotten
during malala's visit to the lady ho
Choi ho Minh Gasparilla the summit of
malala's visit to Trinidad and Tobago
may well have been the rally for local
school students that took place at the
National Academy for the Performing Arts
in Port of Spain you are really lucky
that you have P education and I think
this is this is a great opportunity for
you to focus more on your education and
to continue it because we should not
forget that there are 57 million
or out of school and who really needs
support to what you have got you should
be thankful for it and you should focus
on it seeing here today on here and I
speak you know you really get the
perspective of where we came from on how
blessed we are in Toronto for having
such free education actually right up
until the tissue level this have some
Elysium ages I am as just like wow and
she's doing so many things and it drives
me to do even more
so I really appreciate city and I'm
honored to be here and not for today
yesterday I met amazing person whom I
could not imagine that I would meet ever
in my life I met Brian Lara
I learned some very good things from him
even though he was saying it to my
brother but I picked it out and he was
saying that when you start learning you
learn it step by step if I think that I
want to change the world in two seconds
it can't really be done if you look at
the reality so we have to do things step
by step Ilana's visit to the
emancipation village at the grandstand
of the Queen's Park Savannah was an
appropriate nod to the rewards of
universal liberation among the
highlights of malala's visit were the
opportunities of meeting the Acting
President of the Republic of Trinidad
and Tobago His Excellency Timothy Hamill
Smith as well as the Prime Minister of
the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago the
Honorable Kamla posad possessor the
final public engagement of the six-day
experience is an evening with Malala the
National Academy for the Performing Arts
I'm going to give something and I'm
going to take something there are two
reasons I'm going to give something to
this country which is to share my story
to tell children here how important it
is for them to continue their education
to focus on it to make their country
proud in the second one is to take
something nothing which I take is an
example an example to tell the world
that this is a country here education is
free from primary level to secondary and
then to tertiary and children are even
supported in the university level so
this is an example toward it is an
example to every country that they
should learn from this country where
education is free and where every child
has access to school - thank you so much
as it celebrates the 10th anniversary of
its establishment the university of
trinidad and tobago is riding the crest
of a wave of constant expansion utt is
involved not only in education but in
engineering and entrepreneurship in
agriculture and maritime studies
we are soon to launch an aviation
institute and Institute of Finance in
conjunction with the international
financial center Penner and Tobago
studies in video animation and fashion
and many more areas the university of
trinidad and tobago is very honored to
have played an important role in
malala's historic visit the university
of trinidad and tobago would like to
thank all the sponsors who made this
visit possible

you know looking back arthur might not
be the wholesome pbs kids cartoon that
we all thought it was
i mean he had an episode where everyone
in school struggled with addiction to
strange ingredients in the candy bars
that they were eaten that's
certainly concerning and the whole world
seems to operate under unspoken societal
prejudices and hierarchies i mean did
your six-year-old self ever notice the
fact that reptile characters are only
ever shown to be doing jobs with heavy
manual labor it's true it's almost
enough to make you ball up your fist in
anger but there's one other dark truth
about this show
that you might have missed back in
preschool heck that the adults
watching this with their kids have still
missed to this day a dark truth that'll
make your brain
melt and that my friends is what we're
covering today
[Music]
hello internet welcome to film theory
the show that has an original point of
view
just like everyone that you meet when
you're walking down the street here's a
question for you what's the longest
running american cartoon
if you said the simpsons well you
probably also watched our king of the
hill episode and you're right
congratulations but you know what the
second
longest running cartoon in america is
it's our buddy arthur the aardvark who's
been growing up while learning
family-friendly lessons on
tv screens since 1996. this would be the
part where i say
only 90s kids will remember but after 22
seasons
arthur is still on the air it's wild
that my son can grow up watching the
same shows that were on tv when i was a
kid
and i'm glad that arthur never left
cause every kid ought to grow up in a
world where we can learn to work
and play and get along with each other
arthur's also one of those shows that's
great to go back to as an adult cause a
lot of the jokes were totally put in
there for the parents who had to watch
whatever their kids were watching and if
you were a kid well you probably missed
a lot of those references the first time
around
sorry sue ellen it's a brother and
sister race maybe there's a contest for
lonely children after this
it's only children dw a lonely child is
what you're gonna be when i sell you
holy jeez arthur when you sell
your sister what am i gonna do run away
literally join the circus my mom knows a
good plastic surgeon but there's another
thing that you might have missed when
watching arthur as a kid
something that's not so bright and
cheery it may be a wonderful kind of day
but we wouldn't be film theory if we
weren't willing to ruin those wholesome
childhood memories by exposing the dark
and tragic truths behind them now if
you're somehow one of the people who
didn't grow up watching this pbs classic
as a kid arthur is a show about an
aardvark named arthur and his sister dw
as they go to school with their friends
including a rabbit named buster a monkey
named francine a bulldog named binky a
bear named the brain
everyone in the world is an animal in
case you missed the pattern
and um that's pretty much what you need
to know in typical kids show fashion
they learn life lessons
they shade each other you know how polly
lock it works that's where you keep your
most special important thing
i figured you'd want to put this in
there no thanks
i'm gonna put in a picture of my cat oh
and they burn the spelling of aardvark
into your brain so completely that
literal decades after you watch that one
episode
you still hear it in your mind
a-a-r-d-v-a-r-k
a-a-r-d-b-a-r-k
no joke it is still how i remember how
to spell that word even as i'm typing
this up that song
is playing constantly in the back of my
brain and that's what you get if you're
the target demographic but if you've
ever stumbled across an episode of this
show as someone a bit older
after learning about the birds and the
bees you might be wondering
how in a society of animals inner
species romance works but ha
jokes on you the show is already one
step ahead of you despite arthur living
in a society with many different types
of animals
most families seem to be single species
arthur and his sister dw are both
aardvarks and both of their parents are
also aardvarks buster baxter is a rabbit
with two rabbit parents
francine is a monkey with two monkey
parents and so on and so
forth now we do know that inner species
romance isn't exactly taboo for instance
back in 2019
mr ratburn who you might have already
guessed is a rat
married and aardvark and while that
episode was apparently controversial
enough to get it banned from television
in
alabama i'm gonna wager that the outrage
was more about the fact that mr ratburn
was a man marrying another man
and not so much the fact that it was a
rat marrying an aardvark
in this world there's apparently nothing
saying that an aardvark can't date
or marry a rat but when it comes to
biology and reproduction
the arthur universe seems to follow
rules pretty similar to our own
if you're an aardvark looking to make
some aardvark babies you're gonna have
to find yourself another aardvark or at
least
that's the way it seems at first until
you start digging deeper
and you notice a strange trend for
instance molly and james mcdonald
they're both rabbits
and while their father is a rabbit their
mom is a dog
emily here is also a rabbit with a
rabbit mother and a monkey
father and carl is a rabbit who has an
aardvark mother and no other parents
that we can see
at first these three examples might seem
to disprove the idea that interspecies
romance in the arthur universe can't
result in reproduction but there's
another thing that they all have in
common molly
james emily and carl the four characters
who all have at least one parent that
doesn't match their own species are all
rabbits that doesn't seem like it can be
a coincidence in a world full of
aardvarks monkeys bulldogs and all other
kinds of animal species it
just so happens that the kids who have
parents of different species
all are predominantly rabbits when you
see a pattern like that it's the kind of
thing that raises questions
and demands answers the first question i
had is whether there might be some
particular quirk of rabbit biology that
might allow him to breed across species
it's not unheard of for there to be
genetic hybrids after all for instance
you may have heard of mules
well they're the offspring of a horse
and a donkey there's also many varieties
of zebroids which result in
cross-breeding zebras with other species
you know what you get when you cross a
zebra in a horse
a zorse what do you get when you cross a
zebra in a donkey a zonkey and those
aren't jokes those are actual real
animals that can be created
via crossbreeding we assumed that molly
james emily and carl were all rabbits
based on their distinctive rabbit-like
features but could it be that they're
the result of some kind of crossbreeding
well the science
doesn't seem to support it rabbits
aren't genetically similar enough to
dogs monkeys or
aardvarks to crossbreed with them you
could argue that the arthur universe has
different rules here after all all the
animals are genetically similar enough
to walk
upright on two feet and speak to each
other in english but even if that were
the case it still doesn't explain why
it's only
rabbits that we see as the children in
these inner species relationships
however there may indeed be a biological
explanation for why it's always
rabbits who seem to be raised by
non-rabbit parents and it gets into some
territory that has some pretty troubling
implications for the wider
arthur universe one thing that we've
been doing this whole time is operating
under the assumption that
all of these rabbit kids are the
biological children of the parents that
they live with but as we all know the
real world is full of plenty of examples
where parents and children
aren't related by blood obviously
adoption exists and there are plenty of
kids with divorced parents living with
their
step parents in short the way i see it
there are two key possibilities
potentially causing this trend
one divorce is more common in rabbit
couples or two
rabbit children are getting put up for
adoption more frequently so let's start
with possibility one divorce being
common in rabbit couples you see this
theory already seems plausible
considering that divorce
exists in arthur's world buster baxter
has parents who are separated
also a rabbit couple and there's a real
world explanation for this you see real
world rabbits don't tend to mate with
only one partner for their entire
lifetime
they're not monogamous you could say
that they are hopping from partner to
partner which you know could produce
some strain on a relationship when bitsy
baxter over there is finding her husband
beau in the borough with another woman
except there's a problem with all this
rabbits aren't alone in this category
very very few animal species are
actually monogamous
it's mostly because it doesn't make
sense from a genetic standpoint
reproduction is all about ensuring the
survival of your genes into the next
generation
so you want as many chances at that as
possible with a relatively wide array of
mates monogamy is costly because it
requires an individual to place their
entire reproductive investment on the
fitness
of their one mate it's putting all their
eggs in one basket
literally and in arthur we see all
different animal types from aardvarks to
bulldogs
goats monkeys moose pigs sheep in all i
counted about 20 different species of
animal shown to be functioning members
of this society and the fact is
most of these types of animals would be
dealing with the same marital issues if
monogamy was really a concern in this
universe
so it doesn't seem like divorce here is
causing the issue
which means it has to roll up to option
two adoption
but why would so many bunny babies be
put up for adoption in this universe
well i think it's actually the result of
two contributing factors you see it's no
secret that rabbits are notorious for
their mating abilities the phrase
breeding like rabbits is a thing that
exists for a good reason
rabbits are able to become pregnant
early in life with some species able to
get the ball rolling so to speak
as early as four months of age add to
that the fact that the female is able to
get pregnant for all but
three days per month and you've got
yourself a wide open window for babies
now that alone would be pretty unique in
the animal kingdom but there's another
few factors that make
rabbits incredible breeders you see a
mother rabbit usually gives birth within
32 days of getting pregnant and is ready
to get pregnant again
almost immediately after giving birth so
if they wanted
a mother rabbit could have a litter of
babies almost every month
nearly 12 in a year which is incredible
compare that to humans where the
gestational period is 266 days but what
makes
rabbit breeding truly insane is that
each of those litters can have anywhere
between 1
and 14 babies with the average being
six compare that to other animals that
we see in the arthur universe aardvarks
one baby every seven months
monkeys one baby every two years or so
dogs cats foxes bears you name it all of
them have longer pregnancies and smaller
litters
which means that there's going to be a
lot more rabbits in this world than
there are
any other type of animal and this is
something that's actually confirmed by
the show's character list
looking through lists of all characters
to have ever appeared in arthur you
quickly see that there are nearly
220 unique rabbit characters that have
shown up on the screen
the second most animal species is as
you'd expect aardvarks which clock in at
around 170 unique characters but that
number is also inflated since our main
character is himself in aardvark so the
show is going to revolve around him and
his animal type
no other animal even comes close to
touching the number of rabbit characters
in this show
now it'd be tempting to say that all
these newborn bunnies are resulting in
the parents abandoning some of their
kids which is terrible
and awful and quite honestly would make
a pretty darn good dark twist for this
episode on a show made for elementary
school kids but i don't think that's the
case here there isn't any scientific
evidence suggesting that rabbit parents
are any more negligent than parents of
other species and it also won't explain
why there are so many
one rabbit households now i think that
there's something else at play here you
see
there is one basic bit of biology that
separates rabbits from pretty much every
other species that we see on the show
lifespan let's go back to that character
frequency chart shall we and compare the
life spans of the most common species
that we see in the arthur universe
aardvarks 18 years in the wild
23 in captivity brown bear 20 to 25
years in the wild
dogs 10 to 15 years depending on the
breed indoor cats 13 to 17 years brown
spider monkeys 27 years in the wild 33
in captivity
rabbit one to two years in the wild five
to seven
in captivity to borrow from another kids
program one of these
things is not like the others in the
world of arthur animal lifespans are
probably going to be closer to what they
would be in captivity since arthur and
his classmates probably don't have to
worry about things like natural
predators of course i missed that
episode where the brain has to learn to
suppress his bear-like instincts to
avoid devouring his classmates but even
when raised in captivity
rabbits have a much shorter life span
than aardvarks monkeys
dogs and pretty much every other species
that we see up here in arthur with the
only big exception being rats but then
again
this is a third grade rat in arthur dude
already looks like he's ready to put a
mortgage on a house so i'd say he's
agent pretty darn
fast now obviously everything that we
see in the arthur universe isn't going
to be one to one with real life these
animals can stand upright on two legs to
walk down the street and can learn to
work and play and get along with each
other these animals seem to age at a
rate similar to humans while real-life
rabbits are capable of breeding at ages
as young as four to six months buster is
eight years old and doesn't seem to have
hit puberty yet so if we adjust animal
life spans to human lifespans like we
see on the show it would look a little
something like this
aardvarks 97 years brown bear 95 years
dogs 42 to 63 years depending on the
breed cats
63 years monkeys 139 years
rabbits 24 to 42 and this my friends
explains the thing that sent us down
this rabbit hole in the first place
which is why there are so many rabbits
who seem to have guardians of other
species or just live in single rabbit
families the simple fact is that even if
rabbits are starting families at ages as
young as
18 a significant portion of them won't
live long enough to see their kids
finish school with rabbit lifespan so
short it's no wonder that so many rabbit
kids are being raised by non-rabbits the
surviving rabbit parent probably
remarries out of desire to have a
partner to raise kids with
them if this is common in the arthur
universe it wouldn't be all that weird
for this sort of thing to happen which
would explain why it's never commented
on by characters in the show
arthur has been on the air since 1996
and he's just one of those cartoon
characters that doesn't age he's been an
eight-year-old third grader for over 23
years which
gotta say it's probably a good thing if
the series actually followed the
characters for 23 years they might have
already gotten to the point where
buster's classmates have to hold his
funeral
while everyone else is in the prime of
their lives that of course would be
after the episode where buster goes
through his midlife crisis somewhere in
the middle of high school
looking at all the life expectancies for
the animals in the arthur universe
arthur the aardvark actually has a
pretty decent shot of outliving most of
his other classmates maybe
he really should marry francine the
monkey if he's looking for someone to
spend his golden years with oh wait he
actually does this is something that is
confirmed in the show
they do wind up together and strangely
have a conversation about buster
there's buster baxter whatever happened
to him
huh whatever happened to buster strange
how those best friends don't wind up
together in the end and notice how
arthur just doesn't respond in this
moment he just
stares sadly off into the distance it's
almost like he had a dear old friend who
died a bit too early
and that my friends is my feel good
episode on the world of arthur happy
childhoods and remember
it's all just a theory a film theory

what happens next may take your breath
away and hopefully get you thinking
the magnitude of that moment did not
escape the nation's view
six-year-old ruby bridges and four
federal marshals
we've been sent by the president of the
united states and we are here to escort
you to school today
the governor of the state decided that i
will not
force my people to integrate against
their will
going through this kind of living hell
what would you expect
crowds of protesters lined to the
streets
teachers at the school refused to
instruct her governor
george wallace who blocked by literally
standing in the door
200 people waiting at 8 30 in the
morning to tell her they were going to
kill her
then they had a machine gun beside their
guns they threatened to poison ruby
president of the united states and
troops you are one of my heroes
i'm here because of you the governor
called the national guard all because of
just one little girl
he pulled his gun to shoot things were
gonna get really worse
i can't believe this kind of stuff
happens i would like to know what's
happening to her
until now she has never told the full
story of what happened to her
when they knocked on the door my parents
opened the door and i remember standing
there and seeing these
four very tall white men
i remember them saying that we're
federal marshals
we've been sent by the president of the
united states
and we are here to escort you and your
daughter to school today
i found myself in the car driving
this very short drive to this new school
and the minute we turned the corner
i saw what i thought was mighty girl
there were so many people standing out
in the middle of the street
and they were screaming and shouting and
throwing things
i draw the line in the dust and i say
segregation
now segregation tomorrow and segregation
forever
the car door opened and those federal
marshals they grabbed my hand
and i remember them saying ruby walk
straight ahead and don't look back
one of the city policemen he pulled his
gun to shoot
and everybody say they knew private to
kill me and says if they killed the
mother
the child wouldn't have went 200 people
waiting at 8 30 in the morning to tell
her they were going to kill
200 people in the afternoon telling you
they're going to kill her
the crowd would come and they would
bring a small
baby's coffin and they put this
black doll inside of the coffin and they
would march around
the school and i would have to pass it
to get inside of the building
and i used to have nightmares about the
coffin this is a people's movement
it doesn't make any difference whether
the major politicians are going to
support you or not
if they don't support us in this
movement to take
back our government and give it to us
and let us run our own institutions
those who stand in the way are liable to
get run over
when i got inside of the building i
remember it being very
quiet i received a call from the
superintendent's office
and asking me if i would like to take a
first grade position
that morning when i arrived of course
the anger
and the hostility was palpable i was
told
that if i went downstairs i would meet
my student
so i walked down to a cavernous basement
area of the school
those doors instantly opened and amidst
this
towering presence of federal marshals
stood the most beautiful little girl
one could ever dream of seeing looking
so
delicate so unaware of the mantle for
change she wore that day
and as i went over toward her to
introduce myself
she came forward and i think she felt
she was pretty special and she was
and she looked that way she beautiful
pink dress party dress
and as i walked over to meet her her
bowed head sort of raised gently
and a little smile came across her face
and then those beautiful big brown eyes
that she still has rose to nepal
and you know it was a case of love at
first sight
how could you not fall in love with a
child like that in a moment like that
and so leaving behind a cameo of the
past
ruby and i held our hands left them
walked together upstairs to our first
grade classroom
and began our solitary adventure i
remember looking at her
and thinking she's white
i've never seen a white teacher before
she looked exactly like the people
outside
she wasn't by the next day the crowds
had doubled
they kept pointing at me and shouting
kept saying we're gonna poison her we're
gonna hang her
i remember hearing my mom said that she
would send me the school
and that every day she would sit and
pray
all day to three o'clock until i walked
back through the door
and the federal marshals they met with
my parents and they said you should
prepare her lunch and she should eat it
at her desk
they actually thought that i was afraid
of being poisoned and i remember them
coming to me
and saying why were you not eating
and why did you lie and i said
because i want to eat lunch in the
cafeteria with the other kids
the minute we got to the cafeteria and
they pushed open the doors
nothing but empty tables there were no
kids
and i remember being so disappointed
about that
i just knew they were in the cafeteria
i would go into this coat closet to hang
up my coat and every time i went into
the closet
i would hear kids voices
and i would mention it to my teacher and
she wouldn't say anything
and there were days when i would go back
into the closet and i would just stand
there
just to see if i really heard them and i
did
you see there were white parents who
tried to send their kids to school with
me
those white parents had to cross the
same picket line that i did
and they were never protected by federal
marshals as they crossed the picket line
the principal would take the kids and
she would hide them
so they would never see me and i would
never see them
i went up to the principal and i said
why are they not with ruby
and she said well that teacher won't
teach her
and i said well i will teach them and so
shortly thereafter they would come and
join us for the afternoon
and i do remember that beginning where
those three or four little kids just
gingerly walked
into that room because that was the
first time they had ever been
in a classroom with a black child i went
in to sit down
to play with them but that is the day
because a little boy looked at me and he
said i can't play with you
my mom said not to play with you because
you're
and the minute he said that i remember
to this very day
it felt as if this weight lifted off my
shoulders
all of a sudden by him saying that i
knew
why there were no kids there
and the truth is even though he hurt my
feelings
i was never angry with him
because in my mind i thought he was
explaining to me
why he couldn't play with me he said
my mom said not to play with you
and i thought to myself if my mom
had said ruby don't play with him
he's asian don't play with him
he's indian he's hispanic he's white
if my mom had said not to play with him
i would not have played with him
so i wasn't angry with him i understood
one cannot underestimate the courage of
ruby
and the power a child has i believe it
was in the best interest of white and
black
uh to be in a segregated school system
but i was wrong
our children need to know that white
folks
black folks they stood together
thank god for the teacher that was there
she was my best friend
and she taught me the lesson that dr
king tried to teach
each and every one of us and that is we
should never judge a person by the color
of their skin
[Applause]
i always say that she showed me her
heart we had a grand time together i
think side by side than just the two of
us
i believe that if we are going to get
past our racial differences
it's going to come from our kids but we
as adults have to allow them
opportunities to come together i think
it's important for kids to dream
and be able to believe that they can
follow those dreams
i don't think i would be here today if i
wasn't dreaming

thank Google look here guys
[Music]
actually I'm not sure if I should
explore this maybe when I'm more
prepared though it doesn't look like it
eats anywhere no maybe this is a good
place to the third base looks really
cool here I actually might do that
[Music]
there we go look how cute this this
dissing has read big head okay but we
got distracted
let's maybe climb that tree over here
okay that's fire right there
take holy crap
that's more
okay Gold I should have been able to see
this from my base look you can even see
the pyramid
I'll keep this block Japan doesn't seem
to be anything directly under the block
oh look at this
we actually found something not just a
matter of getting down water if this is
just a regular cake system
[Music]
so let's head back to the gate I'm going
to replace the gold books with this one
let's remember displayed guys in case we
have the one guns back
ok show what gold box should I replace
the one with dad or just a random one
Oh
CREB
[Music]
I did not put this here
ah you can empty fine Oh unleash
[Music]
Unleashed to unleash means to cause a
strong or violent force to be released
or become unrestrained
let's see I think the base should be on
this flat area right here just food back
because I don't want to lose it

[Music]
big the Philip I'm taking it I don't
care
no no that's some work here
but

I'm 12 years old, in the seventh grade
My dream is to become an artist with charisma,
great vocal skills,
and be recognized worldwide
Because
whether you see it as a new direction, the fact that all the members are Japanese,
it doesn't matter how you classify us,
because I do believe we are paving a new path in this industry
I want to be with the members who have helped me grow and taught me so much
and who I can overcome anything with
I want to be with them from now and forever
X-GALAXY is a project to 
train and debut artists
who can be recognized 
not only in Japan but also in Korea, Asia, and the world.
You can't easily explain how the girls will rise to the top, but they have limitless potential
Because they're not gonna stop
I'm confident that we have the world's best team and the best system for training them
If we fail, I'll take all the responsibility
Don't be afraid
rather, just enjoy it all
Our bond is stronger than family
at X-GALAXY,
it's not only about the bond between the trainees who share a similar vision of debuting,
it includes all the staff members who have put their careers and lives on the line to see this through...
is extraordinary.
Now's not the time to be laughing
You guys are spending too much time sitting around
You don't have time to watch, grasp, and understand
You guys won't achieve anything if you don't stay proactive
Do that after you debut! You guys aren't on that level!
You're nowhere near that level!
You're just overthinking it, CHISA
Don't lose heart. Don't give up!
We will become the most amazing artists - more than anyone else
and become a team that we're proud of
The most important thing is our ambition to become stars
We are serious. We will definitely create stars
XGALX is a new label that 
has spent 5-6 years preparing and creating 
a new global artist girl group
We are independently carrying out 
the discovery, development, planning, management, and production of XG
Our intention from the beginning was to promote the girls in South Korea
on various music programs and shows
The sole reason being that Korea has the leading system when it comes to "idol culture"
It's not just another musical genre - it's a culture that has been developed by pioneers
who have fought fiercely and put in ther blood, sweat, and tears
As someone who has been involved in the KPOP scene for over 10 years
I have a great sense of pride.
As players in this industry
I believe that we have the opportunity to learn, grow and show a lot of people what we're made of
With our amazing music, content, and astonishing performances
as well as the loveable personalities of all the members and their well-respected charisma
we carry the vision of consistent growth
for all of the members and the overall group
We honestly struggled quite a bit with the question
 'Is XG KPOP or JPOP?'
While all of our artists are Japanese
and even though we promote and produce content in Korea,
we express our message on a global scale
by singing and performing our songs in English
With all the members of our international staff at XGALX
and with the desire to pave a new path 
for our girls and our vision
-through our music-
we've always asked..."Should we define and confine ourselves within a single category?"
It's still an ongoing thought...
In the beginning, new challenges are 
often perceived as uncomfortable for many
and that it'll probably be a bumpy ride...
but it's something we expected and were prepared for
More than anything, we wanted to show how serious we were
through our level of music and performance,
we hope to show as many people as possible, a new form of entertainment
This...
I think is possible
So we, as an all-Japanese group known as XG,
came to Korea to learn
and to challenge ourselves, and prepared ourselves
with the hopes and ambition of being recognized
As the person in charge,
I'm aware
that there are countless opinions
Anyway, the most important thing is...
Instead of defining what is and isn't KPOP
As those who are a part of the culture
It's our job to have them accept and enjoy our presence
as outliers and newcomers 
to the KPOP scene
I believe those are the next steps 
How we progress in the future
is how we will get everyone to understand how serious we are
I hope we can become a company that can take part in
further advancing the idol culture industry and market
I think it's something that's very meaningful
As the person responsible for leading XGALX, the representative, and as a producer
I wanted to be able to personally explain
our vision, direction, and identity
I hope you all have high hopes for the members of XG,
who have put in so much hard work and passion as they prepared for their debut
[2012 Idol Star Olympics Championships]
[Gold Medai DALMATIAN SIMON]
Many people may not know this, but
[My mother is Japanese]
my father is Korean and my mother is Japanese
[Given that it's the the Olympics, I would like to send hope to multicultural families]
[I didn't come in first through my skills alone]
I grew up spending a lot of time in Korea
and I also spent time in Japan, immersed in Japanese culture
so this is something that I believe to be my destiny
I wanted this all-Japanese group
to be accepted by Koreans
and to reach KPOP fans
I wanted to show how an unprecedented grop
can evolve
with a strong will and courage
And this documentary, "XTRA XTRA",
is full of our raw story, how we created and evolved
so I think watching this can help people understand
on a deeper level of who we are
Incidentally, the name "XTRA XTRA"
harkens back to the era where everyone got their information from newspapers
and in the US, when an impactful headline was out,
people would shout, "extra, extra!"
as they handed out newspapers
The passion that these girls have to become global artists
Their commitment and path leading up to their debut
was very harsh, and was at times warm
and other times held together by their strong and unshakable bond
so please watch the drama behind all of those events unfold
I'd like for all of you to watch this documentary. It'll definitely surprise you
I think it was the perfect name for this documentary
and given our team name is Xtraordinary Girls,
the fact that we ended up calling this documentary "XTRA XTRA" was probably also fate
so please look forward to it
XGALX, XG - we're now just taking our first steps
For those who may be wondering what Xpop is,
please watch this documentary
Hopefully our activities from here on out will be a good answer to that question
and I hope to show everyone how we consistently grow
Thank you, that's all from me, SIMON
HESONO O! 

19:15 and italy has just joined the
first world war it sided with the on Tom
powers despite previously having made a
defensive pact with the Central Powers
because it was austria-hungary that
invaded Serbia in 1914 that meant that
it wasn't a defensive war and thus Italy
could sit it out both sides had tried to
convince Italy to join them and it was
the aunt on who won out in the end when
Italy signed the Treaty of London which
promised them all of this territory from
austria-hungary as well as a mountain of
cash or made the 23rd Italy declared war
on the austro-hungarian Empire and Italy
was all in Italy didn't exactly perform
very well during the war but fortunately
their main opponent was austria-hungary
who also didn't perform very well in
late 1917 came Italy's greatest defeat
during the war the Battle of Caporetto
this saw the Central Powers pushed this
far into Italy thus threatening Venice
and also seeing 300,000 Italian
casualties in order to raise morale the
Liberal government promised soldiers
loads of things like the vote and free
land anyway austro-hungarian successes
in the war just like in everything else
didn't last in November 1918 the Battle
of Vittorio Veneto began which saw the
collapse of the austro-hungarian army in
the end of the war in the Italian front
a week after this victory the first
world war was over and Italy was free to
celebrate and gain the lands the Allies
had promised them or at least they'd
hoped during the Paris Peace Conference
the Italians demanded what they had been
promised plus a little bit more the ally
said no and instead gave these Ares to
Italy in the rest of the promised
territories to the new kingdom of
Yugoslavia many Italians felt that this
was a gross betrayal by the rest of the
on tante and this became known as the
Vittorio mutilator
the mutilated victory the displeasure at
the post-war settlement came to a head
when Gabriele D'Annunzio led a group of
armed Italian nationalists of the city
of the umay and occupied it they wanted
Italy to annex it but the government
refused as such it was declared to be a
free state but after the Italian Navy
blockaded the city D'Annunzio
surrendered to make matters worse the
post-war economy was in ruins and since
all of the soldiers had been demobilized
and many of the wartime factories were
closed unemployment skyrocketed
also the promise of land to the soldiers
wasn't honored but they did get the vote
all of this disappointment surrounding
the outcome of the war combined with the
economic downturn meant that people
became much more extreme in their
demands this led to what's known as the
red biennium which saw two years of
increased support for socialist parties
greater industrial action some of which
was quite violent and even calls for a
revolution like that in Russia these
more radical socialists were quite
frightening to
many Italians and to prevent them from
gaining power some turn to a new group
the fascists led by a certain Benito
Mussolini Mussolini had previously
himself been a socialist but he was
kicked out of the party when he
supported Italian entry into World War
one after the war many unemployed
veterans during the Blackshirts a
fascist militia went up and down the
country making life pretty miserable for
any and all socialist they could find
Mussolini wasn't in complete control of
the Blackshirts though regional leaders
like at a low bow bow had immense sway
but did largely accept Mussolini's
leadership the current prime minister of
Italy at this point was a man could
Giovanni G alit II who was a
conservative and disliked the growing
power of the Socialists but also was
concerned about the fascists he decided
to call a new election to Italy's
Parliament the House of Deputies where
he would form a broad coalition which
would include Mussolini and his fascists
the idea was that given Mussolini a
legitimate position in government would
make him act in a more respectable
manner and kill off the fascist movement
the idea was a bad one G le T actually
lost seats during this election and the
Socialists gained them sort of some of
the seats were gained by the newly
formed Communist Party created by a
certain Antonio Gramsci as a result
passing legislation was much more
difficult and the fascists now had
friends in high places in late 1921 the
fascists decided to become a formal
political party the national fascist
party the pmf Mussolini wanted to enter
government via peaceful means but the
party's members wanted him to take power
now on October the 28th 1922 the
fascists conducted their infamous march
on Rome where by tens of thousands of
Blackshirts marched on Rome
Mussolini wasn't there himself though he
was in Milan ready to flee to
Switzerland if it all went wrong Victor
Emmanuel the 3rd was asked to sign an
order allowing the army to open fire and
the black shares the king for reasons
unknown did not and the next day he made
Mussolini the Prime Minister so the
proportional representation system used
in Italian elections meant the no party
ever won a majority Mussolini along with
many others sought to change this than a
man could Giacomo a turbo put forward a
law known as the ature Bo law which
meant that the winning party in any
future elections would get a clear
majority of seats this law was supported
by most parties for two reasons the
first was that everyone hated the
current electoral system since he made
weak government's the second and
arguably main reason they supported the
law was the armed black shirts who were
in the room with them another election
was held in 1924 with Mussolini and the
fascist party standing for the first
time at the head of a right-wing
listen they won about 65% of the vote
and there's a lot of debate as to how
clean the elections were there were
certainly violence against Mussolini's
opponents but he was also very popular
many Italians were hoping he would fix
the country's problems the head of the
Socialist Opposition Giacomo Matteotti
spoke out against Mussolini's victory
saying it was tainted by the violence
inflicted by his followers
shortly after this Matt ERT was
kidnapped and murdered by fascist black
chairs the murder of Maserati forced
many of Mussolini's coalition partners
to abandon him he looked like his grip
on power was slipping the fascist
membership wanted Mussolini to be more
extreme and hostile to his coalition
partners whereas Mussolini didn't want
to lose more support in the Chamber of
Deputies which was becoming more and
more difficult since he was directly
implicated Amati of his murder as such
she took a major risk On January the 3rd
1925 Mussolini walked into the Chamber
of Deputies and dared anyone to remove
him nobody did this is seen as the end
of liberal Italy in the beginnings of
fascist Italy but the difference wasn't
immediate and in many ways there was
little difference at all conservatives
and liberals were still being appointed
to positions of authority that said
Mussolini did become a dictator in late
1925 he went from being the Prime
Minister of Italy to being the head of
the government although he's better
known by his other title in Luce the
leader the next year after a few
assassination attempts he banned all
opposition parties had Gramsci arrested
and enacted strict press censorship the
new regime began a phase propaganda
campaign and sought to present Mussolini
as an unassailable leader in the same
vein as the old Roman emperors
Mussolini's first goal was to fix
Italy's ailing economy he sought to
increase the levels of industrialization
across Italy which were far behind the
other great powers
Mussolini also sought to win several
economic battles to secure Italy's
position as a leading nation the two
most important being the battle for
grain in the battle for the lira the
battle for grain was designed to make
Italy self-sufficient in grain
production the battle for the lira was
meant to make the lira more valuable as
an international currency which would
make importing certain resources of
which Italy lacked more feasible
Mussolini also made an agreement with
pope pius xi to settle the roman
question the pope didn't recognize
italian sovereignty over him and
mussolini cut him a deal we'll give you
some money you'll stop openly
criticizing fascism and the vatican will
gain its independence they agreed and in
1929 the Vatican City became the world's
smallest independent country furthermore
Mussolini's government encouraged people
to take up sports and also urge women to
have more children all of the
aforementioned
mangez largely didn't work a make life
worse for many Italians but it was seen
as their duty to endure for the sake of
Italy their endurance would ideally see
Italy recapture its old glory from the
days of the Roman Empire Mussolini had
promised the Italian people that he
would rebuild the Roman Empire for them
which is why he had ambitions on all of
these countries to the north lay ostry
who everyone knew that Germany under a
certain Adolf Hitler wanted to annex in
1935 Mussolini signed a treaty with
France and Britain known as the stresser
from which guaranteed Austrian
independence you see mo Cellini didn't
really like the Nazi regime in Germany
and the whole German master race thing
made him uncomfortable because he you
know wasn't a German the stresser front
fell apart when Italy invaded Abyssinia
nowadays called Ethiopia which was
conquered by 1937 Mussolini also sent
volunteers to fight in the Spanish Civil
War and in this conflict in the previous
Hitler had given Italy Germany support
and relations between the two countries
improved Mussolini now felt that Britain
and France his time had come and gone
and that Europe would now revolve around
the Rome Berlin axis hence where the
Axis powers get their name Italy in
Germany continued their United Front
over the coming years in 1938 Italy
sided with Germany over the annexation
of Austria and it's later dismemberment
of Czechoslovakia Germany sided with
Italy in 1939 when it sent an ultimatum
to King Zog of Albania to accept Italian
overlordship he refused but there was
nothing that Albania could do and so
annexation in May of 1939 Italy in
Germany signed the pact of steel and
alliance in which both countries
promised to help the other out in the
event of war on September the 1st 1939
Germany invaded Poland and suddenly
world war ii mussolini wouldn't bring
italy into the war until mid 1940 after
the fall of Paris in the October of 1940
Mussolini came up with a brilliant idea
let's invade Greece this was to put it
mildly a complete disaster and Italian
troops were trounced by the Greeks which
forced the Germans to come down and bail
them out and over the next couple of
years things got much worse the tide of
the war turned against the Axis powers
Italy lost its colonies in East Africa
lost many troops aiding with the
invasion of the Soviet Union and after
the Battle of El Alamein lost its Libyan
colony in mid-1943 Sicily then Italy
proper was invaded shortly after this
news September 1943 Mussolini was
deposed and arrested Germany then
occupied the north of Italy and set up a
puppet state the Italian social Republic
which was led by Mussolini because he
managed to escape the rest
of Italy under Victor Emmanuel the third
join the Allies and declared war on
Germany the Italian social Republic was
plagued by issues of partisans Italians
who resisted Mussolini's rule and they
did a great deal of damage to its war
effort by April 1945 the front lines
look like this and on the 25th of that
month the Republic collapsed two days
later Mussolini was captured by
partisans and shot the next day the war
and fascist Italy was over in the
aftermath of fascist Italy not much
changed the same liberals and
conservatives who had been given power
by Mussolini retained it after the war
of course Italy did see a return to
democracy and in 1946 held a referendum
on the monarchies existence Victor
Emmanuel had abdicated on behalf of his
son Umberto ii to make the monarchy more
appealing but the italian people voted
to abolish the monarchy in 1946 and thus
the Republic of Italy was born I hope

there are tens of thousands of children

getting independent information about
isis military training of children
isn't easy thousands of syrian refugees
now live in turkish border towns
most people are afraid to talk because
they fear isis sympathisers
are here too but some children were
willing to speak out
on condition of anonymity
this 14 year old boy says he joined isis
after they convinced him they were pure
muslims
but when they threatened to kill his
brother he says he lost faith in isis
and fled isis propaganda videos
show children being put through rigorous
physical training
but boys who've undergone isis training
say they are
also being taught something much more
dangerous
isis calls these children cubs of the
caliphate
the boy says from what he saw children
are being systematically recruited
across
isis-controlled territory into the three
different
isis fighting units
this is video shows a stage of basic
training for children
where they're coerced to commit violence
all of this seemingly unaffected by
hundreds of coalition airstrikes
it's physically hard but the main aim is
to create a new
army of unquestioning and what isis
deems
ideologically pure fighters
it's that loyalty that isis is
exploiting for another horrifying
purpose
it starts with showing the children
videos
of suicide attacks
and how how young would be the youngest
boy that wants to be a suicide bomber
that you saw

[Music]
convincing young children to sacrifice
their lives without question
requires intensive indoctrination

children are taught to spy on their
parents who risk
death if they object to their children
joining isis
boys are routinely gathered in town
squares
where they're offered money and food to
join isis
and fed anti-western tirades
this ten-year-old boy was among those
isis tried to recruit
the boys say they are sat in front of
big screens and forced to watch videos
of isis brutality
propaganda videos like this which shows
the recent execution of
syrian soldiers in palmyra
[Music]
they say they're forced to watch real
executions too
but perhaps most disturbingly of all
isis releases videos
showing executions being carried out by
boys themselves
like this boy who is shown beheading a
syrian officer
or this boy who apparently executed two
alleged russian spies in january

boys are told they too will be killed if
they don't join

basket ball a fast-paced physically
demanding sport that keeps audiences
around the world on the edge of their

basketball most people think of players
such as Michael Jordan Kobe Bryant Larry

to put lots of points on the scoreboard
but basketball is a team sport all fight
positions on a team are responsible for
the outcome of the game the best player
may sink the most shots but the most
pivotal player on the team controls the

effectively on the court and most
importantly utilizes the individual
strengths of his or her teammates to
create scoring opportunities this skill
set defines the position of the point
guard point guard is uh you know the guy
that's responsible for running his team
I think it's it's a really difficult
sport to play without a point guard you
know cuz I think everyone has individual
responsibilities but very few positions
or roles on the court have the
responsibility of everyone a point guard
is is a key component of any successful
team you know you look at some of the
most successful teams in the in the
history or in the country that win at
the highest level and all of them have
elite point guards that are distributing
it and scoring and running the show as a
coach would want at a very high level
controlling the tempo of a game involves
both slowing down and accelerating the
momentum of the team when in possession
of the ball either strategy can be
implemented but certain situations will
force the point guard to use one or the
other during the game slowing a game
down
and speeding the game up is controlling
the tempo you have to know when it's how
much time is on the clock with the shot
clock whether it's 30-second or it's
nine seconds you guys take good shots
within those possessions to further be
counted as a good possession so it's
controlling the game my philosophy is
you need to give the point guard a lot
of freedom and a lot of ability to make
decisions and be creative we like to
play an up-tempo style of basketball
where we're running or pushing the
basketball and and you've got to be able
to trust the point guard to not turn the
ball over and make good decisions the
fast-break is a scoring opportunity in
which the ball on defense is turned over
and in most cases given to the point
guard to move up court as quickly as
possible for a potential basket why the
point guard because speed superior ball
handling and court vision are all
necessary to accomplish this task in the
fast-break you want to get the ball to
the point guard when guards have the
ability to push up the floor they're our
best ball handlers they're our best
decision-makers that's it's really just
a point guards special to use to run the
fastbreak
I think fast breaks are incredibly
advantageous anytime you got a defense
in transition we might have a numbers
advantage you know opportunities arise
for easy baskets but also a defense
that's in transition has a really hard
time setting up so it's really hard to
help and rotate or to be organized so
transition opportunities can kill a
team's defense communicating effectively
is essential for anyone in a leadership
position every individual on the court
should be talking but in order for a
team to function properly one player
must be heard overall the rest
the point guard needs to be able to
delegate and give responsibilities to
his teammates and make sure you know
it's clear on what he's expecting to be
even more clear on that on the
expectations and communication and I
think that's absolutely vital to any
team success communication can be huge I
think for a team in general but for a
point guard he was kind of responsible
and some
and his part psychologist for his team
has to understand where the team is at
the state of the team the state of the
psychology of its individuals you know
what they've gone through this season
you know those type of things I think a
point guard has to constant way up and
be able to steer the ship and
advantageous position not only with
certain individuals but as a group when
the team's best scorer is shut off by
the defense the team must then rely on
the individual strengths of its players
the point guard knows these strengths
and uses them in a coordinated manner to
create an entity much stronger than a
single player an efficient team I think
it's pretty dangerous to piggyback off
one player I mean it's a team sport so
if you're gonna rely heavily on one
player you leave a lot of risk or other
things to chance well I think that
obviously 90% of teams have a best
player that you're gonna lean on but
they have to be supportive so how does
the point guard bring all the pieces of
the puzzle together effective passing is
one of the ways shooting and driving to
the basket is good for a point guard to
have but the most vital asset is passing
because they have to give the most
dominant player in the ball where he or
she is comfortable on floor whether it
be in a post or on a wing normally the
point guard usually assists me when I
score I'm usually in the in the low post
area block to block you know just
working around that area just you know
being a big that's that's my job to work
around those areas so when the point
guard gets in the lane and he's you know
he's good gathering two guys three guys
on him to just you know creating a havoc
then he can dump the ball off to me I
think it's very important to give the
point guard the ability to divert from
from the play and allow him that
creativity to make a play I think
there's definitely a point in games to
to when to give that freedom and when to
make a play and see something and
capitalize off of it as opposed to an
execution that you need at the end of a
game as a point guard I always you know
I think my nature is the pass I always
wanted to create opportunities for my
teammates I wanted to get them easy
opportunities so they felt good about
themselves
but I also felt
like in order to create opportunities
for my teammates I had to be aggressive
to score just put pressure on the
defense and the defense left me with an
opportunity to create a shot I had to
take it but you know in my heart I wish
they would open up passing lanes and I
can make them pay that way so that I can
involve a teammate you know you
definitely have go-to guys on a team but
it's really important to develop a
chemistry with those guys so that you're
stacking the deck in their favor and
your favor by putting them in positions
to succeed as time goes by basketball
will progress and new faces will change
the game as we know it however one fact
will remain certain basketball is a team
sport where there is a successful team
there is a point guard controlling the
tempo communicating effectively with
teammates and creating scoring
opportunities what's the point simply
the most important position on the team
you

oh
[Music]
my Lord
to everyone hope you are having an
amazing day this is Jim young and
welcome back to my channel this time I'm
here at Mount Everest and this video is
about the rural life here in winter
village just near to Mount Everest and I
hope that you will enjoy this video
let's begin this beautiful Rural Life
here at Mount Everest
This Is Tashi 24 years old who lives
near Mount Everest and her husband works
in lhasa all summer earning the main
income of the family so at the moment
she lives with her parents
and her morning always starts earlier
than everyone else in the family
that she's one years old son and this is
how he start his day changing rubber's
diaper is the very first thing Tasha's
does when the baby wakes up
there are trashy's parents Doma and
tension and their day begins with a
prayer for the happiness to all sentient
beings
[Music]
hahaha
they have two houses one day built
themselves 10 years ago and the other
one the government built for them last
year wow is that Tibetan Kung Fu Tashi
seems to be very good at carrying
children actually the state stipulates
that every child must go to school but
does she only went till to high school
and had to give up due to family reason
but now she has opened a tent Homestay
at Everest Base Camp and her life has
gradually improved
Natasha's first job in the morning is
cleaning the stove
normally in Tibet we will pour the burnt
coward and Ash in the toilet because one
is in order to clean up the garbage and
the other is to remove the smell even
though we have a gas cylinders but in
rural Tibet we prefer to use yak and cow
dung as the main fuel because everything
tastes much much better than cooking on
gas cylinder
[Music]
thank you
while her son is in the care of her
mother does she use of this time to
clean up all the house
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
and finally she has time to wash her
face and do makeup and now she's weaving
colorful braids with Tibetan
characteristic which also means that she
is married
[Music]
and she usually spends about five
minutes doing makeup but this 5 minutes
is a favorite time of the day
[Music]
55 years old and today his neighbor
asked him to help with farming
[Music]
and as I noticed that in this Village
they always help each other in every
work like farming building houses
Etc I also think that they never need
help from Outsider and looks like they
can do most of the work in this Village
by themselves or helping each other
yeah looks like they keep the tradition
of farming with horses and Yaks even
nowadays but actually most other
villages in Tibet use tractor for
farming so this kind of traditional
farming way is really rare nowadays and
here in this village with altitude of
4800 meter they mainly grow barley
[Music]
oh
and finally Tashi start with the family
morning breakfast preparation and Tashi
says that she's still not good at
cooking but her specialty is to make
pancake which she make for her son every
single day so growing up she was never
really interested in cooking but learned
a lot by using recipes so that she can
make her family happy and interestingly
in Tibet recent studies shows that these
days 70 of Mother's work which 30 years
ago was less than 10 percent which means
women power in Tibet is growing so fast
now she can finally have her morning
butter tea wait wait don't bite your mom
that's Tasha's mother Doma 46 years old
she has four children Tashi as the
eldest child of the family and the other
three son are still in school and as a
mother Doma always wants Tashi to spend
more time with her grandson so once they
are together Doma is so so happy to help
her with housework and now Doma is
frying cheese which is very high in
nutritional value and if you dry the
cheese you can store it for much longer
time
[Music]
um
and in rural Tibet once you are married
most of the responsibilities and
housework at the home are undertaken by
the housewife like Tashi and usually the
husband goes out to work for family
income
and after their breakfast she starts
feeding animals and I think Tashi is
actually quite Rich because she have
eight cows two horses and 60 sheeps
oh
after feeding cows Tashi puts her son to
sleep so she can walk more and in
addition to baby food that she must also
make time to regularly breastfeed her
baby
[Music]
Tashi usually can get two kilos of milk
every day and to thanks to animals and
nature Dash's mom burns incense every
single day as a Tibetan tradition and
they usually don't drink Yak or cow milk
directly but they like to make it into
butter by separating the fat from the
milk and then it keeps for longer and
after milking the animals she takes them
to drink water
oh
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
and then Tessie collects all the cow
dance and she dried on the roof when you
are traveling in Tibet especially
tracking in Tibet you will find stacks
of white laptop near houses and many
Tibetan Villages many Travelers may be
curious about why Tibetan people pie so
much young tongues at the living place
in fact it is not strange at all because
yet dung is a traditionally biofuel in
Tibet for centuries Dash's baby creates
lots of dirty clothes so sometimes Tashi
do laundry twice a day
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
and after washing clothes tashi's mom
asked Dashi to cook the lunch
foreign
[Music]
potato for lunch
[Music]
looks like they also want to eat
potatoes
thank you
and do you know Tibetan food is mainly
composed of meat like beef Martin or yak
and very few vegetables are available
beef modern and Yak meats are high
calorie foods which helps to burden
living at high altitudes to resist the
cold but now with convenient
transportations all kinds of vegetables
can be bought as they like
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
that looks so skillful
[Music]
mmm that smells so organic and so
delicious
and now she had to cook it in pressure
cooker for another 8 minutes and in this
eight minutes she will go to water her
fields
and they normally planted barley in
April and harvesting it in August and
you know the main crops grown in Tibet
are Bali wheat buckwheat and cotton oh
it looks like the Lunch is ready
foreign
[Music]
The Lunch is ready it looks so so
delicious I wonder how it tastes like
[Music]
[Music]
and after their beautiful lunch Tashi
usually checks on her ships as they
spend most of their time browsing
Outdoors
[Music]
after hatching the ship for one hour she
goes home but on the way to home Tashi
and her son always go to the hot spring
to wash their feet and relax which is
her favorite time of the day
[Music]
[Music]
in Tasha's spare time she likes knitting
sweater and chatting with her mother
these are her Hobbies
[Music]
Tasha's father usually returns home
around 6 PM after working in the fields
order to pass on what the older
Generations Left Behind Tasha's father
would teach her tibetan-gita and
traditional Tibetan dance for half an
hour every day
[Music]
and Tasha's mom goes to pray to Mantra
Chapel while they practice dancing is
the happiest thing she does
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
and when she got home her husband was
suing and preparing new prayerflex for
their family because tomorrow is the
most important day in Tibetan Buddhism
called sagada Festival
[Music]
so Tashi wants to make baliso for dinner
tonight this soup is so simple and
nutritious
[Music]
too loud
I think it was not
and do you know the three basic and most
stable food of tea bats are butter tea
barley and Yak meat barley being the
most important crops in teapot is used
extensively in the form of flour
[Music]
so this is all about today's video and I
hope you enjoyed watching this video
this is welcome to Tibet we are the one
who can show you the original t-bat bye
bye
[Music]

Winter celebrations are popular across the 
world with Christmas dominating much of the  
western tradition. It's a winning recipe of the 
things we love: friends, family, gift giving,  
singing, feasting, partying, and more. The 
Romans too celebrated Christmas as far back  
as the 4th century AD. However before 
that they had their own winter holiday  
which honestly blows the 
stockings off our own tradition.  
It was a weeklong mardi-gras style street 
festival fueled by endless drinking where  
slaves became masters and fools were crowned king. 
You had all your classic holiday style carolling  
and gift giving though far far naughtier with 
a healthy does of ancient blackjack and hookers  
sprinkled on top. This was the festival of 
Saturnalia, Rome’s awesome pagan Christmas.
i spend a lot of time reading history books

Like many people in the ancient world, the Roman 
year was filled with festivals. These celebrated  
all kinds of important events but were aimed 
mostly at making sure the gods were kept happy.  
After all, there was nothing more important for 
the well being of the individual and the state.
Such holidays were known as dies ferialis. There 
were many of these every month, each with their  
own specific traditions. Generally speaking, the 
more important festivals coincided with major  
events, like the change of seasons or the new 
year, with the relevant god or gods taking center  
stage. A short list of some of those festivals 
includes the Lupercalia in February, the Liberalia  
in March, the Bona Dea and the Lemuria in May, the 
Ludi Apollinaris in July, the Herculi Invictus in  
August, and the Saturnalia in December. While all 
of these certainly merit their own episode, today  
we will be focusing on Rome’s end of year festival 
that would later transform into our Christmas.
As with most other Roman religious customs, 
Saturnalia traces its origins back to the Greeks.  
It is this hellenic civilization which 
influenced Roman mythology early in its  
development and would continue 
to do so over the centuries. The  
Roman god Saturn for example is roughly 
synonymous with the Greek god Cronus,  
both of whom are associated with rebirth, 
harvest, and heralding a new golden age.
In Rome, the holiday of Saturnalia started out 
humbly as an agricultural festival set around  
the winter solstice in December when the people 
would collect their last harvest of the year.  
As they concluded this work they would mark the 
occasion by honoring Saturn. This would be done  
at the temple of the harvest god at the foot of 
the Capitoline Hill. Here Rome’s priests would  
gather at the head of the population with the 
upper classes wearing their best togas and the  
plebeians wearing their finest tunics. A parade 
of bulls, the largest of the year, would then be  
brought in and sacrificed. The event was carried 
out under the watchful eye of Saturn himself.  
The way this worked is the priests would actually 
bring with them a statue of the god bound in wool.  
As the ceremonies began, they would 
ritualistically unwrap the statue  
and place it on a couch. Symbolically this 
represented the idea of rebirth where Saturn  
would appear like a newborn child “springing 
from the womb in the tenth month”. Once upon  
his couch, the god would then be able 
to partake in the feast which followed.  
For the remainder of the day, all forms of 
work and public business would be suspended.
Over time as Rome grew the holiday would continue 
to evolve. The official ceremony we have just  
described apparently underwent a series of reforms 
around the 3rd century BC when Greek practices  
were imported upon consultation with the Sibylline 
Books. Additionally, the festival would now be  
pinned to December 17, rather than arbitrarily 
following the final harvest. Because of the  
holiday's popularity, it was also incrementally 
expanded over time, from one feast day  
up to a total of seven. Let’s now take a closer 
look at the full glory of this Pagan Christmas.
The days leading up to Saturnalia would have 
Rome abuzz. As a major public holiday, it was  
the duty of the aediles to oversee the official 
preparations. With their reputation on the line,  
they would have been hard at work planning on how 
to make each year's celebration as memorable as  
possible. Part of this involved employing 
hundreds of laborers to transform Rome for  
the occasion by cleaning the streets, setting up 
decorations, and erecting temporary structures.  
This would be necessary to accommodate 
the huge swell in the city’s population  
caused by celebrants flocking in from the 
countryside. Afterall Rome was still a highly  
rural society with many small towns and farms 
dominating the land. Saturnalia as a harvest  
festival was a particularly strong magnet for 
farmers who were keen to give thanks to Saturn  
as well as to be able to reunite with old 
friends and acquaintances in the big city.  
Thus Rome’s homes, inns, and taverns filled 
with growing excitement as families looked  
forward to the festivities. With the days 
slowly ticking away, people were sure to  
be rushing to make final preparations and 
close out business before the holidays.
Finally the day would come. It was December 
17th. Starting in the early hours of the morning,  
people across Rome would awake and begin to stream 
into the Forum, eager to secure the best spots and  
celebrate the time honored tribute to Saturn. 
Once settled, they waited with baited breath.  
Soon their patience would be rewarded by a low 
rumble that would begin to grow and grow until,  
in the distance, its source was revealed. A grand 
parade was making its way through the streets of  
Rome. At its head were the priests and senate and 
behind them a seemingly endless line of bulls.  
This procession made its way past the throngs of 
onlookers until eventually coming to a stop before  
the Temple of Saturn. Here the animals would then 
be sacrificed and a great feast prepared with a  
reclining statue of Saturn as its honorary 
guest. Surely the god would be most pleased  
by this dazzling display of piety. Rome’s good 
fortune for the following year had been secured.
Thus ended the official component of Saturnalia. 
All public business was stopped on this day,  
and would remain closed for the duration of 
the festival. No law courts were conducted,  
all schools were closed, and even the 
mechanisms to declare war were shut down.  
This was a time for celebration, and the 
Romans were particularly good at that.
The following free flowing festivities were 
guided only by customs. But while un-regulated,  
they did share the common theme of a world turned 
upside down where traditional roles and social  
norms were inverted. It seems that this may have 
gotten its origin as a nod to the idea of a return  
to Saturn’s Golden Age which had existed before 
rank and order, before slavery and property.  
Now was a time to make this 
edenic existence a reality.
The first sign of change were the holiday 
clothes. During the festival people traded  
their bland togas for brightly colored garments 
and everyone from Emperor to slave wore the felt  
pileus cap which traditionally signified one’s 
status as a free man. The second sign of change  
was the new social order. Each family would 
select a “princeps” or leader of Saturnalia  
who was typically of lower status. This might be 
a child or servant. Slaves were treated as equals  
and might even be elevated to the point that their 
former masters served them. Reportedly slaves  
were exempt from punishment and even allowed to 
insult their masters - within bounds of reason.
This all came together at the grand public 
feast on the first day of Saturnalia following  
the religious ceremony at the temple of Saturn. 
The aediles for the year would actually foot the  
bill and plan out the banquet which meant that 
its appearance depended on who was responsible  
and how much money they had. Most of the 
time, tables would be set up in the forum,  
the only open space large enough 
to hold such a large population.  
The aediles would coordinate with the hundreds 
of local bakeries and other food providers who  
worked overtime to build up a massive stockpile 
for the occasion. The meals were as extravagant  
as possible and became truly incredible 
with the rise of the cosmopolitan Empire.
Arriving at the feast, one would witness a truly 
impressive display. From the bakers came the best  
breads, tarts, spiced cakes, pastries, and "little 
Gaiuses," while from the merchants and farmers  
came produce of every description: plums, pears, 
apples, nuts, dates, and more. They would be  
incorporated into dishes, made into candied fruit, 
and eaten whole. In addition, meats and wines from  
every corner of the empire were set out to give 
the illusion of a truly unlimited river of drink.  
Even rare delicacies were served to all, 
things that the upper classes ate and the  
poorer couldn't afford, like stuffed dormice, 
sow wombs, as well as varieties of exotic fish  
and birds - including lampreys and flamingos 
and peacocks. This fantastical banquet of  
dreams was gorged upon by all of Rome. For hours, 
everyone ate and drank to their heart’s content.  
When the meal was finally winding down, the 
shouts of “Io Saturnalia!” would break out.  
They heralded that the greatest party 
of the year had only just begun.
For seven days, people partied in a carnival 
like atmosphere akin to a New Orleans Mardi Gras.  
Everyone was encouraged to join in the fun, and 
sleep was in short supply. However there were  
of course your typical Christmas grinches. 
The philosopher Seneca apparently tried to  
convince a friend to replace the wild revelry with 
a quiet dinner and Pliny the Younger actually had  
a soundproof suite built so that he could get 
work done while his entire household partied.  
But peace and quiet was hard to come by. 
Here is a revealing quote from Libanius: 
“Night falls but no one sleeps. 
The common people engage in songs,  
wild dancing, and mocking jests. They 
do this even in the commercial district,  
barging in, pounding on doors, shouting and 
mocking. Some people are angry with what they  
hear, but others consider it an occasion for 
laughter. No one present is so austere that  
he censures these goings-on; even he who is too 
self-controlled to laugh breaks out laughing.”
Meanwhile the public spaces teemed with 
activity. The forum for instance drew  
huge crowds to see a range of itinerant performers 
from jugglers, to puppeteers, and snake charmers.  
Otherwise illegal gambling tables were 
set up as well and drew many participants.  
Sponsors might also pay for lavish displays 
of entertainment. In one instance we hear of  
female gladiatrices, dwarfs, buxom Lydian girls, 
and performers who came in from Syria to Spain.  
Emperors too got in on the fun 
and were not to be outdone.  
Nero was infamous for stealing the show by 
providing a truly impressive number of free  
prostitutes for the week. This was definitely a 
naughty Christmas that would seem at odds with  
our own holiday. However there were other 
traditions which will seem more familiar.
One of these was the practice of gift 
giving which took place throughout the week.  
The poet Martial writes about individual, 
personalized gifts with small greeting  
cards to go with them and even alludes to a secret 
Santa style form of gift giving that was popular.  
These ancient Roman presents could be anything: 
musical instruments, writing tablets, boxes of  
hobby supplies, beauty products, toothpicks, 
tableware, exercise equipment, weapons,  
or even a well-bred pig. Children generally got 
dolls while close friends were given special wax  
candles that were lit to signal the advent 
of a “golden age” coming in the new year.  
Augustus himself loved the holiday, and 
gave lavish and gag gifts in equal measure:  
“On the Saturnalia, and at any other 
time when he took it into his head,  
he would sometimes give gifts of clothing or 
gold and silver, sometimes all kinds of coins,  
including old pieces of the kings and foreign 
money, sometimes nothing but hair cloth, sponges,  
pokers and tongs, and other such things 
under misleading names of double meaning.”  
Sometimes the sheer volume of presents required 
for the holidays lowered their average quality.  
As Martial writes “Let everyone give his guest 
an appropriate gift. ‘But they’re all worthless  
garbage!’ you might say. Well no one says they’re 
not - no one would deny anything so obvious.“
Another tradition with modern echoes was 
the practice of the “Kings of Saturnalia”  
who were crowned by lot. During 
their reign they had to be obeyed  
with the sole requirement that their 
edicts be dumb commands. For example,  
telling everyone in the street to stop what 
they were doing and dance, to give the flute  
girls piggy back rides around the block, or to 
dunk an innocent bystander in a nearby fountain.  
However things could go too far if the liberties 
of the holiday crossed the line into reality.  
For example we are told that when Julius Caesar 
was celebrating Saturnalia after having won his  
civil war, his lieutenant, Mark Antony, made 
a big show of offering the crown of Saturnalia  
to Caesar. This was met by the fury of a booing 
crowd. The role was supposed to be a joke, making  
a mockery of the powerful. To give the joke crown 
to an actual dictator of Rome was not fun and  
struck a little too close to home. Clearly there 
were still some lines that should not be crossed.
At long last, the festival 
of Saturnalia came to an end.  
The “Kings” were symbolically dethroned to mark 
the occasion and everyone had their last hurrah  
with shouts of “Io Saturnalia”! Perhaps their 
throbbing heads would look forward to the days of  
calm which followed but it wouldn’t be long before 
they began to dream of next year’s festivities.
As one might imagine, the tremendous popularity of 
Saturnalia ensured that it lived on for centuries.  
This trend was further propelled because unlike 
many other Roman festivals, the Saturnalia was  
not tied to the city of Rome, and therefore 
gained traction across the entire Empire.  
After all, winter celebrations are a 
universal tradition which transcend borders,  
especially when they involve the winning 
combination of feasting, drinking, and partying.
Such was the popularity of Saturnalia 
that when Christianity rose to dominance  
in the 4th century AD the pagan holiday 
would be co-opted rather than cancelled.  
It appears this is one of the reasons 
Christmas was set just a few days after  
Saturnalia - December 25 instead of the 17th 
- and maintained many of the same customs.  
This hybridized holiday was a far 
rowdier event in these early days,  
and while the mass street partying has 
generally been toned down over the ages,  
many things are still held as tradition. For 
years, the Feast of Fools was an incredibly  
popular festival until it was banned by the 
Church in the 15th and 16th centuries. Wax  
candles are still a central part of a traditional 
Christmas with Advent candles and Freedman’s caps  
have generally been replaced by Santa hats, or if 
you live in Britain, paper caps and crowns. And,  
of course, the tradition of giving gifts to 
family and friends is still running strong.

we're on our way to the Russian Georgian
border it's believed that in spite of EU
sanctions Western goods are making their
way into Russia here a country Waging
War we're going to try to find out
whether this is true has anything
changed here in the last months
nothing it's like it's always been
[Applause]
[Music]
we're in Georgia the former Soviet
Republic is these days oriented towards
Europe
it wants to join the EU but it also
still has close economic ties with
Russia
what happens here in the Caucasus is a
determining factor for the success of
Western sanctions
Goods that could be used by the military
such as Cutting Edge technology
drones
or replacement parts for the oil
industry May no longer be exported to
Russia
Georgia officially supports the
sanctions but what is really happening
on the ground
we meet durico akania in the city of
tsukdidi she's a member of the local
Parliament and takes us to a border
control station
the police are watching us yes
this officer seems nervous he wants to
ask his boss if we're allowed to film
here
meanwhile one van after another passes
through the security gate some have to
stop for inspection
the green garbage truck however is
allowed right through
although over the next hours it keeps
driving back and forth every 10 minutes
it isn't clear what it's carrying but
what is clear is that the authorities
are looking the other way
di Rico Arcania says she knows what's
happening
is mostly inspect the normal trucks turn
a blind eye to Smugglers
this here is a special checkpoint
the Georgian city of zugdidi lies on the
disputed border with abkhazia under
international law the territory belongs
to Georgia but it has been under Russian
control since the early 90s many people
in abkazia have Russian citizenship
for the sanctions this means that
everything that enters abkhazia is de
facto in Russia that's why the disputed
border here is so important from now on
we can only film Undercover the officer
wants to get rid of us
our government knows about everything
that's going on here
we have
Norwegian Economist Airline Bulman
bjorkvett confirms this he has traced
the various routes over which sanctioned
Goods into Russia it also communicated
so you can actually stand with a truck
in Georgia but de facto will find
yourself on russian-controlled territory
is only one possible path
according to bjorkvet the data paints a
very clear picture
also for Russia so we can actually see a
good throwing into Russia from Central
Bridge we can see what kind of thing
that how many kilos or pieces occasions
and then we've also found some of the
goods in Russia for example drones with
camera having been exported by Western
countries have been found in Russia so
it's quite clear that Western goods are
flowing to Russia and spider sanctions
drive to the capital Tbilisi we've
arranged to meet in the Ministry of
Finance with otara khadsi from the
beginning of these actions we are doing
our best
um
the control of the goods and all the
companies all or the persons who are in
the sanctions list by this these seven
countries and other countries who can
imposed these sanctions
but statistics statistics indicate a
different picture while German companies
have been reducing their deliveries to
Russia
they've been increasing their exports to
Russia's Neighbors
to Georgia by 48 percent in the first
quarter of 2023 compared with the
previous year to Armenia by 132 percent
and to Kyrgyzstan by
773 percent
[Applause]
Georgia and Russia's other neighboring
countries have been suddenly become rich
enough to afford the increased Imports
the only plausible reason for the rise
some of the goods are making their way
into Russia
most Georgians such as these protesters
are highly critical of their powerful
neighbor to the north
the overwhelming majority here want to
join the EU in NATO and show strong
solidarity with Ukraine
for opposition Member of Parliament Anna
Nach flushfili the question of sanctions
is a kind of litmus test for which
direction the government is steering the
country in
she wants Georgia to prevent dual use
items from reaching Russia
these can be used for both civil and
Military purposes such as microchips
the Prime Minister could not respond to
the question
give me a single act hello a bylaw an
order by a minister which regulates the
issue and makes Georgia protected
from the risk of becoming a black hole
because that you cannot govern a state
by Oral statements you need to have
legislative Acts
Airline Bowman bjorkvat doesn't think
this is a coincidence
they have neither the legal Frameworks
not available
for Georgia to export Russia or to
facilitate exports to Russia
if no corresponding laws or guidelines
exist
area in which trade of sanctioned
products ultimately goes unpunished
at the same time the Georgian government
knows that Russian troops are already
stationed on Georgian territory such as
in upkazia
these troops could reach Tbilisi in no
time
all this Stokes the conflict between
George's wish to Pivot Westward and the
harsh geopolitical reality
we meet Katya nicolasvillei
the accusations made by her
anti-corruption NGO the national agency
of public registry go even further
she takes us along to the city
administration's vehicle Fleet once
again we are given the brush off no
filming allowed nope
we go to the back of the property
there they are Russian Kamas trucks
which according to hatia nicolasvillei
were bought with taxpayer funds in 2022
after the war started
Kamas is a company that is half owned by
the Russian state
the Russian army uses kama's military
and armored vehicles in its invasion of
Ukraine the company is on the sanctions
list
trading with a company like this which
is financed by taxpayers money is a
serious offense
the fact that Georgia buys the trucks
from the camels but we can say that it's
the indirectly financing the war in
Ukraine which is a very terrible thing
DW contacted the mayor of Tbilisi for
comment but the inquiry remained
unanswered we drive to the edge of town
Western Vehicles as far as the eye can
see were at one of the biggest car
markets in the Caucasus since the start
of the war Russians haven't been allowed
to buy expensive luxury cars directly in
the west a sanction targeting affluent
Russians the ban also aims to prevent
the use of certain vehicles to transport
officers to the front
there is a lot of
use in having a strong diesel car an SUV
at the land of organ uh enter
battlefields so we see these cars being
used both for luxury and for Battlefield
purposes
High horsepower at markets like this
with a hidden camera we ask a dealer
is this
Georgians azeries and Armenians come
here to buy ordinary cars maybe they're
also buying the cars for Russia
it goes like this a kergis buys a car
brings it to Kyrgyzstan and sells it
there they're all middlemen here
foreign
so how would such a car get to Russia
one option is completely legal
the car travels via Azerbaijan and the
Caspian Sea to Kyrgyzstan
from there it's easy as Kyrgyzstan has a
customs Union with Russia
we keep looking hardly anyone wants to
talk to us
[Music]
thank you
we discovered that there are apparently
several ways of getting around the
sanctions
the car goes to Russia then to
Kazakhstan and then to Kyrgyzstan by
train
do you understand the vehicle comes in
on a rail car
that's the official route but the
Traders hint that once the car is on
Russian territory there's no guarantee
its Journey won't end there
we hear that another route to Russia
goes via Armenia and decide to go it's a
two-hour drive to the Georgian Armenian
border filming is strictly prohibited
just before the Border are car haulers
the drivers don't want to say anything
on camera
on this export route a car is brought
from Georgia to Armenia and is given new
papers there
Armenia is part of the Customs Union
with Russia meaning a car can go from
Armenia to Russia completely legally
back in Georgia's capital Tbilisi we
want to find out exactly how it works
and try to send a luxury car to Russia
ourselves
this Mercedes from an Iranian dealer
catches our eye
the car is in great condition with
hardly any miles and a leather interior
we agree on 55 thousand dollars
is there a way of getting the car to
Moscow
we're told the car could be exported via
Iran in the Caspian Sea to Russia
another possible loophole that's enough
for us and we cancel the purchase
it's becoming clear that in this highly
complex geopolitical region many
well-intended Western sanctions quickly
fail when they clash with reality
our next test one of Georgia's Key Port
Towns on the Black Sea potty
to really hurt Russia's economy Russian
exports of raw materials have to be
targeted as these are moscow's biggest
source of income
Western sanctions are meant to stop
Russian oil shipments by sea
but when we meet vazo urushazi from an
anti-corruption NGO he tells us there is
evidence indicating that raw materials
from Russia are being traded here in the
port
this is a base for the Russian company
rosneft petroleum products from Russia
are brought here
then documents are altered to obscure
the origins and then they're exported to
third-party countries
by rail for example near the harbor we
find wagons which transport the
petroleum products onward
the signs say that they originate in
Moscow and Saint Petersburg with these
Logistics oil products can easily be
transported further
Ireland baldman bjorkvet says that
Russia has generally been very quick to
find ways to export oil in spite of the
sanctions
has been re-flagging of tankers there is
a big Shadow Fleet which consists of
maybe 10 of oil or oil tankers in the
world
so we see unfortunately that Russia is
breaking itself to get access to a to a
shadow Fleet which provides for their
exports our final test
we drive directly to the Russian border
if trickery deceit and smuggling are
even taking place here then it's likely
that turning a Blind Eye Is Happening by
Design
the sheer number of trucks waiting here
seems suspicious to us
this isn't what a drop in exports from
Russia is supposed to look like
how long do you have to wait to get to
the Border
three days
we've been creeping forward for four
days there are more trucks
we'd like to know whether inspections
are stricter since Western sanctions
were imposed
with the Georgians you're done in two
minutes and can drive on
[Music]
nothing has changed it's like it's
always been
it would be possible if the Georgia and
other neighbor countries had a will to
technically control his trade you can
check what is inside the drugs
but I don't expect countries like
Georgia or Kazakhstan or order of
Russia's Neighbors
to actually
control or even limit this train a
further sign of how LAX things are here
is this truck with one license plate
from Russia and one from Lithuania the
driver dismisses it they're only numbers
they're only numbers
we say goodbye to the drivers and make
our way back to the Capitol on our
journey across Georgia we found many
loopholes for circumventing the imposed
sanctions many people profit from The
increased trade volume
but the EU has just approved a further
sanctions package restricting the export
of certain Western exports to third
countries such as Kazakhstan Armenia or
Georgia
um experts like Ireland Bowman bjorkvet
welcome this as it's unlikely Western
companies who profit from the loopholes
would have taken action
I believe many restaurants waters are
aware of what is happening
um because of the magnitude of this
plane
and it is probably up to Western
countries themselves to ensure that the
sanctions are working coefficiently
what's certainly hurting Russia's
economy is that trade via third
countries raises the prices of products
that make it into Russia
and it got less money for its oil
exports when India and China demanded
big discounts riding on the fact that
the number of countries buying Russian
oil is limited
this has affected Russia's national
budget as it relies on the petroleum
business to a great degree and Georgia
the country must decide where it sees
its future if it still wants to join the
EU and NATO it will have to implement
Western sanctions on Russia effectively

Let's say you're a criminal
with millions or even billions of dollars,
but you have one big problem: Transferring
large sums of money or carrying suitcases
full of cash will raise eyebrows.
You need to launder the dough to make
the dirty money appear to be clean money,
so that then it can be spent anywhere in the
world (say, on real estate, luxury yachts,
strip clubs) no questions asked.
Fear not. With a little financial detergent,
your dirty money can become more or less untraceable.
 China leads the world in this ancient art.
Between 2002 and 2011, some $1.08 trillion
departed the country illegally, despite currency-control
laws that require people to obtain a permit
to exchange more than $50,000 a year worth
of yuan into any foreign currency.
But this is a truly international pastime.
Corrupt politicians, drug cartels, alimony
deadbeats, nearly everybody's doing it.
When it comes to money laundering there are
three main steps to doing it right. The first step is the placement.
Placement is the stage when the money enters
the financial system for the first time. In
this step, the money may be deposited in a
bank, added to the accounts of an existing
business or disguised as a transaction. 
The placement is usually achieved through
a series of regular small transactions. If
you are a criminal and you make the mistake
of a large amount of cash you are probably
gonna get caught right away. 
Of course, many people who attempt money laundering
schemes have no past experience and don't
know what behavior is likely to be flagged.
This step is widely considered to be the riskiest.
If the deposits are scrutinized at this stage,
none of the justifications that will exist
later in the scheme will yet be in place.
The second step of money laundering is the layering. 
Layering 
is the stage where the illicit money is put
together with legitimate money or placed in
constant motion. Layering usually involves
generating so many intricate transactions
that the dirty cash disappears into them.
Illicit money can be used to gamble, then
placed into stocks, then shuffled around in
different currencies and then used to buy
financial products like life insurance policies.
Layering can work in dramatically different
ways depending on the scheme. In all schemes,
however, the purpose of the layering stage
is to make it difficult for even a skilled
accountant to differentiate between money
that came from legal transactions and money
that came from funds that were placed for
laundering.
While layering is typically a safer stage
than placement, those who are not careful
often can still be caught easily if they make
mistakes. For example, if a business that
averaged $5,000 in transactions a day for
years were to suddenly start processing $10,000
in transactions a day, it might attract scrutiny.
The third and last step is integration. 
Integration is the stage where the money re-enters
the legitimate economy. When the money appears
to come from legal businesses or investments,
or the trail has become too difficult to follow,
the money can then be placed into larger-scale investments.
Integrated cash is often placed into luxurious
assets, properties, long-term investments,
and new businesses. Integrated cash may be
used to purchase assets that can be used to
facilitate future money laundering more safely.
There are several types of money laundering,
like casino schemes, cash business schemes,
smurfing schemes, and foreign investment schemes.
A complete money laundering operation will
often involve more than one of these as the money is
moved around to avoid detection. For instance,
proceeds from cash businesses can be gambled,
just as the success of a cash business
that has been infused with placed cash can
be used to justify investments or loans, which
come from cash placed offshore.
Let's talk about casino scheme.
The casino scheme works by funneling the money
through gaming. The money is converted into
chips, which are then briefly played with and then
transferred back into cash. Those chips are
usually converted by the launderer.
Often, the casino where the money is being
laundered is in a different nation than the
launderer' s nation of origin. This makes
it difficult for law enforcement in either
country to gather evidence that might reveal
proof of the money laundering.
When we talk about the casino scheme, the
placement stage happens when the money is
delivered to the proxy who will take payment
in cash and then change it into chips. In
some countries, travel agencies provide casino
chips as part of their packages. Paying for
these in cash can be a smart way to avoid
getting your cash moved without electronic records.
The Layering step is when the money is laundered
through gambling, the layering stage happens
when the cash or chips are carried into the
casino and used for gambling. Usually, very
few of the chips are used for gambling because
of the risk of losing. Instead, the chips
are lightly used for several hours and then
converted back into cash.
The receipts from the cashout are used as
evidence of the cash's legitimacy. There
is no record of how many chips were carried
into the casino, so the launderer can plausibly
claim that small amounts were carried in and
the larger sum comes from winnings.
The money laundered through casinos is relatively
easy to integrate. Once the winnings have been reported and any taxes have been paid, the
money can be used for any other purposes.
The cash business scheme is one of the most
used and popular schemes for laundering large amounts of physical cash. Even today, there
are a lot of businesses who handle most of
their transactions in cash. Illicit cash can
be inserted into these transactions at a fast
or slow pace.
Laundering money through cash-intensive businesses
was the preferred method of the famous gangster Al Capone. He evaded investigators for years
by funneling the money his crimes generated through his small empire of laundromats.
The term money laundering was coined by the agents investigating him.
The placement for a cash-intensive business
scheme involves direct cash payments to the
owner or manager of the establishment. The
money to be laundered for the day is brought
to the premises of the business. It stays
in a safe place until it can be added to profits
for the day through one of several methods.
When the money is laundered through cash businesses,
the layering stage takes place when fake transactions
are slipped into the books throughout the
day. These transactions may take the form
of fake customers, or through extra services
tacked onto legitimate transactions, with
the difference added from the placed money.
Cash-intensive business schemes often extract
the cash through daily profits. This scheme
requires the money to be laundered kinda slowly,
but a decent amount is ready every single
day, so, it's making it more liquid for
the launderer. Taxes are paid on the reported
profits, and the money can now be used for
any purpose.  
Now let's talk about the smurfing scheme.
The term smurfing refers to the practice of
distributing small amounts of a larger cash
amount to a series of partners who then deposit
the money in incremental amounts. Smurfing
is used to get around the currency reporting
requirements that banks are required to observe
in a lot of countries. Small quantities that
come from many partners are less likely to
trigger an automatic report.
The placement stage starts with the cash being
distributed through a network of people, smurfs,
who can be trusted to deposit the money back
again on schedule. Larger criminal organizations
are more likely to use this strategy because
they already possess a big network of obedient
members.
The layering stage for this type of scheme
happens as the money is deposited back into
one or many different accounts. More advanced
smurfing schemes will try to make sure that
the money is deposited in ways that avoid
automatic detection. The cash must not just
be deposited in small amounts, but in varying
amounts and at different intervals.
The money can be extracted as it is moved
back into the account. While this scheme avoids
automatic detection, it is not as safe as
the other schemes. If the deposits do come
under scrutiny, it could be difficult for
the launderer to explain why the deposits
were made.
The foreign investment scheme
A lot of countries are allowed and encouraged
to invest in US businesses. However, the IRS
has little power to account for how the money
used in these investments was accumulated.
In some cases, the money comes from illicit
activities. The launderer delivers the cash
to the foreign investor, who then returns
it by making an investment into the launderer's
business.
The placement happens when the cash is delivered
to the foreign partner. In most successful
schemes, the launderer will not appear to
have any prior contact with the investor who
is holding the money. For all intents and
purposes, the money appears to be the property
of the foreign partner. 
The layering stage happens when
the foreign business invests into
the legitimate, legal business using money
that was placed with them. These amounts are
usually larger than in other schemes, but
difficult to prove illegal.
The money in this scheme can be more difficult
to extract, in spite of the fact that large
amounts can be moved. Investments into a business
must be credibly used within that business
and for that business. The money can be extracted
from the profits that the investment generates,
or from high executive salaries funded by
the original investment.

The Badlands.
Home to some of the strangest creatures to ever walk this earth.
In our previous episodes, we’ve explored these arid lands
and examined the bizarre culture of “bots."
However, today we’ll be looking at some species
we may call, more…“uncivilized.”
In order to do this, we must look into a domain  
that greatly differs from the typical deserts of New Mexico,
and travel to their polar opposites.
Once serving as battlegrounds in the Great Gravel Wars,
these bodies of water have been reclaimed by nature,
and now house marine life.
This documentary will celebrate these few remaining bastions of wildlife,
and reveal what we must preserve,
to ensure people and nature thrive.
Join me, as we observe these fascinating aquatic 
animals in their purest, and most innocent forms.
Welcome, to the wondrous world of water.
Welcome, to the Great Blue.
Water is a scarcity in the dusty plains of New Mexico,
but a couple reservoirs may still be found.
Here is one of these oases, 2fort.
Accidentally built upon a massive freshwater spring,  
the rudimentary tunnel systems are flooded with the earth’s lifeblood.
Unfortunately, the industrial nature of human
 influence proves to be inescapable.
The surrounding forts have leaked lead into the groundwater, 
contaminating it,  
and making it near uninhabitable.
And yet, life goes on.
The Pyroshark. Scientific name, “Ardere Selachimorpha.”
Common name, “stupid.”
It is an evolutionary anomaly; a crossbreed between a common shark
and the single-braincelled organisms known as “Pyro Mains.”
Unlike most species of shark, 
this particular one has evolved to live 
within freshwater environments.
Curiously enough, there are no signs of any biological adaptations
that would allow the pyroshark to process fresh water.
The current running biological theory is that this unlikely cross-breed
is simply too stupid to realize it should not be alive.
This particular pyroshark is 
in its first stages of infancy.
The parents are nowhere to be found.
But not to worry!
The pyroshark is a precocial species, and aparticularly violent one at that.
It is born with all the tools necessary for it to survive.
A foolish tourist wanders near the edge, ignoring all safety precautions.
A decision he will soon sorely regret.
He slips and falls into the depths below.
Sensing a disturbance in the waters,
the pyroshark makes its way towards its next target.
A swift kill.
But wait! It seems that the pyroshark is not alone in its hunt.
A local school of piranha scouts contest the shark for his meal.
Small yet deadly, these piranha scouts will attack in groups.
The leader of the pack gets a swift first strike.
The shark retaliates!
A swing…and a miss!
The alpha piranha dodges and weaves, expertly evading 
the shark’s attacks!
The rest of the piranhas, seeing their leader effortlessly
 dance around the shark,
begin to gain the confidence to approach their next meal.
But suddenly…
A lucky strike by the pyroshark.
Like a pack of schoolyard bullies, the piranhas 
disperse after seeing their leader fall.
The pyroshark barely comes out victorious.
He retreats back into his cove 
to heal and fight another day.
We now leave the troubled waters of 2fort
to a more serene marine ecosystem.
In the temperate lands far to the east of the Badlands, 
we come across a tropical island.
Though not completely untouched by human influence, 
this lush bay is rife with plant life and animal life alike.
The beaches of Banana Bay remain relatively untouched year round,  
but during the summer months, the island receives visitors.
The turtling engineer. A species remarkable in its intelligence,  
far surpassing that of the pyroshark.
They arrive from deep within the depths of the ocean,  
colonizing the beaches quickly and efficiently.
While the turtle engineer itself is a rather soft and 
 defenseless target,
the turtle has evolved and developed an ingenious 
 defense mechanism.
A protective perimeter of sentry guns, dispensers,  
and teleporters is rapidly established along the coast.
These turtles are territorial creatures, and 
will guard their new lands with an iron fist.
At first, it is not clear why these turtle engineers 
have to be so protective of their territory.
The native denizens of the island are not 
particularly aggressive towards adult turtles.
In fact, it is quite the other way around.
The turtles are the ones who pose a threat to the island’s inhabitants. 
Any monkeys unfortunate enough to step too close 
to the beach are met with extreme prejudice.
Venturing deeper into the makeshift colony,
we soon see the reason for their nest of defenses.
Ah. The miracle of life.
The secluded alcoves of Banana Bay provide the perfect environment  
for the turtle engineers to usher in the next generation.
Once the turtle engineers have finished their business, 
they depart from the island.
The buildings are left behind, with the turtles putting full trust
in their machines to protect their eggs.
Over the course of the next 3 months, the buildings will break down.
However, before the buildings completely degrade, 
the turtle engineer eggs will have hatched.
Under the watchful protection of the sentries,
the next generation of turtles will have made it safely into the sea.
And of course, we would be remiss to not mention the 
 brackish waters closer to the mainland.
On this particular peninsula, a species of seabird 
 known as “Armoria Reskinia” thrive.
These nocturnal, semi-aquatic birds live and die by the ocean.
The sea is the provider of their sustenance,  
supplying a constant stream of slightly lead poisoned 
 mackerel directly to their doorstep.
Armoria Reskinia live in tandem with their urban environment,  
roosting on mann-made piers and using the elevation to help them dive.
However, fish is not the only source of food for these birds.  
Occasionally, a rare treat comes along.
An endangered spycrab foolishly peeks his head above the water-line.  
Long thought to be extinct in the wild, capturing one 
 on camera is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
Unfortunately, we cannot take any action in 
order to preserve the integrity of nature.
Another component of the birds’ diet is food
occasionally handed to them by humans.
A flock of avid bird watchers gaze upon the birds from a distance.
As mentioned earlier, Armoria Reskinia have adapted to their 
 urban surroundings.
Making the most out of the local tourists is one of these adaptations.
Resident wildlife officers have attempted to deter humans from  
feeding the birds in the past, but the attempts were unsuccessful.
Speak of the devil! It seems one of the tourists
 has chosen to ignore the warnings!
We will now observe what happens when humanity 
 comes into contact with the wild.
 
An alliance, most poetic.
Paralleling the stories of medieval falcon-tamers,
An olive branch of civilization extended towards the regal beast.
Um-
O-oh dear!
I don’t think this quite fits into our “G” rating.
C- Charlie!
CHARLIE!
Pull the plug! QUICKLY CH-

this video is proudly sponsored by
nordvpn more about that later on
in the same year that a reactor in the
uk satellite
another fire in the nuclear industry
took place in the rocky flats plant
in the u.s the event would go on to be
relatively unknown
until another fire at the same site was
discovered 10 years later
[Music]
september 11th is a date that has become
part of world history
however today's subject isn't the 9 11
that normally springs to mind
instead a fire in a glove box in a
plutonium process
building will be the focus for this
video i'm going to rate today's subject
matter here on a plainly difficult
disaster scale
located in golden colorado around here
on a map
the rocky flats plant is situated on 384
acres
inside a 6550 acre nature reserve
ground was broken in 1951 for a new site
to build
vital parts for the budding nuclear
weapons industry in the united states
the construction work in a pittsburgh
press article was estimated to cost
around 45 million dollars
the aec appointed dow chemical company
as the plant's operator
between 1952 and 1975.
the main goal of the site was to produce
plutonium pits which form
part of the trigger to an atomic bomb a
pit is a hollow plutonium sphere that is
imploded creating an explosion that
triggers the rest of the weapon
the demon core was a plutonium pit
however it wasn't hollow but instead had
two spheres with a ring in the middle
the site produced its first pit in 1953
and over the remainder of the 1950s
would grow to
27 buildings the facility manufactured
most of the triggers for the u.s atomic
weapons stockpile
that was until 1993 when production was
abruptly ended
the pits were formed from plutonium
buttons which looks pretty much how it
sounds as seen here from buttons the
plutonium was formed into the hollow
sphere needed for weapons production
via foundry and machinery work although
a vital part in the weapons production
process
rocky flats was only a link in the
manufacturing chain
as once the pits were created they were
sent off to the pantex facility near
amarillo texas
not only did the facility deal with
plutonium but also uranium and beryllium
as well as a myriad of chemicals
including carbon tetrachloride
used as a cleaning solvent in the
manufacturing process
the production buildings did not have
fire suppression systems due to the risk
of criticality instance
caused by water forming a moderator but
instead buildings were fitted out with
little combustible material as possible
and this seemed to work in a 1955
chemical explosion
which was effectively dealt with this
brings us on to september 11th 1957
and building 71 which was used in the
process for pit creation
as a side note building 71 was the first
production building at the site
room 180 contained glove boxes used to
protect operators from the radioactive
isotopes
some at rocky flats were up to 20 meters
in length with multiple lead line gloves
used to manipulate the tools needed for
machining and forging
the boxes were made of stainless steel
had reinforced plexiglass windows and
had
benelex shielding made of wood fiber and
plastic to protect
operators from neutron radiation
extraction fans were provided to vent
air from the glove boxes
to prevent any release of radioactive
dust multiple filters are provided
on route for any material before it goes
to building 71's vent stack
the ventilation system was equipped with
heat sensors which were intended to
switch off the fans preventing the
spread of a fire
which is great however this had been
disabled due to false trips slowing down
production
plutonium can be a fire hazard if
handled incorrectly
or not stored in a dry environment if in
too high of a humidity room the
plutonium can form hydrides on its
surface
which are pyrophoric and may ignite in
air at room temperature this risk
increases when the material is finally
divided
for instance in dust such as spontaneous
combustion can be a deadly event
with the potential to release
radioactive particles at 10 pm
this such incident began as a small
amount of plutonium
turnings spontaneously combusted
spreading the fire along the plexigrass
ten minutes later the fire was
discovered the cooling fans were powered
up to protect the firefighters from
contamination
as they attempted to use carbon dioxide
to quell the flames
however this spread the hot plutonium
dust into the filtration system
something that the heat sensors should
have prevented however this was disabled
plutonium burns in a similar fashion to
charcoal however the smoldering was a
perfect ignition source for the highly
flammable plastic within the glove boxes
after this failed and faced with an ever
building up fire
the firefighters used something that
they really shouldn't have been using
when dealing with plutonium
and that was water at 10 38 pm right
it's time to talk about this video

then a little bit of anonymity is pretty
handy
needless to say that if i didn't have no

thank you for listening to the advert
although it initially stopped the flames
which were from the burning plastic and
other flammable materials inside the
boxes
the moisture reached the plutonium
increasing its heat there was also a
massive risk to achieving a criticality
accident
as a water would help sustain the chain
reaction the air filtration system
itself posed risk
as the heat and moisture spread upwards
by the fans
ever since building 71 was first pressed
into service the filters had not been
replaced and were filled with plutonium
dust
which was much more susceptible to
moisture a minute after water was
introduced
a loud blast was experienced the force
bent the plenum steel frame
in doing so spreading the fire into the
filtration system
the explosion also destroyed the cap at
the top of building 71's smoke stack
on order of the health physicist
supervisor everyone evacuated the
building to escape the plutonium
contamination
which by now had spread throughout
building 71.
at 10 45 pm fire was now discovered in
the vital filter banks on the second
floor
the only thing preventing widespread
contamination of radioactive particles
released from the fire as the fire
burned contamination spread out from the
damaged smoke stack
engulfing the surrounding area at 2 am
the fire was declared knocked down
however it wouldn't be completely
stopped until 11 28 am
on the 12th of september it was
estimated that around 63 kilograms of
plutonium was present in room 180 at the
time of the fire
with 13 to 21 kilograms being involved
directly
it was estimated that around 500 grams
of plutonium 239 and 240
was released into the atmosphere however
due to the lack of proper monitoring
and almost immediate cover-up these
figures are an educated guess at best
the contamination was spread by winds
and sun was deposited in the soil
the material is dangerous once ingested
due to plutonium being an alpha particle
emitter
the highest risk of exposure of the
local population was the persons who
were exercising
or were working outside in areas where
the plume of plutonium particles was
near the ground
however some of the most at risk were
the firefighters who for nearly 13 hours
were exposed to the deadly plutonium
the highest dose was estimated to be 50
milligrams off site
the blaze heavily damaged building 71
necessitating the installation of an
incinerator in 1958
to dispose of the amount of contaminated
material
elements such as strontium-90 and
cesium-135
were detected as a result of the fire
hinting at a criticality event
however officials denied that such event
had occurred
the public wouldn't be aware of the
incident for just over a decade until a
second fire
also involving plutonium was fought also
using water
the only reports of the incidents in
local newspapers claimed that no one was
injured and no release of radioactivity
was recorded
and the damage costs were estimated to
be around fifty thousand dollars
the cleanup of building 71 started as
soon as the fire had ended
work resumed on a limited scale before
the end of 1957 but cleanup efforts
would be continued
all the way until early 1962. the
building would be pushed back into
service being renamed 771
with the whole site continue to produce
plutonium pits until 1993 when
production was transferred to oak ridge
national laboratory
this was only after the site was raided
by the epa and fbi in 1989
after numerous reports of staff relating
to deadly working conditions
really the incident in 1957 is only
scratching the surface
of his radioactive dumpster fire of a
place now don't worry i'll be doing
another video soon about the 1969 fire
and its wider impact on the site and

coffee over 125 million people today are
in some form employed in the industry
surrounding it worldwide helping to
bring the world the 400 billion cups of
coffee it consumes each year many in
fact consider having at least a morning
cup of coffee a necessary part of having
a productive day or at least a stable
one the main reason for this unless
you're drinking decaf is the famous
invigorating and generally safe drug
called caffeine coffee has helped to
fuel mankind in its various pursuits for
centuries but how long exactly where did
coffee come from and how did it take
over the world ladies and gentlemen
hello and welcome to fire of learning
i'm justin in this video we will be
exploring the fascinating origins of
coffee before we begin i'd like to thank
lamia buchrisse eric raider beth baird
mike fantasia stephen colona michael
mcginnis nicola lonesha everett white
anubis anarchy faceless buster david md
lynnae casperson blaine arahara carolis
and alan hastie for being our most
recent supporters on patreon they joined
these supporters who helped make these
videos possible also a past patron had
his name mispronounced jacob sewers is
actually jacob sivers this video is an
improved remake of a video i did years
ago now then let's get to it
many societies such as the united states
home to many of the world's most famous
coffee house chains consider coffee to
be a central part of their dietary
culture however though caffeine itself
has been consumed by humans in some form
since before recorded history for most
of human history coffee itself was
unknown to the world the story begins in
the late middle ages and early modern
era with the berries of a small tree
native to aromia a region of what is
today the east african nation of
ethiopia this is the homeland of the
kefaya plant when exactly people first
stumbled upon and consumed the berries
of the kefaya plant and felt the
stimulating effects of the red berries
or cherries is not known one legend
attributes the discovery to an ethiopian
goat herder named kaldi who lived
sometime between the 6th and 9th century
one day he noticed some of his goats had
become quite energetic after chewing on
the red berries of an unfamiliar shrub
made curious by his dancing goats he
dried the berries for himself and felt
these energizing effects believing his
discovery to be quite important he took
the berries to a local monk the monk
however rejected them and cast them into
a nearby fire however the smell of the
roasting coffee seeds within the berries
which are usually called beans although
they're technically not caught his
attention as well as the attention of
other nearby monks the beans were taken
from the fire ground up and mixed into a
cup of water thus the first cup of
coffee
this story which seems to come from
european writers from the late 1600s is
probably much more legend than history
one of a handful of legends pertaining
to the discovery of coffee in fact no
one knows who first discovered the
effects of coffee and we likely never
will however it is certainly quite
possible that the true story is not too
dissimilar
caffeine is a deadly poison
to insects
it's believed that caffeine naturally
functioned as a pesticide overloading
the nervous system of insects causing
them to die before they could consume a
large portion of the plant however that
same effect on a much larger creature
like a human or perhaps a goat is a much
more survivable and enjoyable experience
one way or another ethiopian locals
likely the gala tribe discovered this
effect of the coffee berry however it
does not appear that they were the first
to make a drink from the seeds rather
that appears to have happened in the
nearby islamic world like in africa it
appears that the arabs first chewed the
beans and made drinks from them which
historians believe were quite different
from modern coffee this may have begun
sometime around the 10th century or so
the persian scholar al-razi seems to
have mentioned the stimulating effects
of the berries around this time the
arabs called the drink they made from
the berries kabla a word interestingly
related to their word for wine and
likely the origin of the modern word for
coffee across most languages when they
began making coffee in its modern form
is not known but it seems to have been
sometime between the 10th and 15th
century there is clear written evidence
of the consumption of coffee in the
islamic world by at least the 15th
century a drink which they again gave
the same name as the other drink kabua
according to bennett alan weinberg and
bonnie k beeler in the world of caffeine
the earliest certain appearance of
coffee in its modern form comes from the
mid-15th century in the monasteries of
sufi monks in yemen which was just
across the red sea they also note there
is a strange lack of discussion about
coffee beans or potentially coffee
itself the beans being called boone or
booncham between the 10th and 15th
centuries with the exception of folk
accounts such as that of the sheik omar
his story is another one pertaining to
the supposed discovery of coffee he is
said to have survived off the berries
and the drink he brewed from them after
having been banished men introduced him
to his people in the 12th century
why this 500 year gap regarding the
discussion of coffee exists is yet
another coffee mystery anyway it appears
to have reached the city of moca in
modern day yemen by that time it soon
reached nearby mecca from there mecca
being a mecca of the islamic world after
all it spread out across the middle east
and north africa interestingly coffee
initially had a religious significance
to many muslims especially the sufis who
used it to assist in fasting during
ramadan as well as to aid them in
staying awake at night for prayers it
was also believed to have carried many
medicinal benefits some of which though
not all of course scientists today know
consuming it really does have quite
quickly though in a society which
forbade alcohol it became a drink of the
common people for normal casual use what
followed were places for men men of all
classes but men only to congregate and
consume the beverage these were the
first coffee houses women could consume
coffee at home though in some
circumstances they were allowed to sing
at coffee houses provided they were
hidden from view these coffee houses
became places of both relaxation and
games but also serious discussion and
argument not everyone approved however
other muslims felt that the ban on
intoxicants such as alcohol mentioned in
the quran should apply to coffee as well
furthermore coffee houses became sources
of trouble centers of debauchery
forbidden by islamic law and hotbeds of
political unrest indeed at certain
points and in certain places such as the
city of mecca in 1511 coffee and coffee
house bands were enacted forcing the
trade and consumption underground in
some cases trading and consuming coffee
was punishable by death the spread to
the christian world seems to have come
via the burgeoning ottoman empire which
ruled over parts of europe and much of
the middle east the ottomans conquered
yemen in 1536.
syrians introduced coffee to the capital
of constantinople in the 1550s and the
turks became very enthusiastic about it
many european merchants and travelers
first observed it there tried it on some
occasions and sometimes wrote of it
coffee's gradual introduction to europe
appears to have been through both war
and trade in 1565 the ottomans attempted
to conquer the island of malta they were
defeated however by the knights of saint
john they took ottoman soldiers as
slaves who introduced the maltese to
coffee decades later the venetians
became interested in the drink and
acquired it through trade becoming the
first to introduce the drink to the
continent throughout the late 1500s
coffee quickly spread to many other
parts of europe england france the other
italians and the dutch were especially
interested the people of europe began to
search for the plant which produced
these wonderful new beings the dutch
were the first to succeed in 1616 when a
sly merchant peter van der brooke
acquired them while in the city of moca
this was no simple task the yaminis
guarded their coffee supply closely
requiring that any beans which left the
area be boiled or roasted to prevent
germination however peter was not the
first to succeed in smuggling them a
muslim pilgrim had already succeeded in
bringing them to india by taping the
seeds to his stomach under his clothes
still burka's success was of great
importance to his people he took them
back to his home in the netherlands
where he began to successfully grow them
however such cold climates as northern
europe are not ideal for large-scale
coffee production thankfully for the
dutch however in this time they were in
the business of acquiring tropical
colonies such as the island of sri lanka
south of india the island of java in
indonesia and suriname in south america
the dutch east india company spearheaded
european coffee production in these
areas in the late 16 and early 1700s
fueling europe's new coffee addiction
for many years
other european empires would follow suit
in their warmer colonies as well
in 1720 gabrielle de clau brought coffee
to the island of martinique legend says
he introduced it to the island and kept
it alive on a ship by sharing his
limited water ration with it though in
truth others may have already brought it
there much of the coffee drink around
the world arabica is said to be
descended from his plants arabica by the
way is one of the four main varieties of
coffee drank around the world to this
day accounting for about 65 percent of
production the other main one being
robusta which makes up much of the
remainder liberica and excelsa are
somewhat rarer anyway coffee was also
farmed by the slaves of the french
colony of sandaming modern-day haiti
which would later begin to produce
massive amounts of coffee as well
the first european coffeehouses opened
in venice in 1645
the rest of europe followed suit with
thousands of copy houses springing up
throughout the continent in the
subsequent decades european coffeehouses
were not quite as rowdy as the middle
eastern counterparts as they already had
pubs with alcohol for that thus they
were more likely to become centers of
intellectual culture however that does
not mean they were not centers of
trouble at all coffee houses were
frequent meeting places for those
seeking to discuss new ideas new ideas
which often contradicted the ideas of
ruling political elites in 1675 charles
ii the son of a king who had had his
head cut off by political dissidents
after a civil war attempted to shut down
coffeehouses throughout england but
retracted his order when the public
outcry was too great likewise french
enlightenment philosophers were later
known for gathering in coffee houses in
the years prior to the french revolution
coffee wasn't always popular with those
supportive of the enlightenment however
in his book uncommon grounds mark
pendergast shares a quote from frederick
the great the 18th century king of
prussia and by the way friend of the
enthusiastic coffee addict voltaire in
which he denounced it he was recorded to
have said
it is disgusting to notice the increase
in the quantity of coffee used by my
subjects and the like amount of money
that goes out of the country in
consequence
my people must drink beer his majesty
was brought up on beer and so were his
ancestors and quote he then banned the
roasting of coffee outside of government
establishments for four years old fritz
was known for being a bit of a
curmudgeon in frederick's defense
importing coffee to prussia was costly
others however believed the coffee had
helped to bring sobriety to their
countries and were glad to see the
change
like in the islamic world christians
initially also had religious concerns
about coffee though their concerns were
not as strong they did have concerns
about a muslim drink becoming popular
among their people however when pope
clement viii tried it around the year
1600 he gave it his blessing it is
claimed and it may or not be true that
he said quote
why
this satan's drink is so delicious that
it would be a pity to let the infidels
have exclusive use of it we shall cheat
satan by baptizing it and making it a
truly christian beverage end quote and
thus the catholic world especially italy
and eventually france accepted coffee
and never looked back the italians in
particular would become creative with
coffee inventing many ways of having it
including espresso in victorian england
christian prohibitionists encouraged
coffee houses as an alternative to
alcohol a few branches of christianity
however eventually did decide against
coffee most famously the mormons in 1683
a massive ottoman army attempted to
conquer the austrian capital of vienna
at the battle of vienna they were
defeated by a combined christian force
who upon pillaging the ottoman army
camps found coffee initially they
assumed it was camel food so they burned
it but thankfully for them a commander
who had lived in the ottoman empire for
a time recognized the smell this helped
coffee's immediate spread throughout
central and eastern europe coffee was
very well received throughout europe
however throughout this time it should
be remembered that coffee was in
competition with tea for which the
british for example developed preference
this was the case in their american
colonies as well that is of course until
the tea act was placed upon them after
american patriots held the boston tea
party in 1773 tea became a symbol of
royal tyranny and americans began to
prefer coffee which they still do to
this day though it was expensive and
less common in america in those days for
example in 1774
john adams wrote to his wife abigail
saying quote t must be universally
renounced and i must be weaned the
sooner the better
caffeine was first separated from coffee
by friedlib ferdinand runge in 1819 at
the suggestion of johann wolfgang von
gotta coffee only reached isolationistic
japan in 1858 in the end the king of
coffee plantations would be brazil
coffee became popular there after the
country gained independence from
portugal in 1822. by 1852 brazil was
leading the world in terms of coffee
production much of this was through
slave labor in fact coffee production
played a large role in making brazil the
last country in the americas to abolish
slavery not doing so until 1888 and only
then in part because paid labor from
europe became cheaper to this day the
large warm and fertile country of brazil
remains the world's largest coffee
producer from 1850 until 1950 in fact it
exported more coffee than the rest of
the world combined since then other
countries namely vietnam colombia
indonesia and of course ethiopia have
begun to increase production each of
these countries lies between the tropics
of cancer and capricorn or what's called
the coffee belt a geographical belt
stretching around the planet where
conditions are ideal for growing coffee
today brazil produces one-third of all
the world's coffee in the industrial era
when coffee production became more
bountiful coffee began to move from
being a drink more often than not
associated with the upper classes to one
which fueled working people in their
gruesome labor conditions to this day
common folk fuel their labor across a
wide variety of fields with coffee
though as i mentioned brazil produces
coffee at great levels proportionally
speaking finland drinks more coffee than
any other country at over 26 pounds per
capita per year the rest of scandinavia
has high consumption levels as well if
you consider finland scandinavia anyway
of the american states new york is the
most interested in coffee
today coffee's popularity is stronger
than ever man it doesn't appear likely
that that popularity is going anywhere
with so many people consuming so much
coffee many wonder
how exactly is coffee affecting our
health
coffee has been viewed as a drug since
its beginnings indeed in its early days
it was perhaps viewed more as a drug
than as a comestible in its early days
it was said to cause impotence sterility
exhaustion dry up cerebrospinal fluid
and eventually cause paralysis inversely
others said that it was a remedy for
plague and that it prevented stillbirths
these claims weren't exactly scientific
but modern science has shown that there
are a number of benefits and drawbacks
to coffee some of which were indeed
suggested by the people of the past
overall coffee is considered very safe
when consumed at normal amounts i.e on
average three to four cups a day each
cup of normal coffee contains about 95
milligrams of caffeine almost four times
the amount in a cup of tea we all know
people who would call that rookie
numbers though that amount may be too
high for pregnant women coffee intake
may be associated with low birth rate or
even miscarriage but the science on this
is not very clear overall coffee may be
more beneficial to human health than
harmful many studies show coffee
drinkers seem to live longer than
non-drinkers and are at lower risk for a
whole list of diseases whether or not
this is causal that is to say whether or
not coffee itself is actually causing
people to live longer and be healthier
or if it's co-correlated with something
else is unclear coffee may also improve
gastrointestinal health lift mood and as
many are well aware give an individual a
feeling of increased energy still coffee
is not very nutritional in itself and it
can have negative effects especially
when consumed in excess or consumed by
individuals suffering from disorders
such as gerd an anxiety disorder or much
more seriously an unruptured aneurysm in
case you were wondering on average it
would take about 70 cups of coffee or
over four gallons at once to kill a
healthy adult though you would likely
begin feeling extremely unpleasant
before even nearing that number and find
yourself unable to go through with it in
fact you would likely die from water
intoxication well before caffeine
overdose more concentrated forms of
caffeine have been deadly however so be
careful about combining coffee with
other stronger sources of caffeine i

over the last decade the use of
electronic cigarettes commonly referred
to as vapes has seen a dramatic increase
marketed as a safer alternative to
smoking these devices offer a cleaner
option for adults looking to kick their
habits in the last few years however a
device known as the jewel has broken on
to the scene and while it claims it's
marketed towards adults it has found its
way into the hands of underage users who
have never smoked before I sat down with
some individuals involved with the
newest trend and took a deeper look into
the world behind the nicotine delivery
device that is taking the nation by
storm I spoke with a high school student
who uses the Joule Kyle I'm 17 years old
junior in high school I've been using
the Joule for about six months now it's
very addictive tried to quit
Karen he helped explain what a Joule is
and how it works yes so the Joule so
it's like this is the battery pack this
is what you buy and then you charge it
with magnetic then these other Pods
don't even know what type of juice that
is the pods are not FDA approved which
is bad but oh well it's some type of
juice there's different flavors mints
the popular one mango is also very
popular and so you just plug it in the
light lights up no button vapes have fun
there's no bun you just hit it breathe
in I asked Kyle how many pods he uses in
a day
probably maybe like one or two but if
it's the weekend and you're you have a
fun night you're going out you can
finish a pot it's a couple hours people
friends want to hit it and it's just
going like that and then you're buying
more just like that so I guess on the
weekdays an average one or two weekends
for maybe it's quick and the most he's
ever gone through and one day by himself
three three that's aggressive it was
very aggressive kyle has gone as far as
to give his jewel and name JoEllen Beebe
Sixers basketball player or my favorite
yeah
fits well I asked Kyle if he ever uses
his jewel in school during the day I do
how do you use my jewel sometimes in
class the teacher is writing notes on
board and you just get up real quick and
then bathroom breaks I have you on the
bathroom five kids just passing around
some jewels and other and you just every
time someone walks in you can't even
melt like quick look like make sure it's
like someone cool you know don't want to
get caught at first it was easy because
we charged it right on our laptop you
just use a u.s. plug a USB plug and like
you charge it and teachers won't even
know we just say oh it's like or you go
to USB like it's memory but now like
once teachers know like they're catching
us and case get suspended and yeah it's
bad but probably like two kids this year
well it's not illegal to use tobacco
products under the age of 18 you must be
that age to buy them that forces
underage users like Kyle to find
alternative ways to acquire their pods
I spoke to Hermes a self-described
black-market pod dealer to gain insight
on the world beyond the convenience
store counter well when I first started
out I was maybe only moving like a pack
a day but uh as time goes on it gains
popularity
I'm living hundreds at a time ha you
know man everybody loves this stuff
depending where I'm at I'll be selling
them to anybody from 12 up to 20th
mountain Cali because they have the 21
year old laws over there so people can't
get him as early but uh hey if the price
is right
sometimes I'll move in like seven eight
nine and the demand for jewel pods never
seems to stop I've been selling jewels
for as long as I can remember
[Music]
hey what's up no I mean I'm not busy
how much you need okay I can do that
all right man tell me about 70 I'll meet
you over at X in that in about half an
hour chuckle all right peace
was that a customer say that 70 bucks
seems a little steep fifth-graders am i
right at this point it was clear that
Hermes was pressed for time but we
continued the interview anyway yeah man
like I said I've been sewing as long as
I can remember anyone that ever goes out
to XI to get go BPO that I got him
cleaned out so I can control the market
drive up the price if I can't buy him
anywhere else I get something for
whatever I want
well they usually go about 20 upon 15
for cool Tanna for good friends
despite the inventory that he buys
Hermes made his position on joy usage
very clear huh - I use the jewel nah man
I'm all natural camo blues marble rez I
asked Hermes if he was afraid of getting
caught for what he does no I'm not
worried about getting exposed all my
customers know I like to run a tight
ship keep things down on lock so it's
all good
everyone knows in my high school to go
to Hermes he's just the guy you just go
in line or hit him up and he'll just get
you pods it's easy as that cool guys
very smooth it's not sketchy at all we
just got a tip I'm actually like a
couple bucks and it's easy he makes
money you get pods you just ask him
where do you want to meet Hermes we send
you a destination you just go there it's
pretty smooth it doesn't take long at
all I want to say like I barely see his
face sometimes like he's just always
wearing a hat you know just very
secretive guy but going through Hermes
means that Kyle has to pay a premium I
know in this store they're about like
they range between like 10 to 20 but
because I'm underage I usually pay more
see you around 20 sometimes 25 but like
the more you'd buy and if you buy in
bulk they'll be cheaper so sometimes you
can get it like down to like $10 a pack
but you just gotta know Hermes so it's
about
connections with the added expenses I
asked Kyle if he ever finds himself
scrapping for change to pay for his
habit so all the time quarters you know
you get your piggy bank he's just like
shaking and all the quarters you get
friends you're like all right you want
to throw me and I'll give you one pod
because for pot odds come in a pack so
sometimes we'll split them you know
because like if you are just feeding in
four pods it's bad the jury is still out
on whether or not electronic cigarettes
are safer than smoking but studies so
far have shown promising results to back
up the claims whether you believe
underage dual use is a problem is for
you to decide but it appears that as
long as these devices exist young users
will keep people like Hermes in business

hi friends thanks to the development of
technology today marble can be extracted
and processed without any difficulties
this stone is characterized by a wide
range of applications as a facing
material for different
surfaces therefore researchers are in
constant search of new deposits of
marble and work on improving the method
of its extraction and about all the
details of this case you'll learn from
our video so let's
go at this point each of these
Technologies is in the midst of intense
development to extract marble A
specialized machine must cut a whole
series of channels and slots in the Rock
which can reach 6.5 to 10 ft deep and 59
to 79 ft
long explosions must not be used as
doing so could shatter or crack the
marble and there's no way that this can
be allowed to happen it's only then that
large cranes are brought to the site
which actually extract the marble
blocks
a large toothless Band Saw is used to
cut rough Stone and water and sand is
poured on it while it's working why this
is necessary so that the block is
quickly and relatively easily cut into
pieces of a certain size due to the
friction of the steel blade and Sand by
the way sometimes instead of a rigid
blade Specialists prefer the use of a
wire
saw then what happens the pieces of
marble are moved to a circular grinding
machine and the material itself is
securely strapped down sand and water
are blown directly on the rotating
surface of the machine to level the
surface of the extracted marble
material well and for additional
smoothness the process of grinding is
performed as for the finishing polishing
it's performed with a prepared mixture
of tin oxide and oxalic acid which is
applied to the surface of the marble
with a polishing
wheel then the tra Transportation
process takes place I'd like to point
out that this is a significant stage as
a rule such material is transported by
Rail and containers but there are
exceptions air water and Road are also
welcome but they're much more expensive
in terms of
finances to safely transport the
material from place to place fragile
stone is packed in special crates or a
pyramid two stapled metal posts in
either case the the structure is tightly
secured with straps to prevent the
marble from spoiling from friction with
the belt additional packing material is
laid between them another important
condition is that the transportation of
marble slabs is carried out only in a
vertical
position after the multi-ton blocks of
marble are transported to the
manufacturing plant they're cut into
slabs using digital Milling
machines the marble slabs are then
polished for the first time then with
the help of silica sand pmus Hammers and
chisels the material is
embossed Marble's natural Elegance color
variety and excellent technological
properties make it the ideal material
for creating an exclusive interior today
marble is used in various combinations
for fireplaces bathroom interiors and
flooring I'm not even talking about the
finishing of buildings columns arches
staircases and other architecture
natural
elements but you know even though
Science and Technology do not stand
still the extraction of marble even
today remains a very labor intensive and
costly
work and this is one of the factors that
explain the rather High Cost of the
stone now you can turn your back ho
loader into a giant chainsaw and without
much effort you can do this with a very
unusual attachment from the the Italian
company
danini there may not be many possible
applications for this giant chainsaw in
construction but it looks great this
model is designed to be mounted on a cat
432d backhole loader and is specifically
designed to take full advantage of the
Hydraulics of this particular machine
the saw can be operated right from the
cab and you can control the height and
angle of the saw powerful stuff I must
admit
the kumatu wa800 is a large wheel loader
designed for use in heavyduty mining and
construction applications manufactured
by kumatu a leading producer of heavy
equipment the wa800 is known for its
impressive size and hauling capacity as
well as its Advanced features and
cuttingedge Technology its combination
of size power advanced technology and
operator friendly design make it a
popular choice for Mining and
construction firms around the
world
here we
go the new minia Max saw is a Cutting
Edge and compact power tool that offers
exceptional cutting performance in a
small and portable package this
Innovative saw is designed to meet the
needs of both professional Woodworkers
and DIY enthusiasts who require a
versatile and efficient cutting tool
despite its compact size the minax saw
packs a punch with its powerful motor
and sharp cutting blade it's capable of
making precise and clean cuts through a
variety of materials including wood
plastic and even certain

Metals btech M10 and E10 are fully
mechanized drilling rigs for anchor bolt
installation known for their highquality
anchoring and productivity in mining
operations all of this became possible
thanks to the implementation of
intelligent options in the machines
by the way both models are equipped with
an optional electric transmission with a
zero emission battery which is also
crucial wouldn't you
[Music]
agree to meet the widest possible
technical challenges kemrock has
developed various cutting wheel options
with cutting depths up to 1,000 mm with
different cutting tool configurations
and widths up to 400 MM interestingly
the DMW series is also capable of
working underwater at depths of up to 30
m making this equipment ideal for
trenching and underwater
work meet the walking excavator from
seiku you might be amazed by the size of
this machine but believe me there's
nothing particularly surprising here
thanks to its compact Dimensions the the
excavator excels in its job on extreme
construction sides so this excavator is
truly the best choice for Earthworks on
steep slopes in mountains and on
impassible
surfaces the tesm M5 mechanical trencher
is a powerful and versatile machine
designed for digging trenches in a
variety of soil types and ground
conditions the m 5 is a reliable and
efficient solution for a range of
digging
applications the verir t655 is a
powerful and versatile trencher that is
designed for heavy duty trenching
operations it is equipped with a range
of advanced features that allow it to
cut through even the toughest soils with
ease making it an essential tool for a
variety of construction and agricultural
applications the trener is equipped with
a range of advanced features such as
electronic grade control and a digital
display that's all friends today you've
learned about all the processes of
mining this beautiful material I hope
the information you got was useful to
you we'll be grateful for the like and
subscription to our Channel bye for now

for me what it means to be gender-fluid
is the only word that I understand now
to describe the type of person that I am
which is basically free spirit I never
seen myself as a boy or a girl I kind of
liked it at the mermaid because the
Little Mermaid was like the only person
that I knew who had something different
below the waist but yet was really
pretty we're not in a point of history
right now that we actually fully
understand people
I kind of went through the whole thing
where I accept myself which is like okay
sex change and then I research done
there was a lot of cons with it for
example and you have to quote your body
and get surgery and you know getting
hormone which which could it's possible
they could affect your your whole
personality nude I'm I just personally I
don't believe that I you should have to
change my body or I should have to alter
or get surgery for I feel that I am this
way for a reason and I feel that I
should be able to just be myself
whatever happened to worry about getting
surgery or change so that's why gender
fluidity is the only word that I
understand to define I stay of being
that doesn't trap me into song even way
of being or on one way of thinking in
May 2015
Ireland became the first country to
legalize same-sex marriage on a national
level by popular vote on the surface it
appears that Ireland has progressed in
their acceptance of same-sex
relationships however what we understand
about gender and sex I wanted to gain a
better understanding of the various
gender identities in today's society and
speak to individuals whose biological
sex did not correlate to their gender my
journey began here at the outhouse
transgender support group in Dublin with
its facilitator Sarah Phillips through
so many different terms now to describe
different gender identities it's not
just the stereotypical gay or lesbian
anymore we've got transgender we've got
gender fluid so what do you make of the
new languages that are emerging and I
suppose even within our own community
language is constantly developing you
know young trans people are starting to
redefine the language and you know we've
lived with - binary terms man and woman
for so long I don't think it's as simple
as that
the human race is not just two
gender identities it's very
much a spectrum and I think whatever you
feel comfortable with identifying as I
think for me that's where we should be
ending up being and I think that diverse
nature of our human race is where we
should be going so how would you
describe the word transgender
transgender is an umbrella term for
people who gender identity doesn't agree
with what is necessary on their birth
certificate I've always identified as
female but we did transgender history so
then would you say that you're attracted
to males now
um well the simple answer to that is I
don't think I don't want to be rude but
I don't think I'd be asking the same
question of other people gender identity
and sexual orientation are two different
things just because you have a different
gender identity maybe to your original
birth certificate doesn't mean
necessarily that your sexual orientation
will be one way or the other it is more
about your gender identity in the sense
of your gender identity being different
to what people have identified us I
think I asked what made you choose the
names there I always had Sarah it's
always been with me maybe since
literally since that age of five I
didn't like the name and my within that
kind of class I used to tell the girls
that I played that that's what my name
once it was always it was always for
some reason in my head that's what it
was I then met a transgender woman named
Philippa who has been attending the
support group over the last 10 years she
explained how she made the transition
six years ago for Philippa this meant
legally changing her name having bodily
surgery and committing to a life of
hormones I am the person I was intended
to be basically and what was it that he
didn't like about being a man he wasn't
me I couldn't express myself properly
and anytime I tried to express
himself the way I've felt inside
beginning looks are beginning I realized
I just wasn't happy within myself I had
to I had to show the world who what was
inside and being a man certainly was not
doing that and even saying the word man
just seems so alien to me now for people
who might not have an understanding of
transgender what would you like to put
across and what would you like people to
understand try and put yourself in my
situation I know that it's not something
that I chose to be it's not a choice in
my case it's who I have to be and one of
the things as I transitioned my partner
said when I started going on hormone
treatment when I started going out more
and I started being myself she said to
me you are so much nicer now than you
where I used to be very moody I used to
be very not argumentative but I just was
depressed
whereas now that I am who I was intended
to be I'm so much happier have
compassion have understanding try and
understand what it is to be somebody
like me and how it's not going to affect
you if I choose to exhibit myself as
Philippa and believe me to find somebody
who would accept you and say it say
something kind about you and say I
understand or I'm willing to listen to
you and to listen to you explain explain
your situation that will mean so much to
the
person and what it would mean the world
to them so I think that's the way I've
put it after speaking with both Sarah
and Philippa I felt that I'd gained a
better understanding of the transgender
community
they also made me aware of the fact that
new vocabulary is constantly emerging to
describe other gender identities I then
went on to meet a group of young people
and active members of the LGBT community
I sat in with them for a chat while they
got ready to head off to the Dublin
Pride Parade
same price the only one day a year where
people just get to be themselves and
where they want to wear and do what they
want to deal without people looking at
them and saying why is he dressed like
that why you dressed like that and okay
okay this is my girlfriend
I'm and would you say that you realized
that you're gay yeah I'd say I was kind
of looking at girls since I was 16
oh we're boys and then probably 21 I
started at that yeah wait 18 is present
yeah
when were you ready um I don't know
about grouses about 14 and I only came
in last year so yeah how is that little
terrifying yeah I scared survived into
my life for like what you do it's the
best fate of the entire world best I'm
which is how hot like boyfriend's before
yeah if you work on seven yeah yeah
which I was trying to out probably had a
tree kind of serious boyfriends and I
did love them more like it wasn't a
cause in Oakland to get me just more
friendships than at the elephant yeah
how fast like don't worry asking like
kissing someone that year would you said
that you were attracted to or Mars yeah
yeah I father was like I was attracted
to girls um I thought might be buddy
flexible but then kind of the older I
got then the more I realize that I'm
just not attractive boys anymore on that
way and can didn't want them coming on
to me in clothes and stuff at that and
then it's real either mother for me
anymore
and yeah definitely gay than the speech
I broke up my voice one of four and a
half years like a Jeb
you'll literally a month or four but I
told him that was by like tables it's
relationship okay and then I can show
him six months before we actually fix
your vocal and yeah because we were best
friends
I keep fingers like 15 and 16 and he
just couldn't wrap his hand and head
around like he thought was just a phase
ever so kind of trying to make it work
and I just wouldn't
there you go and that's why he's gay
male and express my soy a very feminine
so if I wake up one morning I want to go
ing to make a crop top I'll do it I have
a cup in the morning
apartment whatever a short shorts and
they would like you know I really don't
like water people's opinion is Alberto
me and never took a dress for myself I
do what I want to do for people of a
problem with it I think that's their
issue you know I can visit me see you
wear makeup hmm yeah
would you wear time and store there's
not much and then a ball point does it
stop trying to would you call up being
feminine then well yeah I characterize
that has been very feminine and like I'm
not kind of wearing a skirt or kind of
going out and getting myself a different
name and acting like that
I'm very much too young and how I choose
expressing my story is me and the blocks
people are open to it but people kinda
don't understand a little bit like whoa
like you're addressing other girls they
want to be a girl oh yeah I want to be
me or expressed I know and maybe you
would identify as transgender no good
for is Jenna flavored I suppose would be
the expression I think what the issue
here is that which is there's two styles
in the world is a more feminine style
more masculine soil we're only
traditionally used to that feminine
style in women intrigued by Luke's
definition of gender fluidity a concept
I was unfamiliar with I decided to meet
with him again
with hopes of gaining a better
understanding of the turn and what it
means to hear so loo care do you stop
identify I identify myself first and
foremost as a human being I think my
character is more important than whether
I'm called he or she obviously were used
to man mikkel T and females being called
she but I have a male body but I feel
that my expression and my nature and my
character is at what we're traditionally
used to in females basically I don't
feel it's a simplest game straight I
think that and we are basically we are
the brain ones on a spectrum and people
like me use a very strong portion of the
feminine side of the brain which is the
right brain and and we are attracted to
the more mature opposite which is more
masculine so I'm feminine so my sexual
orientation will be attracted to a more
masculine person I'm just I think that
is not a simplest rating game amount of
woman I think it's more like like I'm a
male body person and I have a male like
my body but my nature is what we're
traditionally connect with females but
yeah I'm a male and why's that that that
nature and I think the problem is not
being trapped in the wrong body the
problem is we need to begin to recognize
that there is males with that nature
it's not that there are a woman trapped
inside of a man's body it's that they're
a male person with that nature and it
needs to be recognized and we need to
confirm it with it underneath being
aesthetic for and a clothesline through
you're saying earlier you've no
intention of ever actually having
surgery to become a female and not at
the moment no everything changes I could
and just right now very home for my body
and very comfortable and with my
everything about myself I think I was
born this born as I have for a reason I
like to be male but then I don't think I
have to changing it surgery to be myself
is that what would separate you from a
transgender person what did distinct
distinguishes me from my supposed
transgenders one yes I don't have
hormones or surgery but there's plenty
of that people out there who
don't have surgery hormones under still
a woman but I just guess I'm just happy
being me where you call me male or
female and a character is more important
than gender pronoun hey yeah yeah yeah
did you find like people stare too when
you walk into shop sir yeah I get stared
a lot and it's very hurtful because you
know I'm not any different from anyone
else I just happened to be male who you
know has an effeminate oh yeah I just
think people should just start to be
themselves a bit more and just do what
they want to do and take questions like
yeah I like sailing you know there you
go again you should get that in the
camera though there you go
that's a man like you should get a to
the camera okay the guys the guys just
said there that's a my daddy idea no if
you want to kind of get them in the car
I prefer to wear to use dollar more -
you might like I haven't made a body so
I like to wear teens that suit my figure
you often find it hard to like find
stuff that fits or even like shoes and
stuff like that oh definitely I find it
very difficult and that's why a lot of
times I design my own clothes it's kind
of the thing where you say okay it
doesn't exist but necessity is the
mother of invention so I'm gonna make it
myself
shields are very hard to find in a size
9 there's no actually she was it's a
it's a problem with the whole gender
thing again they don't care for clothes
for people like me and that's something
- sorry it as well I couldn't help but
feel a little disheartened by the
reaction of the two mentors Luke earlier
that day I wanted to learn more about
the support he receives from those
closest from and how he deals with
negative comments
so who would you've went to if you
needed support or advice well and to so
many people that gave me like supporter
is but then again not too many but the
main supporter was my mom
she was my main supporter she supported
me through the mean years and to the
lean years and she was unconditional
where support were everything so yeah my
mom was my biggest supporter and then
she passed away two months ago and she
her death was like the probably the most
traumatizing thing that ever happened to
me but um you know I just it's made me
stronger if anything it's made me
realize that life is very very short and
the people that love you unconditionally
can go like that so be be be yourself so
what can you change are you hoping for
in the future
hope for the future that so many people
are going to begin to realize that it's
not going to be the end of the world
when people start to be themselves and
people are just going to be consistent
in their love and energy and you know
people are just going to be more open
and just loveable and and you know we
begin to see a really exciting
revolution because we start to see all
these people coming out woodwork who've
never seen before coming out was
gender-fluid her or lesbian or or you
know or androgynous sir our heterosexual
with an inclination towards feminine man
it's crazy so we're going to see all
these delivery colors the spectrum
shining through I know your positive
attitude you have to have a positive
attitude because you know you have one
shot at this and if you don't enjoy it
then you don't you know you might you're
just wasting your time so we just have
fun best yeah but I just feel better
when her for anyway so who doesn't so
having looked under the surface I feel
on one level relieved that people feel
free to express themselves and that
society's acceptance of those born
outside of what we used to consider the
norm is certainly increasing
however at another level I feel a degree
of empathy with those individuals
because clearly they still feel that
society still alienates them thus I
believe that there is a need for a new
dialogue and language around the whole
subject of gender identity this is our
contribution to expanding that narrative
you

-Henry?
Hi
-What happened? 
-Can I get you something to drink?
-Some water would be nice
-Sure
Have a seat
-Olivia, right? Yeah yeah we met at
the um at a bar last night
-Henry I just want to say congratulations
You have been selected for a 
very exciting business opportunity
-Okay uh no offense sorry
I fell asleep on your floor 
but I'm just gonna
I'm not really interested in 
what ever that is so
Hey where is the um
-Henry 
-Hmm
-Why don't you come here
Henry you've been selected to represent
your species in what is almost certainly
the biggest trade agreement in the
history of your planet
-My planet?
-Gotta show you something real quick
-Sorry I'm gonna
Sorry
-Don't be
Disgust is a very very common reaction 
I try not to take it personally
-Oh that's you?
-We find on contact that species are more
 comfortable negotiating with a representative that
looks and speaks just like them
So. My client is looking 
to make an acquisition
A very big one and we would love it if
you helped broker the deal
-And what are your clients looking to acquire?
-Your oceans
-Oceans
-Yeah
-Our oceans are not for sale
-I'm confident we'll get to a YES on this
-Why is that?
-Well I do hate this part but
under the terms of the treaty governing
this region
we're first bound to conduct a good
faith negotiation with a qualified
representative of the affected species
-So I'm the qualified- 
and this is the good faith negotiation?
-Exactly.  Thing is if talks break down 
in the treaty we
do have the right to begin expropriation
proceedings
-Ex-pro.. what is that?
You're just gonna take it?
-Between us you're much better off just making a deal
with my client 
-This isn't a negotiation at all this is this is extortion
-In the long run we feel everyone benefits from an open and a fair trade policy
-We don't benefit. We
don't benefit.  We're gonna die
-Also we have five minutes left 
-What?
-That'll cover the remaining time allotted in the treaty for the good-faith negotiation
-No, what? This? No. 
What do you mean, the whole thing?
-Every species experience is the flow of
time differently so when we drew up the
treaty everyone agreed this was like a
pretty reasonable amount
-I can't do this
-Why don't we talk terms 
-No no
-I understand your species 
-No no listen I do traffic tickets
You should be talking to the head of the UN or some big corporate...
I'm not the greatest lawyer in the world
why would you pick me?
-We'd love to take possession immediately
My clients aren't currently local to this system 
but we do have a
small wormhole we can just...
-Oh Jesus
-...send the assets right through and we're happy to dispose
of any sea life that we find...
-I get it
....Or return it up to you
-You didn't pick me because I'm a good lawyer 
you just had to pick someone
I bet your little treaty there
doesn't say who you have to pick exactly
just as long as they're qualified
-There were a lot of variables that went into this 
lots of moving parts
-You stacked the deck
-It's only good business to take
advantage where we can
-You know on your bad days you think 
'I'm the worst I'm the worst at my job'
In the back of your head you're like 
'that can't be true like statistically
speaking that can't actually be true
there has to be somebody worse out there'
-Henry
Can I offer you a drink?
With alcohol
You like rum and cokes don't you
-Cuba Libre?
It's like the same thing only with lime in it
-Here you go
Thanks
-So we understand that your personal
survivability post-acquisition is a
sticking point and I shouldn't be doing
this but
I'm gonna offer you something very special
-Yeah?
-We have a couple very lovely extra planetary habitats that are floating around that we're just not using what's
-What's that? Extra planetary..
Is that like a Space Station?
-Yeah and they could easily be retrofitted for
your species needs and frankly desires. 
 We could give you one the size of a small city
You could bring a couple thousand
people with you
-And I wouldn't..Would I have to tell them what happened?
-You could tell them whatever you want
-So I could tell them I saved them.  
That I swooped in last minute
-You would be a hero.
Henry let's do this
I'm excited for you 
Don't you want to win for once?
-I win sometimes well
most of the time it's when the cop
doesn't bother to show up
-Well we only have a few minutes left 
-Wouldn't be in business if it wasn't for the no-shows
-A wins a win
-Is it?
-We actually have a lot of paperwork to get through before we can
-I'm just gonna take a look at this real quick
Yeah here we go statute concerning the
appropriation of assets this deal
-This deal expires in 60 seconds
-The expropriating party will have the
The expropriating party will have the right to commence a formal hearing in the jurisdiction of
the opposing party...in the jurisdiction
of the opposing party that's
So that means that your clients 
actually have to appear here today
to begin the negotiations
-Well that's a minor detail
-And you said they were not local to this
system is that correct?
-Yes
-And so if I agreed you would just
use your wormhole dealies and you would suck up all the oceans and that would be that
-By the end of the day yes

Nobody sees my true form without being
utterly repulsed it's humiliating
-I wasn't repulsed
It was just scary
-Well, you haven't had a win in so long
Why do you think I'm on water duty? 
Trust me there are better gigs out there
-Believe me I've been there
Look I know you almost just 
destroyed all life on my planet but

You can fax me. They work quite
well over cosmic distances
And Henry?
If it's okay with you I...
I might just take you up on that talk

7:15 and the Frankish Kingdom is
embroiled in a civil war it's quite
complicated but to summarize it was a
civil war not between men fighting for
the crown but for men fighting for the
title of mayor of the palace who was in
charge of the Kings household in Frankia
the King was basically a puppet to
whoever held this position and so people
wanted it there was supposed to be two
mayors one for Austrasia which was
hereditary and another for nutria there
was an attempt to merge both mayor
Alice's by giving them both to an
eight-year-old and revolt a man named
Charles Martel seize the opportunity
that the chaos brought her managed to
defeat his enemies in 718 Charles was
given the title Duke of the franks by
King Chilperic the second who again
didn't have any real power Chilperic
died in 720 and was replaced by Theodore
rich the fourth who Charles had
appointed Charles saw to increasing the
size of the kingdom and by 730 it had
expanded to this with Charles conquering
many of the german-speaking people's to
the east to the west and the south
though things weren't so rosy the Duchy
of Aquitaine had previously been part of
the Frankish Kingdom but had broken away
in the Civil War and was now having
trouble with their shared southern
neighbor this southern neighbor was the
Umayyad Caliphate which was at this
point the largest and wealthiest Empire
ever assembled the Caliphate after
numerous attempts has started to conquer
Aquitaine forcing its Duke Otto to ask
Charles for assistance he granted it in
return for Aquitaine submission and
Charles mobilised his army and met the
caliphates here at the famous Battle of
Tours sometimes called the Battle of
poitiers it was a decisive Frankish
victory and was thus cemented forever as
one of the most famous battles in
history the exact importance of the
battle is fiercely debated with opinions
ranging from it merely halting further
raiding to saving Christianity and
Western Europe anyway the Caliphate
would try again in the following years
but failed and my 740 ceased to be an
existential threat to Frankie er so in
737 King Theodore rich the fourth had
died and Charles decided he didn't need
to appoint another king and so he didn't
he didn't take the crown for himself
though and still ruled as mayor until
his death in 741 before his death the
territories of the kingdom had been
split between his sons carlomon and
Pippin in 743 they're both chosen new
King childress the third but as expected
he had no authority the first half a
decade of their joint rules or several
revolts in the east and some clashes in
the south but it was largely stable in
747 carlomon renounced his title and
became a monk leaving Pippin as the sole
ruler by 751 Pippin didn't really see
the point of childerik remaining on the
throne and so with the consent of Pope
Zachary got rid of him he proclaimed
himself King Pippin the third the fur
of the new Carolingian dynasty named
after his father Pippin was an
accomplished general and leader but not
as much as his father or his son and so
he isn't very well remembered he did
importantly begin the close relationship
between the Frankish Kings and the
Pope's Pippin lacked legitimacy which he
could gain from the Pope who in return
would gain Frankish protection from the
lombards Pippin aided Rome against the
lombard kingdom several times and carved
out these territories for the Pope to
govern personally the papal States
Pippin reigned until 768 when he died he
divided the kingdom between his two sons
Charlemagne the eldest and carlomon
Charlemagne's name comes from the Latin
careless Magnus meaning Charles the
great
so Charlemagne and his brother didn't
like each other but fortunately this
wouldn't be a problem for long since in
771 column and found himself slightly
dead as such Charlemagne gained the rest
of the kingdom beginning his
transformative sole rule Charlemagne's
first priority was war an expansion over
the course of his reign Charlemagne went
to war with pretty much everyone but the
reasons for these Wars weren't
exclusively territorial but also
religious to the northeast of the
kingdom of the Saxons who were pagans
and had raided the kingdom for centuries
in 772 Charlemagne noticed a raid to
destroy the sacred Saxon tree could aim
insel beginning decades of warfare and
forced conversions in the region 773 saw
conflict between the kingdom of the
Lombards and the Pope and Charlemagne
who wanted to maintain this prestigious
relationship between the Franks and the
papers he came to the Pope's aid it was
a quick war in the lombards were
defeated the next year when Charlemagne
captured its capital pavia he thereafter
proclaimed himself as the king of the
Lombards but did keep the territory
separate from Frankie a proper he also
conquered the Duchy of Spoleto and gave
some authority over it to the Pope the
war with the Saxons continued as a
grindingly slow pace until they rallied
behind a man could video Kent
Charlemagne was unhappy with this and so
in 782 he ordered the execution of over
4,000 Saxon prisoners and in 785 widok
and accepted baptism the decades
following this saw a major expansion of
the kingdom starting in 787 with the
subjugation of Benevento here the next
year the kingdom expanded further east
with the integration of bavaria and the
conquest of Carinthia which brought the
franks into contact with the very
wealthy Avars it wasn't long before war
broke out between the two and the franks
led by Charlemagne son Pippin invaded
the Ava's had lost by 796 in their royal
residents called the ring was sacked
immediately after this sha'lame
subjugated Croatia in these areas the
next year sha'lame finished subjugating
the Saxon so we could finally tick that
off in 799 he did the same to the
Breton's thus making
nicer to look at and he also conquered
Barcelona thus on the cusp of the Year
800 the kingdom looked like this and
it's no wonder that is sometimes
referred to as the Carolingian Empire
running this massive Kingdom required
ever more complex and capable methods of
administration the running of the
kingdom revolved around the royal court
which regularly moved around the Empire
to various royal palaces the most
notable being here at Aachen arkem was
not as is often believed the capital of
the kingdom but was an extremely
important city in terms of
administration and religious reform as
well as being Charlemagne's favored
residence the kingdom was divided into
counties and miss Attica which were
administrative districts they were often
inspected by Charlemagne's emissaries
called the Missy Dominica which is Latin
for n voice of the Lord the Lord in this
case being Charlemagne and not you know
God the Missy were made up of two
officials one ecclesiastical often a
bishop and one secular often account who
would make sure the Kings Authority
remained intact and would report back on
any potential issues the church was
extremely important to maintaining order
and running the kingdom bishops and
learners men of the church had very
prestigious positions at court and
Charlemagne who was a very pious man to
a great interest in church reform in
order to push through reforms
Charlemagne with issue capitularies
which were edicts enforcing changes to
church practices the most famous of
these capitularies was the admin ETO
generalís which basically dictated the
rules for the everyday lives of
Charlemagne subjects and standardized
Church practices it decreed that the
Christian nature of the kingdom was
immutable and that there was to be a
kingdom wide revival of learning which
we will get to in a minute the Year 800
saw the most famous event of
Charlemagne's reign when he went to Rome
after Pope Leo the 3rd had fled to him
because some of his enemies had tried to
blind him Charlemagne went back to Rome
with him to sort things out which he did
and whilst he was there Leo the 3rd
crowned him in pirata romanum or the
Roman Emperor Charlemagne thus became
the first emperor in the West since the
fall of Roma for 3 centuries prior this
title didn't really do much except grant
a bunch of prestige and wind up those in
they're still very much alive Eastern
Roman Empire the eastern empire often
called the Byzantine Empire was at this
point being run by a woman Irene who had
fallen out with the papacy and so
instead of patching things up they
simply picked a new Emperor the big
debate surrounding Charlemagne's
coronation hinges on whether or not he
was the first Holy Roman Emperor or if
it was also the first in 962 those
living at the time saw no difference
between the title bestowed on
Charlemagne or Otto the first and the
distinction exists in the mind of
historians only who like to categorize
things in fact the title Racine is no
different to the one bestowed on
Augustus so
previously stated Charlemagne wanted to
ensure that learning was revived in his
kingdom and so he oversaw a period known
as the Carolingian Renaissance the
reason for this much like Charlemagne's
conquests were religious since it was
believed that you couldn't be a good
Christian until you knew what a good
Christian was it was seen as the duty of
rulers to oversee the salvation of this
subject Souls and so the exercise of
power had to be combined with greater
knowledge a concept known as correct EO
from across Europe he sponsored scholars
to come to his court such as au kawin
from Northumbria pulled the Deacon from
the old lombard kingdom and Einhard
a frank ein Hart who was close to
Charlemagne wrote the life of Charles
the Great which is one of the major
sources about his reign schools were
founded across the kingdom the most
notable being Metz wasan and st. gall
and greater emphasis was given to
learning the curriculum was standardized
literacy rates amongst the nobility
improved in a new means of writing was
created Carolingian minuscule this would
see the implementation of many
grammatical conventions such as
introducing lowercase letters question
marks and standardizing letter forms all
of this led to a massive increase in the
number of texts produce and a
strengthening of the church whose
literacy rate made it indispensable to
leaders Charlemagne undertook much of
this learning himself and there is a
common belief that he was illiterate he
probably wasn't but there is an
overwhelming evidence either way he
didn't learn Latin which was an official
administrative language until his later
life there were nine hurt claim that he
could speak and read Greek but the truth
of that is less clear so now that
Charlemagne was an emperor who performed
his empire and conquered most of his
neighbors there was only one thing left
to do conquer more neighbors in 805
after some raiding Charlemagne took his
forces to these and subjugated all of
these people notably the Bohemians in
the south there were some more conflicts
with the Muslims and by a 12th the
franks had expanded to here the only
power in europe the catalan Charlamagne
now was the eastern roman empire which
held this territory most notably venice
in 812 Charlemagne won a diplomatic
victory when the Byzantines recognized
him as the legitimate Emperor in the
West which might have had something to
do with the fact that he had Nami just
outside of Venice whilst the size of the
Frankish Kingdom may have dissuaded
aggression by the Byzantines it didn't
deter the Danes pretty much immediately
after Frankie's borders had expanded to
reach Denmark's rating had begun up and
down the coast these raids were pretty
devastating but ultimately were nothing
compared to what Charlemagne successors
would have to endure Charlemagne's 47
year reign would come to an end when he
died in 814 his eldest son Pippin had
died in 811 and so he had only one
son left Louie better known as Louis the
pious his reign was somewhat less
successful than his father's though and
he ended up dividing the kingdom up
between his sons which led to the rise
of two major states in the West the
kingdom of France and in the east the
Holy Roman Empire
so Charlemagne is remembered as many
things a conqueror a patron of scholars
as a reformer and as a protector of the
church after his grandsons divided the
Empire between them Charlemagne was
considered the father figure of the new
States which came out of it much of his
reign was driven by his desire to be a
great Christian King he believed it was
his duty to subjugate the surrounding
areas and force conversions within them
in order to save the souls of those who
lived there it is important to remember
that much of his great legacy was built
upon the work of his forebears Pippin
and Charles Martel without whom there
may not have been a Frank here at all
one thing is almost universally agreed
upon though Charles most certainly
deserve to be remembered as the great I

the Block was assassinated on the
streets of Chicago this killer 17 year
old Jakira Barnes AKA K.I a member of
the Rival Street 63rd who was known as
the deadliest hitter on her block K.I
took out OD Perry as a retaliation for

Tuka Gregory who was taken out by Odie
Perry the year 2010 marked the beginning
of the unending gang wars between 63rd
and 64th Street that have claimed
hundreds of lives in the past decade and

who lived on 64th Street decided to be a
member of the Gangster Disciples on the
63rd block the ride Rivals to the 64th

revealed that wooski was encouraged to
join the Black Disciples The Gang That
was present where he lived the wooski
refused we'll see how you coming
back though
no no it's okay okay
stay angry with
a bit like that because I thought he
read the meetings

day when wooski pulled the trigger on a
member of the Black Disciples crazy

[Music]
camera system
at about 6 45 pm on January 12 2011.
just a few months after the gang wars
began 13 year old John Dale Gregory Tuka
and the last member of the Gangster
Disciples on 63rd Street was
assassinated at a bus stop where he
stood it was believed that OD Perry
carried out this attack on tuka's life
what's up so I am in Inglewood
on the corner of St Lawrence and 63rd
Street I'm at the bus stop we're on
January 12 2011. a young man by the name
of Shondell Gregory better known on the
street as Tuka a member of the Gangster
Disciples was shot and killed
he was standing at this very bus stop uh
when uh some enemies came up and just uh
shot him I believe he died on the way to
the hospital according to police reports
Tuka and two other people were waiting
for a westbound 63rd Street bus when the
gunman walked up and asked everyone if
another bus was coming he didn't walk
behind the bus shelter for the silver
handgun and pulled the trigger at Tuka
took a stagger to a nearby trash can
after the first hit but that didn't stop
Odie from firing at him he hit him three
more times in the back before leaving
Tuka who passed away on the scene
foreign
assassination a series of Revenge
killings happened between the two blocks
until Jakira Barnes took out ODI Perry
the young man responsible for tuka's
passing at about 11 30 on August 10 2011
the day which happened to be tuka's
posthumous birthday Jakira Barnes
allegedly took out OD Perry near the
parkway Gardens Homes at 64th Street
after he sustained the gun wound to the
neck yeah
and watch a user boy he was not with it
it's on two good boy Yo which is a lame
boy what did you come from boy that was
the goofy tomorrow some Christmas I love
Chris boy and the Jeep
bad boy
all throughout 63rd Street okay I was
praised for assassinating Odie Perry but
while they celebrated Odie Perry's
passing was heartbreaking for the Black
Disciples on 64th Street in the bid to
honor holy Berry as their fallen
disciple the parkway Gardens on 64th
Street was named oblach after Odie Perry
she was also seen as quote quote a
killer of many people but she was also
linked to the death of OD if you don't
know OD got killed and that's how old
block was formed although OD Perry's
passing was a victory for 63rd Street it
didn't take long before their most
feared assassin Chicago Barnes was taken
out by the man who has now come to be
known as the ghost of all black king Von
he liked her as a girlfriend yeah he
wanted to be her boyfriend she just felt
like he was trying to set her up and
kill her that's what she told me she's
like I think he's just trying to kill me
he don't like me what's the light it
wasn't long before jakira's death at
about 3 30 pm on April 11 2014 a series
of gang attacks happened across Chicago
which caused the life of 36 people on
the Fateful night one of the people who
passed away was 17 year old Shakira
Barnes who suffered approximately nine
gun wounds before she passed Jakira
Barnes died last month in April she was
17 years old she was killed in the
Woodlawn neighborhood in a shooting and
she was shot multiple times and so the
police thought that she was targeted
that she was assassinated essentially
years after Chicago was assassinated the
police authorities released court
documents that King Vaughn was in fact
the person who pulled the trigger on
that fateful evening on April 11 2014.
but for whatever reason it never made it
to court okay but if you read the actual
document that came up in this Freedom of
Information Act uh uncovered it
basically says that hey the purse who
allegedly killed her was Davon Bennett
AKA King Von the deadliest shooter on no
block the black's most feared gangster
and Grandson are some of the names that
have been used to refer to the rapper
King Von growing up on the streets of
oblach King Vine wasn't like every other
regular gangster he had a pretty decent
childhood and didn't have a lot of money
problems it was decent for me I like
Olympic like that it was regular for me
like you know because I grew up on this
but when I look at other people so I'm
moving around I I see how other people
run up on how they like it like so it'd
probably be hard for them it ain't the
same as I see everybody else but to me
it's regular my mom was there you know
no Daddy step daddy or something
you know regularly going to school
ain't a lot of money but you know still
got love shoes and clothes man ain't too
much but all that changed after King
Vine lost his father to gang violence at
11. in no time King Vine found himself
dabbling in different criminal gang
activities
me when I went I got in trouble early 15
years old like that's all I ain't never
been grown until like right now because
I've been in jail all the times were
really kind of like you know like Angry
to graduate high school
all that so one of the time for me to
step up I was already in jail I was
already in trouble
Street activity
at only 16 years old in 2010 King Vine
was arrested for the first time when
Robert recharges in Chicago the rapper
who was only a teenager then was taken
to juvenile boot camp after his arrest
but he had the charges against him
dropped but that was only the beginning
of the lengthy criminal record that I
waited the rapper in his future life
they locked me out for a robbery armed
robbery on contact this is something you
were able to beat back then right they
dropped the charge they dropped most of
them in game let me go for boot camp
obviously you know to even know what's
going on I just want to get out of jail
get out
but that was your first run yeah that
was the first you've had other run-ins
since then yeah yeah what were some of
the other things you ended up getting in
trouble for
um by 2012 King bonds arrested charges
toppled and he found himself locked up
for unlawful firearm possession on
November 21st 2012 King Vine who had
just turned 18 was arrested as an adult
with a bond set at 75 000 King Biden
continued to get in trouble until he
caught his biggest charge after taking
out Malcolm Stuckey during a gang hit in
2014. on May 29th 2014 King Bond was at
a party at 5722 South LaSalle Street a
two-story house divided into three
Apartments situated a couple of blocks
east of Interstate 94. this location was
only three miles straight west of the
Museum of Science and Industry where a
certain Malcolm Stuckey work Stuckey had
also been invited to this party for King
Von alongside other members of the Black
Disciples was in attendance according to
the hosts of the party laminda Jones
King Vine who had been there long before
Stucky arrived and started trouble with
some rival gang members who he met at
the party
Avon came to my son's birthday party on
that day I knew how he moved we all know
how these kids on these streets move but
we parents can't really do anything but
when I saw him stand down the kids from
the other block said to him don't start
no mess in my house and he laughed as he
said to me I'm not on that after saying
that to me he smiled and left the party
I didn't even know when he returned oh
hell it broke loose after King Vine
returned to the party as he showed up
with a Smith and Wesson just as king
Bond returned Malcolm Stucky drove into
the location in the burgundy Pontiac
Grand Prix and this was where his fate
crossed with the ghost of oblach King
Vine and his associate microwave showed
up at a basketball court just across the
street from the party or Stucky and some
partygoers were playing a game before
returning to the house to eat the food
lamita Jones Was preparing Court playing
a game of b-ball when two men pulled up
from the alley behind the house it all
happened in a Flash you know Malcolm
just stepped aside to smoke a cigar and
the next we heard was the rivals spotted
at the party earlier saw him first and
decided to open fire on him and Michael
Wade Von open fire on his rival and
chased him down the south street where
the party was going on and the crowd saw
what had gone down at the time King Von
and Wade realized what happened Stucky
had been Gravely wounded in the
crossfire and another man had been
injured in the foot Stuckey passed away
on the Spot while still dressed in his
work uniform it was the murder of
Malcolm Stuckey that landed King bond in

Rapper Lil Durk took him under his wings
to help him build a rap career being
under little Dirk King Vine began to
make a name for himself by telling his

he was taken out on that faithful night
of November 6 2020. on the tragic night
of November 6 2020 King Vine went out
partying at the Monaco hookah lounge in
Atlanta when the fight broke out between
his group an Affiliates a rapper NBA
young boy including condo Rondo and
Little Tim according to anxiety
resources King Vine had picked a fight
with NBA young boys Affiliates because
of the competition between the rappers
fabric was caught in a fight with cuando
Rondo and his associates but no one
really knows how things got really bad
that led to King Bond's assassination
not even Robert guando Rondo who was
directly involved while narrating the
events of that fateful night cuando
Rondo said my brother said no Tim told
me lil bro I'm not about to let you sit
in no car and go to sleep cuando
explains I'm about to sit in here and
roll up but the two brothers had no idea
how the night was going to play out for
them The Insider sources believed that
King Vine only attacked the 4kt guys
because of their affiliation with the
rapper NBA youngboy an interview of King
Vine barely 24 hours before he was
assassinated was proof that the rapper
did in fact have issues with NBA young
boy on November 5th 2020 just the day
before the tragic passing of King van he
sat for an interview with DJ academics
where he revealed the true status of his
relationship with 4K trade rapper NBA
young boy although King Von he didn't
have any issues with NBA young boy he
also said that there are issues would
only relate to women and internet
speculation among their fans people told
me people told me you and young boy was

(somber music)
- I was 24, I had a
good job, I'd moved out.
I was quite happy.
Um.
And then what? (laughs)
(upbeat music)
- It is a strange thing,
the memory.
You try to gain experiences in life
and your memories is how you recall them,
and to me, that's everything,
but obviously you can
survive without remembering,
because Clair does.
♪ She was a shark smile ♪
♪ In a yellow van ♪
♪ She came around and I stole her glance ♪
- I have a page a day.
I have to tick off when I've eaten.
I tick off when I've showered,
'cause I don't remember.
I somehow still learned piano,
so when I've practiced, I'll tick it off
'cause I don't remember if I've done that.
- Clair lives in a three
minute period, that's her life.
And it continues along
the next three minutes.
If you ever seen the
film "50 First Dates",
when I watched that,
well, it was quite emotional.
It's very much like Clair.
- To me, it's random.
Just goes.
(music ends)
- [Interviewer] What happened?
- I thankfully don't remember.
(eerie music)
- I get a phone call, he said
"You need to get here quick."
Well I've never driven to fast
for here Woolwich in my life.
(moving music)
Saw Clair and she's in an isolated room,
but she was conscious and
talking and sitting up in bed
and she kept looking at
this calendar on the wall
and saying "Is it January?"
And we said, "Yes."
She said, "Well, what
happened to Christmas?"
- I've been told,
I think my flatmate couldn't
wake me or something,
and I end up in hospital and told
I didn't know who my parents
were, when I was in hospital.
- That was the worst time of my life.
I just couldn't believe
she didn't know who I was.
- Well, and I don't understand
how I could forget them,
but I didn't really know
anything in hospital, apparently.
Took time.
- Do your count again,
your count down from 20.
And see how well you can remember.
- 20, 19
and 18
and 17
15
11
11
Oh yeah, 15, 11 she kept saying.
11,
5.
What was I on?
- Five.
- What I was saying.
I went 15, 11.
Wait, what am I saying.
- It was the only thing
I could think asking her,
I dunno, it's a test,
designed in Scotland.
After we've left hospital where
the occupational therapist said
that you actually need
your short-term memory
to get information into
your long-term memory,
because Clair's is so small.
She hasn't got enough to process anything,
even just lifting your arm and eating,
you need that memory for that.
So she can't get the information
into a long-term memory
because she hasn't gotten enough of it.
(uplifting music)
- So it's four years worth.
It's been about that long.
I write down what I've done,
because if I don't write that down,
I won't remember a bit
later on what I've done.
(pencil scribbling)
Then if I need to do something,
I've got column because I won't remember
if I need to do something,
so I'll write it in there.
I do remember thinking,
what this is just silly.
Why do I want a diary?
I think I used to be a
bit embarrassed by it,
but I don't want to be without
it now, it is my memory.
(music builds)
- There needs to be repetitive.
That's the only way she can learn.
Harry, our dog, she just called
it the dog for two months.
It took her that long to
remember the name, Harry.
- Yes, stopping med, I've got that in big
at the top to remind me.
After spending a long time
trying to remember them,
I then had to remember I didn't
need to take them. (laughs)
I think when it was my birthday,
probably took a few weeks
for me to remember I was 29.
I say I've stopped aging though. (laughs)
So I'm happy that, don't want to get old.
So I've stopped aging. (laughs)
I've got diary and I
have a white board out.
This tells me what I'm doing
so I can just think, oh.
- It took her a long
time to learn a routine.
But now it's in her brain that's it,
it's got into the hard drive,
and it doesn't flick off when
she goes to sleep. (laughs)
Why you taking two?
- [Clair] One's got
the photos and lengths.
- [Mark] Ah.
- Right, I'm ready.
I've forgot, what have I forgotten?
We'll find out.
(inspirational music)
When I meet new people, if
I'm gonna meet them again,
I'll definitely warn them,
I might not remember much.
When I began to help
out in the charity shop,
I asked them for a photo.
I've got a page in the diary,
photos and names underneath that I check.
- She's been working here
over three years now.
I had keep telling her over and
over again in the beginning,
but most of the time
she gets it right now.
Do you remember when you first came in,
you couldn't find where to
put your bag or your coat?
- I don't remember that.
- Yeah, it took about six months,
but you managed it.
(Clair laughs)
Do you remember what my name is now?
- [Clair] Sue?
- No, It begins with an R.
- [Clair] Rachel!
- Correct!
- [Clair] Why did I say Sue?
(Rachel laughs)
- Wicked
- I can recognize people,
but I can't do names.
(moving music)
- Always your father's dreams,
always thinking about taking
your daughter down the aisle
and up until 2014, that was
always what was gonna happen.
- I was seeing someone,
but I don't remember them,
but I think they were nice
and tried, but I don't.
- Well, I'd love to think
that Clair's gonna meet someone again,
but she wouldn't remember
if she did meet somebody.
It takes something very special
because it is hard work,
without a doubt.
- Someone I remember
would be nice. (laughs)
- You feel sometimes,
is it worth talking to her because
she's not gonna know that
you've said something,
but it's silly, 'cause
in that three minutes,
she's a normal person
understanding what you're saying.
Good thing is if I get a new joke,
I do try it out on or
every day, different ways.
And I find out which one's
the best way of saying it.
(Mark laughs)
I often wondered if we took her somewhere
and she went to the toilet,
if a completely separate
lot of people that she knows
was to sit somewhere in the room,
would you go and sit
there and not realize it.
- It's different.
- Yeah.
- Dunno.
- Might try it on you. (laughs)
- Do it.
Try it.
- You'll just go sit
down with them instead.
Would you go with them.
- Good parts about bad memory,
I have a bad day, I can forget.
Don't write it down, I've forgotten.
And it helps. (laughs)
- Clair's always happy,
that's something that I find very strange.
I've never, ever seen her
upset since the injury at all.
- I feel quite lucky now,
I can't really complain.
- She knows she's not right,
there's something wrong,
but she doesn't worry about it because,
it's three minutes later,
she's forgotten about worrying about it.
- I think I'm getting along a lot better
and finding it a bit easier
and understand it a bit
more, which definitely helps.
- It's a strange thing, the memory,
and when it goes, it goes.

[Music]
having a hard time understanding the
difference between os and oc are you
unsure about what a parenthetical is or
what a slug line is then this video is
for you hello lovely people my name is
mikayla lizac welcome to my channel or
welcome back to my channel if you're new
here
hey
what
today i'm going to be showing you all
the different elements of a film script
i totally understand film language is
definitely foreign to a lot of new
people who are in the industry and if
you're a new actor or new writer you
might need a little bit of help so i'm
going to show you guys all the different
terms and the lingo used within film
scripts if you don't already know who i
am hi again i already said my name my
name is michaela lizac i'm a
professional actress of nine years imdb
resume in the description and i help
aspiring actors and filmmakers try and
break into the film and television
industry hit subscribe so i can help you
navigate your career or maybe you can
just follow me on mine we are like a
family here we help each other out help
each other try and be successful without
further ado let's get right on into the
video
i think it's pretty fitting that we
start out with what starts a scene and
that would be the slug line or a scene
header a slug line or scene header
establishes the time and the setting for
your reader or for the production at the
start of your slug line you're usually
going to see three letters and it can
either be int or ext but what do these
mean int stands for interior and ext
stands for exterior sometimes you can
also see i dash e and this means both
interior and exterior the reason we use
interior and exterior is so that we're
specific about our setting we're
specific about our setting guys take for
example if your scene just says coffee
house day and there's no interior or
exterior this will definitely cause some
confusion for everybody in the
production having something inside
versus outside for production changes
everything set dressers and lighting and
sound they all have to adjust to being
outside or inside so it's very important
to be specific and it all starts with
interior or exterior after interior or
exterior you're going to have your
setting which is where your scene takes
place this could be as intimate as a
coffee house or a bedroom to something
way bigger like an airport or space
space and sometimes in your slug lines
it can go from a larger area to a
smaller area for example you can put
exterior beach towel bar day so it just
makes things a little more specific
after you're setting you're going to
want to specify time so you're going to
specify whether your scene takes place
in the day or at night or
later or moments later or it's
continuous from another scene to that
current scene and sometimes creative
liberties are taken with slug lines for
example if you have a setting that it's
not really clear what time it is or if
it's inside or outside for example a
dark abyss instead of putting like
interior dark abyss day you can just put
dark abyss and then go into your action
line slug lines can be
very practical and they can be a little
more artistic it just depends on what
type of film you're writing and what
tone you want to convey in your script i
think slug lines are pretty fun and if
you agree give this video a thumbs up
thank you for the thumbs up
if you didn't slugline is very offended
he'll find you in your sleep
interior viewers bedroom night slug line
creeps up to your name lying in bed fast
asleep
holding a knife
don't let that be you
don't let that be you
after our slug lines we have our action
lines those are right down below them
slug lines action lines are pretty
self-explanatory and they're very
important they give the reader and the
production more detail about the scene
what's going on let me pull up one of
the scenes i have written so this is
what you can usually expect from an
action line interior apartment bathroom
night an attractive young woman stacey
20s checks her appearance in a bathroom
mirror she fluffs out her blonde curls
and adjusts the straps of a sexy blue
dress
over here where it says stacy her name
is in all caps why is it in all caps
miss girl you're not gonna put your
character name in all caps all the time
you just capitalize your character's
name when they're first introduced to
the audience or first introduced in your
script right beside that in parentheses
you'll see a little 20s it just gives a
little more description about like the
character or whatever and also within
your action lines if there's a prop
that's very specific or important you
will also put that in all caps or maybe
sometimes sounds like if there's a knock
knock knock it's gonna be in all caps
usually it doesn't have to it can be
italicized again style she looks at a
knife it would be in all caps when
certain elements are important to the
story or they want emphasis a writer
will stylistically make the choice to
capitalize it after action lines we have
our dialogue breaks
dialogue now when it comes to formatting
dialogue within a script you're usually
going to have your character name on its
own line and their dialog lines right
under that now sometimes on the same
line of your character name you're going
to see a little dialogue note and it's
abbreviated what is this what does it
mean now sometimes these abbreviated
notes are for the production how this
dialogue is supposed to be said where
it's supposed to be said so there's a
variety of them so let me go over them v
o means voice over o s and o c these
sound very very similar but they are not
similar off screen means the person is
talking but they're not really in the
same room or the same space
kira is off screen so she's in another
room she's not in the same room she's
not in the bathroom she's yelling over
like stacey ready for a gossip girl
marathon whereas if it said kira oc then
kira would be in the same room and we
could literally have the camera pan over
and she's right there off camera is
really good for reveals when you're
writing next we have our parentheticals
these are more specific directions for
your character or for the way they're
supposed to say their lines it's a
smaller way to give that direction
without taking up a whole action line
for example a store employee is giving a
customer a receipt they can say have a
nice day and in a parenthetical it can
say handing receipts that's just like a
simple example of that it can be used to
explain to the actor how they should say
they're lying for example yelling
crying or it can be used to tell the
actor there needs to be a moment they're
talking and then there's a beat or a
change in thought then or a sigh or it
can help clarify to an actor what
specifically they're talking about for
example let's go back to the coffee shop
exterior coffee house day now we have
two characters outside and they're
drinking their coffee and one of them
says why is it so cold that's kind of a
vague statement for an actor we might
not know what our character is supposed
to be talking about are they talking
about why is it so cold outside why is
my coffee so cold so a way that a
screenwriter can specify that for an
actor is by saying re so in a
parenthetical they could say re-coffee
why is it so cold and it'll help us as
an actor understand how we should say
our mind because if it was re weather
why is it so cold we'd be looking up at
this guy we'd go like this why is it so
cold you know but if it was our coffee
we'd take somebody like why is it so
cool
take this back lastly we have our
transitions
and cuts now for transitions these go at
the bottom left corner of your scene now
transitions again establish more of the
tone of the piece uh the pacing how they
want to shoot it there's a whole bunch
of videos on the different types of cuts
and transitions so i'm not really going
to go over that in this for example if a
writer writes jump cut maybe we know the
pace of the sequence is fast and it's
energetic maybe if we have a match cut
that's a little more artistic or if we
just have a cut too and there are so
many other things like
pre-lapse and act breaks again there's
so many different script formats a
multicam comedy script is not going to
look the same as a five act procedural
drama there's different formatting with
the action lines in the dialogue because
comedy ones use double space and other
one doesn't so there's a lot of stuff
not every script is the same if you want
to learn more about the other types of
scripts you already know leave a comment
down below and let me know what you want
to see next if you want me to explain
more about this or if you literally
don't care and you want me to make
something else comment down below what
your favorite script element is
my favorite script element my favorite
element of script is definitely dialogue
i love no
this is hard actually i like action
lines because they force you to be
really concise but also say so much and
paint this picture i think action lines
are my favorite
dialogue's cool
i really like frick okay i'm torn but
let me know what your favorite element
of a script is in the comments below and
i would love to see what you guys think
and we can compare but yeah
screenwriting is very complex this is
just the basics of formatting there's so
much that goes into it i hope you guys
found this helpful and if you made it to
the end of the video don't forget to
leave without subscribing please like
this video so more people find this
video and my channel can grow it would
mean the world to me you can also follow
me on my instagram if you want more
screenwriting content be sure to check
out this video how to break down a
script i think it'll be really helpful

you

At around 12:05pm on the 11th of July, 
1978, a fully-loaded tanker truck  
left a state-owned refinery in a small town 
in the autonomous Catalonian region of Spain.
It set off on a routine trip to Puertollano, 
an industrial city approximately six hours away  
by road. The truck never reached its 
destination. Before it was even halfway  
there it would become the cause of an accident 
which would claim more than 200 innocent lives.
The truck was owned and 
operated by Cisternas Reunidas,  
a company which specialized in the transport 
of hazardous chemicals and other merchandise.
The chemical being transported on the day of the 
disaster was indeed a hazardous one: liquefied  
propylene. Propylene of this type is used in 
the manufacture of a huge range of products,  
everything from photographic 
film to food containers.  
In its raw form, however, it is an 
intensely volatile flammable material.
Propylene is normally a gas, but is stored under 
pressure as a liquid for processing and transport.  
Reports concerning how the incident began 
vary hugely. The truck, fully loaded with  
liquid propylene, was passing through the 
region of Alcanar on a relatively small road  
when something went wrong. Some witnesses state 
that the truck swerved and crashed while others  
report it sprang a leak, prompting the driver to 
stop and try to fix the problem. Whether the truck  
stopped or crashed is unknown, but what is certain 
is that the main body of the container ruptured.  
Propylene began to leak from the stationary 
tanker, instantly becoming a gas. This gas formed  
a dense white cloud which, assisted by the breeze, 
drifted over the nearby Los Alfaques campsite.
The site was packed with around 
1,000 holidaymakers at the time.  
The cloud had expanded to cover such a distance 
that few people present on the campsite could  
see the stranded truck or judge the source 
of the strange cloud. Unaware of its origin,  
some even approached it out of curiosity, perhaps 
considering it a freak weather phenomenon.  
While the cloud enveloped the campsite tendrils 
of gaseous propylene had also drifted up the road  
all the way to a nearby discotheque. There the gas 
encountered a spark, or other source of ignition.  
Flames erupted, flashing back through the cloud 
all the way to the tanker which exploded with  
colossal force. The cloud of gas enveloping the 
campsite became, in mere moments, a fireball.  
Everything within 90 meters (or 300 feet) 
of the truck was destroyed by the blast.  
Cars were melted, buildings leveled, and people 
killed outright. Everything within 300 meters  
(or 980 feet) was ravaged by fire. This 
included almost the entire campsite.  
Victims were seen with their hair and clothes 
ablaze, fleeing into the sea in an attempt to  
put out the flames. Some witnesses report that the 
sea itself boiled in the heat from the explosion.
The heat and flames also caused 
several secondary explosions.  
34 vehicles were gutted, in total, with 
some exploding and causing further injury.  
Cylinders of cooking gas used by 
campers became deadly explosives.
In the immediate aftermath a rescue effort began.  
Locals loaded the injured into cars and vans and 
drove them at full speed to nearby hospitals.
Firefighters and ambulance personnel arrived 
and began the impossible task of triaging  
hundreds of severely injured people.
In total 140 people with severe burns were 
transported to one of two local hospitals  
over the course of three long hours.
On the 11th of July 1978 the disaster 
claimed the lives of 217 people,  
although many more died of their injuries 
in the weeks and months which followed.  
The final toll was around 
270 dead and 300 injured.
The task of identifying all of 
the victims was a gargantuan one,  
complicated still further by the fact that 
many of the dead were wearing only swimsuits,  
with no forms of identification 
to be found about their person.
The building within the campsite where records 
were kept had also been completely destroyed.  
While all of the victims of the disaster 
were eventually identified, in many cases  
by dental records, it sometimes took years before 
remains were returned to their country of origin.  
An investigation revealed multiple failures in 
safety protocol which contributed to the disaster.  
The tanker, it was noted, had been overfilled 
- something that was routine practice at the  
Enpetrol refinery. The facility had no measuring 
device to determine how full a tanker was,  
nor an automatic shutoff to prevent 
overfilling. In the months before  
the disaster many tankers leaving the 
facility had been dangerously overloaded.
Additionally the tanker had no emergency pressure 
relief valves. Previously this would have  
precluded it from carrying flammable materials, 
but regulations had recently been loosened in  
this regard and pressure release valves were no 
longer mandatory at the time of the disaster.  
The lack of pressure release valves was 
compounded by weaknesses in the hull of the tank.  
Close examination revealed that it had previously 
been used to transport corrosive substances  
which had greatly weakened the structural 
integrity of the walls of the tank.  
While an undamaged container with pressure release 
valves might still have exploded eventually,  
it would likely have remained intact long enough 
for the immediate area around it to be evacuated.
Cisternas Reunidas accepted responsibility 
for the disaster and shouldered the blame  
for all these oversights, but there was 
one point where there was some dispute.  
Drivers reported that they had routinely 
been instructed to avoid using the motorway  
in favor of smaller roads that passed through 
densely populated areas. The reason? To avoid  
the company having to reimburse them for a 
motorway toll. Cisternas Reunidas insisted  
that the route taken was entirely down to the 
drivers and no official conclusion was reached.
Ultimately four employees of Cisternas Reunidas 
were given jail sentences for gross negligence.  
These were relatively short terms and 
in all cases were quashed within a year.  
Compensation amounting to around 13 million 
Euros (15.8 million Dollars) was paid to  
the victims - enough to settle all 
civil suits against the company.  
Over the months and years that followed the 
tragedy many changes were made to regulations  
surrounding the transport of dangerous goods 
- most notably it was forbidden for dangerous  
goods to be transported through populated 
areas when an alternate route was available.
The Los Alfaques campsite was rebuilt.  
The owner notes that she is still traumatized 
by the events of the 11th of July 1978,  
but that there is no better comfort to her 
than welcoming holidaymakers to the campsite -  
including several families who survived the 
disaster and have chosen to return year on year.  
While the site is forever haunted by the specter 
of the explosion, the landscape will recover,  
and better memories than those of that dark 
day will be made there for many years to come.

The Battle of Teutoburg Forest is one of 
the grimmest days in Roman military history  
which has captivated historians and the general 
public for centuries. Naturally much attention has  
been placed on analyzing the lead up to battle, 
the ambush, and the ensuing ripple effects across  
the Empire. In these narratives, the subject of 
the battlefield itself is only useful up until the  
Roman army is defeated at which point it becomes 
discarded in favor of other, more relevant topics.  
Rarely do we hear about what happened in the dark 
forests after the fighting ended or of the Roman  
army’s return to these haunted lands. Today let 
us explore this fascinating historical blindspot.

As the story goes, three Roman legions and their 
auxiliaries entered the forests of Germania in  
9 AD and met their doom at the hands of the 
traitor Arminius and his cleverly laid trap.  
The fighting occurred in stages over 
several days as the Roman column was  
slowly gnawed upon and eventually swallowed 
whole. Seeing this inevitable doom upon them,  
the imperial officer corp and General 
Varus himself committed suicide.
After the Roman army had completed its convulsive 
death throes, the entire forest must have come to  
an ominous still. It's hard to imagine just 
what that transition must have felt like  
as the violent yells of some 20,000 dead or 
captured gave way to the chirping of birds.
What happened next is not clear as we have no 
direct sources on the matter from the victor’s  
perspective. However we can start to get an idea 
from a few key Roman writers like Tacitus combined  
with our understanding of warfare from the period 
as well as the findings of modern archaeology.
The first people to set foot on the 
battlefield once the fighting had  
ended would have been the 
victorious German tribes.  
Several immediate goals were in order:
1. Hunting down survivors 
2. Tending to the dead
3. Taking prizes
The first order of business would already have 
begun over the course of the battle and extended  
several days after. The author Paterculus for 
example mentions an instance of Roman horsemen  
abandoning the main body of infantry during 
the assault and fleeing for the Rhine  
only to be slain along the way. Elsewhere it 
seems that groups of soldiers or individuals  
melted away into the surrounding 
woods and marshes seeking refuge.  
The Germans however knew that this was their 
chance to inflict as much damage as possible  
to the enemy and would not have allowed their 
quarry to slip so easily through their net. After  
all THEY were the masters of this land and would 
have held the advantage in such a deadly hunt.
Archaeology of the area reveals incredible 
stories of the pursuit that occured.  
For instance near a portion of the Germanic 
wall, a bell was found, still attached to the  
neck of a mule. It was stuffed full of grass, 
indicating that some panicked Roman soldiers  
had attempted to silence it in their desperation 
to avoid detection while listening to the cries  
of their comrades being slaughtered around them. 
It's unlikely that their efforts were successful.  
Other stories are small and similarly terrifying: 
the small scatterings of coins that tell of an  
officer's purse that spilled across the muddy 
ground. The small caches where soldiers dug  
holes for their money. The clasps from 
armour that was torn off of the bodies.  
The surgeons' tools, all lying together, as the 
medics themselves were killed or taken captive.  
We do know that some Roman soldiers did 
manage to make it out of there alive  
and fall back to their own lines, regrouping 
at the last standing fortress of Aliso.  
However the percentage of those who 
achieved such an escape was quite low.
Meanwhile the Germans would have begun their 
second initiative, tending to the dead. The  
tribesmen were sure to comb over the battlefield 
recovering as many of their own as possible.  
Any wounded allies would be quickly brought 
to their own healers while any Roman survivors  
were generally dispatched with a spear thrust 
to the neck. Those Germans who could not be  
saved or who had already perished would have been 
brought back to their own villages where funeral  
arrangements could be made. Such ceremonies 
varied from locale to locale - but typically  
involved the dead being placed on a pyre, a speech 
being delivered by the head of the community,  
and the body being burned by the deceased 
individual's surviving family. The warrior’s  
weapons might accompany him in the fire, be placed 
alongside his ashes in a grave, or stay with the  
family which kept his burnt remains in a treasured 
urn to be passed down through the generations.
The Romans suffered a far less 
solemn and honourable fate.  
Like many other cultures around the world, the 
Germans took prisoners after a victory in battle.  
The lucky ones would be carted 
off to face a life of servitude.  
The unlucky ones would be sacrificed to the gods. 
It seems that this act could take many forms.  
Tacitus mentions how special altars had been 
prepared for prominent centurions and tribunes.  
Tradition dictated that such victims be 
treated just like any other animal offering.  
As such a priest would oversee the affair, 
chanting a prayer to the subject deity while  
preparing to wield the sacred knife. Roman sources 
claim that the actual killing would only come  
once the victim had assented to the rite. For 
livestock this would be done by using a rope to  
induce a bow from the animal. Its easy to imagine 
the same being done to their Roman replacements.  
Once this step had been completed, the 
priest would slash the victim’s neck,  
allowing the blood to spill over the 
altar, the priest, and the land itself.
Other victims were ritually hung from oak trees. 
The practice involved teams of men raising the  
captive with a rope, slowly strangling the 
victim while a priest chanted his prayers.  
Yet more sacrificial practices called for 
decapitation with the severed heads being  
nailed to the trees as a way to demarcate an 
entire area as a gruesome temple to victory.  
Finally, some Romans were simply just thrown 
into the marshes, already considered to be  
sacred ground, as both an offering and a thanks 
to the gods in the dark recesses of the woods.  
But such special attention could not be paid 
to the thousands of Roman vanquished. The rest  
would be afforded no honours or holy rites. They 
would be cleared from the road, which was still  
an important route for commerce and communication, 
and piled up haphazardly to rot in the open air.
As the bodies were moved, the Germans 
would undertake their third immediate goal,  
the taking of prizes. There was 
much of material value to be looted.  
For instance, governor Varus and his officers 
surely had riches aplenty stored away in their  
baggage train near the head of the army 
while the troops stowed their own prized  
possessions in the baggage compartments taking 
up the rear. Among the carts strewn across the  
forest would also be valuables belonging to 
the camp followers who accompanied the army.  
Once these trunks had been emptied, the dead 
themselves would be despoiled. Purses cut,  
jewelry snatched off, and rings pried from cold, 
bloated fingers. This would have been a gold rush  
for the victors who could have gotten their hands 
on everything from rare minerals to cooking wares.
But perhaps some of the most prized sources of 
loot would be the tens of thousands of sets of  
weapons and armour. Afterall every Roman soldier 
was a professional with their own set of high end  
kit forged by skilled manufacturers and smiths. 
These had long been prized in Germany as valuable  
trade goods and for practical use in inter-tribal 
warfare. It seems that the battlefield was so  
thoroughly picked clean of these items that 
archaeological investigations of the site  
have failed to turn up weapons and armour in 
any large numbers. Instead what we find are  
thousands of tiny nails from Roman sandals which 
the barbarians showed no interest in collecting.
One of the most iconic pieces that's been found 
on the site of Teutoburg, though, is an iron  
mask. It's thought to have been the property of 
one of the German auxiliaries who betrayed the  
Roman army. It was originally plated in silver, 
but the silver was stripped off for reuse.  
The mask itself, though, was left at the foot 
of the wall that had been built for this ambush,  
in a spot where the killing had been the 
highest. It was a symbol and an offering:  
the auxiliary who left it wanted to ensure that 
passersby knew who had done this, wanted to  
offer it as a sacrifice, and wanted to indicate 
that he had cast aside all of his former ties.
Another important battlefield prize were the 
Roman army standards. Though not of much material  
value they had tremendous symbolic value. This 
was especially true of the legionary eagles.  
Two of these were apparently captured by 
the Germans immediately after the battle  
while the third was only found later amid the 
marshes where a legionary soldier had hid it.  
The standards would be taken back to the 
tribal homelands as symbols of victory.
But these weren't the only bits 
of memorabilia brought home.  
It seems that the Germans also collected bits of 
human bodies as trophies and talismans. While the  
mass graves from Teutoburg are inconclusive 
on their own, other burial sites across the  
region have missing bones, which are assumed to 
have been taken by the victors in other battles.  
The most prominent of these prizes, of 
course, was the head of Quintilius Varus,  
which was sent by Arminius to the Marcomanni 
tribe in hopes of bringing them to his side.  
However their king wished to avoid the inevitable 
wrath of the legions and promptly sent it on  
to Rome as a gesture of goodwill. He knew that 
Roman vengeance would come soon after the shock,  
and that they would have no mercy for those 
who had committed such an act of aggression.
Indeed, the Roman response came quickly. Once 
Augustus had shaken off the shock of the news  
he immediately ordered his most capable general, 
Tiberius, to lead a campaign of retribution.  
He was an excellent choice of a commander who had 
just put down the massive Illyrian revolt and had  
extensive experience with both guerilla combat and 
germanic warfare. However to the dismay of those  
who craved immediate vengeance, Tiberius exercised 
his disciplined approach to war by methodically  
securing the border and slowly pushing into 
Germany rather than blitzing into the fray. He  
succeeded in re-securing the frontier but departed 
after two years with much left to be done.  
Tiberius would be replaced by one 
of his most talented young proteges  
who would become known as Germanicus. As 
the agnomen implies, he would achieve great  
things in Germania with a series of campaigns 
that finally avenged the fallen of Teutoburg.
One of the most striking moments of this 
saga occurs when Germanicus led the Roman  
army back to the site of battle. Here 
is how Tacitus describes the event:
"A passionate desire burned in the Caesar to pay 
the last tribute to the fallen and their leader,  
and the whole army present with him were 
stirred to pity at the thought of their kindred,  
of their friends, and of the chances of battle 
and of the fate of mankind. Sending Caecina  
forward to explore the secret forest passes and 
to throw bridges and causeways over the flooded  
marshes and treacherous levels, they marched over 
the dismal tract, hideous to sight and memory.  
Varus' first camp, with its broad sweep and 
measured spaces for officers and eagles,  
advertised the labours of three legions: then a 
half-ruined wall and shallow ditch showed that  
there! the now broken remnant had taken cover. In 
the plain between were bleaching bones, scattered  
or in little heaps, as the men had fallen, fleeing 
or standing fast. Nearby lay splintered spears  
and the limbs of horses, while human skulls 
were nailed prominently on the tree-trunks.  
In the neighbouring groves stood the savage altars 
at which they had slaughtered the tribunes and  
chief centurions. Survivors of the disaster, 
who had escaped the battle or their chains,  
told how - here the legates fell, there the 
eagles were taken, where the first wound was  
dealt upon Varus, and where he found death 
by the suicidal stroke of his own unhappy  
hand. They spoke of the tribunal from which 
Arminius made his speech, all the gibbets and  
torture-pits for the prisoners, and the arrogance 
with which he insulted the standards and eagles.
And so, six years after the fatal field, 
a Roman army, present on the ground,  
buried the bones of the three legions; and no man 
knew whether he consigned to the earth the remains  
of a stranger or a kinsman, but all thought 
of all as friends and members of one family,  
and, with anger rising against 
the enemy, mourned and hated. 
At the erection of the funeral-mound the Caesar 
laid the first sod, paying tribute to the  
departed, and associating himself with the grief 
of those around him. But Tiberius disapproved,  
possibly because he considered acts of Germanicus 
with a jealous suspicion, possibly because he  
thought that the sight of the unburied dead must 
have given the army less alacrity for battle and  
more respect for the enemy, while a commander, 
invested with the augurate and administering the  
most venerable rites of religion, ought to have 
avoided all contact with a funeral ceremony." 
Tacitus' account is gripping in 
its detail and evocative passages.  
However while we would do well to take 
his sensational tale with a grain of salt,  
it's one of the only remaining sources 
we have to go by regarding this event.  
Luckily though modern archaeologists have been 
able to at least confirm that the Romans did  
indeed return to the site with the discovery of 
8 mass graves identified as containing the bones  
of military aged men with signs of traumatic 
injuries. Even today, excavations continue to  
uncover more of this 2,000 year old tragedy and 
we will surely know more as the work progresses.
We hope you appreciated this deep dive 
into an under-covered aspect of history.  
Let me know if you’d like to hear more 
about the aftermath of other famous battles.
A huge thanks to the Patrons for funding 
the channel and to the researchers,  
writers, and artists who made this video possible. 
Thanks for watching and see you in the next one.

if you are tired of cold weather and
busy city life and would like to
experience warm tropical weather white
sandy beaches scuba diving snorkeling
deep-sea adventure or you would like to
explore history archaeology and learn
about a new culture while maybe none of
these but you would like to spend your
vacation in a paradise like settings
then Belize is your dream destination
assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullah welcome
to Belize
Belize is a small country in Central
America in the north is connected with
Mexico in the west and south is
Guatemala Honduras is just a short
distance away but has a common border
through the ocean on the east side is
connected with Caribbean ocean and thus
the open world Belize is a very small
country with about 350,000 inhabitants
most of its inhabitants live in the
cities like Belize City chorus all
orange walk Belmopan Punta Gorda Dan
Gregor and placencia most of the people
speak English however Spanish is widely
understood but there is another thing
that people speak which is called Creole
Creole is a kind of broken English which
you might be able to understand a part
of if you pay attention however when the
people talk to each other you would not
be able to understand anything
people are from the descendants of the
African slaves who were brought here a
few centuries ago and thus have been
settled in this land however there are a
people a lot of people from the other
places like Honduras and Guatemala and
Mexico and other countries who are
living in peace and harmony despite
their differences of race and religion
in general the least is a peaceful place
where people understand each other
being a small place almost everybody
knows everybody but that does not mean
that there are no dangerous areas one
needs to be careful when he comes here
in which area he goes and in which areas
to a wide but at the same time people of
Belize are very friendly because of that
government is developing this country as
a huge tourist attraction a number of
cruise ships come here every day and
every year and that provides the local
people employment opportunities people
make handicrafts at home sell them in
the tourist village and other troost
attractions which provides them means of
earning
the history of Belize dates back
thousands of years
several major archaeological sites
including cahal pech Caracol lamanai
lubaantun Alton ha
and Shannon tonic reflect the advanced
civilization and much denser population
of that period the Maya civilization
emerged at least three millennia ago in
the lowland area of the Yucatan
Peninsula and the highlands to the south
in what is now southeastern Mexico
Guatemala Western Honduras and Belize
many aspects of the culture persist in
the area despite nearly 500 years of
European domination believes both
important sites of the earliest Maya
settlements majestic loins of the
classic period and examples of the late
post Classic ceremonial construction the
first recorded European settlement was
established by shipwrecked English
seamen in 1638 over the next hundred and
50 years more English settlements were
established Belize was termed the colony
of British Honduras in 1840 it became a
crown colony in 1862 the official name
of the territory was changed from
British Honduras to Belize in June 1973
and full independence was granted on
September 21st 1981
Vineet is also known for this extreme
biodiversity and distinctive ecosystems
on the coast is a swampy coastal plain
with mangrove swamps in the south and
interior there are hills and low
mountains most of country is undeveloped
and is forested with hardwood
velocity is the largest city in Belize
its population is about 70,000
inhabitants until 1961 Belize City used
to be the capital of beliefs however
Belize City lies in direct path of
hurricanes in 1961 the city was
flattened with the hurricane thus it was
decided to move the capital inland and
Belmopan which is about 50 miles to the
west became the capital of Belize
currently the population of Belmopan is
only about 14,000 most of the people
live in Belize City tourists who come to
visit Belize do not stay in Belize City
mostly most of them like to go to the
islands like Key Cocker and San Pedro
that has beautiful sandy beaches
providing them with a lot of
opportunities to take part in the water
sports
Belize is blessed with the second
largest Barrier Reef in the world that
provides a lot of opportunities for you
to see the wildlife in this in the ocean
and different kind of fish live here it
provides you a lot of opportunities to
take part in the ocean sports if you are
interested in that police used to be a
closed country and not many people used
to come here however government started
changing the rules and regulations
opening up the country for the
foreigners and a lot of tourists started
coming here that created a lot of
opportunities for the people of Belize
however these opportunities are merely
not enough education level is not very
high a lot of people a lot of youngsters
drop out of school in very early age and
they fall through the cracks and they do
not know what to do so you will see a
lot of youngsters roaming around walking
in the streets doing nothing that's
creating a sense of loneliness in them
government is taking certain actions to
correct the situation however the
resources are not enough for these
people and they do not know what to do
with themselves so they are always
looking for some opportunity and that
also takes them onto the wrong path just
because of that Belize City is
clearly divided into two paths one is
the northern Belize and one is the
certain beliefs in the northern police
you will mostly find the people who are
well-off and they are living on their
own but in the southern Belize you will
find a lot of people who do not have
much opportunities or say no
opportunities at all and they do not
even have the place to sleep or they do
not even have anything to eat when
you're walking around if you ask
somebody have you had lunch or dinner
very calmly sometime they would tell you
no I didn't have anything to eat
there are many islands in the coastal
boundary of Belize many of them are
privately owned however some are open to
the public some are large enough to
sustain a good-sized City for example
Amburg is key in order to go to the
island you will need to get on a water
taxi for a 45 minutes ride to keikaku or
75 minutes ride to san pedro san pedro
is the city of 14,000 friendly people
and one of the major tourist attractions
in Belize City serves as a hub for
marine activities like snorkeling scuba
diving and day-long excursions to Blue
Hole
what do you guys do here well we provide
snorkeling excursions and uh which is a
Barrier Reef snorkel and an island
getaway I'm one of the part owners for
the island which is called starfish
island and we deal directly with the
cruise lines we have contracts with all
major cruise lines in Belize City and we
pick the guess up from the cruise ship
and take them to the Barrier Reef to
snorkel they snore for an hour and then
we take them to the island where they
have food drinks beach chairs to relax
music I see those tools are those the
scuba diving suits so those are off
snorkeling vests they're called BCS
buoyancy compensators they're all
required to use one and inflated you
know with just your breath just so that
when you're in the water you have
floatation and in case of emergency or
you need help you know there's something
to keep you afloat before you know one
of our guides or so could get to you too
so I don't know swimming and I you know
so what kind of fitness level do I need
can I go in the water with this o2
snorkel it requires a little bit of
physical strength and endurance it's not
a it's not an easy thing to do
of course if you do it a few times you
become a professional and then it
becomes easy then we work with you yeah
basically what it is is once you get
into what is to make yourself
comfortable
make yourself relaxed and realize hey
this is easy for me to do it I need just
need to get your breathing right we're
all accustomed to breathing through a
node but when you put the mask and a
stroke in your mouth then you have to
breathe through your your mouth because
if you try to breathe through your nose
then the same carbon monoxide that
you're extracting will just get the mask
all fogged up
so you need to get used to snorkeling
and breathing through your mouth so what
kind of fish and marine life do you see
basically out there there's a like
lobsters
eels lots of colorful fish most of the
fish that we have in Belize occasional
turtle lots of stingrays and sharks
occasionally you'll see a nurse shark
which is harmless we've never seen any
really dangerous shark but lots of
colorful fish lots of beautiful corals
and I mean we're proud to say that we
have the second largest Barrier Reef and
it's very colorful is still in prestige
shape so we try to keep it that way
and before we snorkel we always give a
briefing to our guests to you know to
ensure that they are aware and they're
educated enough to know that we're not
going to destroy the corals and make
sure we keep it the same way we we found
it it is expensive well it all goes
through the Pooh's lines I would say
it's it's cheap but it's not expensive
either if you want an experience and an
adventure you know to take full benefit
of what beneath has to offer around its
Barrier Reef one could go for scuba
diving windsurfing snorkeling and many
other marine activities however
snorkeling is something that an average
person can do easily even without any
knowledge of swimming toward course
takes you to the Barrier Reef that you
will be able to swim with the sharks
stingrays
turtles and many other types of fish in
their natural habitat
you
beside these islands are the truest
reflections our cave tubing inland blue
hole belize zoo and jungle tracks
there are several resorts set up all the
trois vallées that provide comfortable
living in the exotic settings to provide
you the ultimate jungle experience you
enjoy a good night's sleep in a mosquito
free environment and singing birds wake
you up in the morning some species of
villages flora and fauna include the
black orchard the mahogany tree the two
cones and tapers besides the magical
islands and botanical garden resorts
Belize is blessed with the Maya
Mountains that peak at almost 5000 feet
a drive through these mountains on the
southern highway takes you to the cities
of Hopkins Dan Riga placencia and Punta
Gorda Hopkins is a small coastal town
with friendly people and beautiful
beaches pasensya is situated at the end
of a long half-mile white strip that
connects it with the mainland Belize
licencias becoming a new tourist
destination with all the amenities of
Western world white sandy beaches and
nice restaurants placencia is full of
beautiful bungalows and gated
communities that are mostly owned by
experts from North America and Europe a
blending of cultures has resulted in one
of the happiest and most peaceful
countries in the region
Belize is blessed with a lot of marine
resources with the second largest
Barrier Reef in the world a lot of fish
and shrimps are harvested along the
Belizean coast
these are processed and exported to
other countries as well but the biggest
income and the employment that comes
with the ocean is the arrival of the
cruise ships almost every day a cruise
ship docks along the coast of Belize and
all those tourists flock to the city of
Belize with the taxi drivers are able to
make their income by taking the tourists
to visit the Mayan ruins and other
inland activities a lot of people who
make the handicrafts are able to sell
their handicrafts in the tourist village
and a lot of other employment
opportunities are connected with this
kind of truism other than the tourism
and marine resources agriculture is
another major aspect in the Belizean
economy Belize produces rice corn
sugarcane and a lot of other fruits that
are sold fresh here and also exported in
the western part of the LEAs oil is also
extracted
however it's merely not enough for the
Belize and a lot of oil is also imported
from the other countries one of the
nicest things about Belize is the
weather with an average yearly
temperature of 84 Fahrenheit or 29
degrees Celsius I saw this warm yet
comfortable coastal sea breezes as well
as the jungle and the rainforests keep
you cool even in the hottest summer
months while winters can be cool but
never very cold Belize is dry season is
between February and May and has
significantly lower rainfall than the
rest of the year when it does rain it is
usually a mile short first June for
December is wet season when parts of the
country receive up to 150 inches of rain
Belize also has a hurricane season and
while statistically Belize does not
attract any major direct hits it does
get its share of severe tropical weather
with high winds and rain in Belize
traditions and customs are varied and
represent more than a diverse cultures
for generations the people of Belize
have the
created a cultural commitment to
preserve the country's unique charms
whether you are an adventurer traveler
part of a family trip or in the country
for a relaxing Beach vacation every day
will be a new experience for you and
belizean people and culture will make
you feel welcomed and comfortable we
hope you enjoyed this short documentary
and believes will be part of your next
vacation plans assalamu alaikum

TK has been in prison for the last six
years out of a 55-year sentence given to
him by a jury prior to this he was on
house arrest for eight months when
suddenly he sent out a tweet stating he
had enough he and his best friend cut
off their ankle monitors and said they
were going on the run and if police
wanted them they were going to have to
come find them it would take U.S
Marshals a three-month Nationwide search
when they eventually apprehended him on
the other side of the country with TK
taunting them every step of the way
eventually on June 30th 2017 he was
captured but he had one more trick up
his sleeve to show the world just hours
after his arrest a music video to a song
titled the race was published on a
YouTube channel after social media got a
hold of it there was no going back
almost overnight TK would have a viral
hit on his hands people were now tuning
into this story of a 17 year old kid who
ran from the police made songs about it
and you couldn't even help but watch it
but nobody at the time knew the severity
of his crimes the blood of two innocent
people had been shed Timor McIntyre ever
so slightly rolled his head to the side
as the judge announced his 55-year
prison sentence for the murder of Ethan
Walker now at 22 years old he says he
never had the chance to be an adult one
of his co-defendants who was a white
female only got 10 years of probation
but TK was ultimately sentenced to 55
years in prison for just one of the
murders this led to him stating if he
was white he wouldn't have received such
a harsh punishment all he wants is a
second chance you got the world going
crazy right now
I heard something about it
[Music]
Tamar McIntyre was born June 16 2000 in
Long Beach California in deep Crips
territory both of his parents were gang
members and even though his dad was
always in and out of prison his mom was
still active with the baby insane cribs
while raising the two kids him and his
sister Kayla but things really took a
turn for the worse when his dad was
doing a seven year run in prison for a
deal gone bad in 2002 without a father
figure around it was hard for him to
find guidance eventually their mom was
unable to raise them and they soon found
themselves in the foster care system
bouncing around from different families
who ultimately didn't want them being in
foster care since we were like
really young like damn they're all our
life we never stay with our parents we
kind of stayed in different foster homes
bouncing around this was him and his
sister's childhood as they stayed in the
foster care system and they said they
never really experienced Christmas as a
kid
eventually his mom did escape the gang
life and she relocated the family about
four hours away to Las Vegas they ended
up only spending about a year there
until 2009 and that's because his dad
was released after serving his seven
years being forced to Texas was the last
thing they wanted but taymor was
enrolled in elementary school and then
eventually Middle School still he and
his sister felt trapped with their dad
who by now had started to abuse them
badly for the smallest things he didn't
want to think about it and he wanted to
be anywhere else but home so we stayed
at friends houses as much as he could
now the streets welcomed him and he
welcomed the streets
[Music]
in 2014 he was a freshman at Martin High
School but most of his time was spent
freestyling with his friends they called
themselves the Daytona boys they were
Rowdy and loud and would rap and smoke
weed whether they went to school that
day or ditched three people made up the
Daytona boys Eric Johnson or Santana
Sage Jalen Bell or pimps and Tamor who
now wrapped his tk-47 in addition they
had a manager named Ezra who was
important to the team and handled
everything behind the scenes to them
Daytona boys was a Brotherhood and the
group knew they had something special so
they figured why not start uploading on
Soundcloud but even with music in his
life he just couldn't stay out of
trouble this old tweet shows a letter of
him being expelled from high school
after he brought marijuana on grounds he
didn't want to go back to school and he
couldn't go back home so nothing really
mattered TK would often sleep over
Pimp's house at night and after being
kicked out of high school they only grew
closer he was on his own f 15 years old
now his full attention was on his music
and social media pushing the Daytona
boys as much as he could being seen in
interviews before anyone even knew who
they were
ready
and with their manager's help they were
even booking shows after their shows
would run into 2 A.M and in the night
they were in the streets doing what they
believed they had to do robbing stealing
and toting guns and anyone who got in
their way would learn with death
involved an exchange of words between
two car loans of people who just left a
party New Year's morning 2016.
on December 31st 2015 the Daytona boys
were at a New Year's show in Arlington
and finished around 2 A.M Santana Sage
was the only one with the car and he
always drove everyone around with TK and
pimps in the front and back they left
and pulled up to a stoplight when
another vehicle pulled alongside them
from here forward it's unsure what
exactly happened next but we do know
that Santana Sage fired a gun into the
other vehicle killing a 21 year old
college student Sarah musslinger In Cold
Blood driving off with TK and pimps as
the passengers he was later arrested
after police used his Twitter account to
match the vehicle it was a series of
Twitter posts that they say Led Led them
to Johnson all the way from this New
Year's Eve party that they say he
attended his defense was that the
Daytona boys were being called racial
slurs by the other car and that provoked
Santana but he only meant to scare them
with the gunshots but it didn't matter
an innocent girl was dead and her
parents were left to wonder why we'll be
okay TK and pimps however were both
Miners and face no charges their name
weren't even mentioned in court and when
you can just walk away from something
that big it makes you feel invincible
after a six-month trial a jury only took
three hours to find Santana Sage guilty
and gave him 44 years in prison we the
jury find the defendant Eric Jamal
Johnson guilty of the offense of murder
TK was still only 15 years old at that
time he had no money nowhere to live and
was not legally allowed to work he
needed a way to survive and he had to do
something
on July 26 2016 TK pimps and five others
would formulate a plan Sean Robinson
lotharian Marriott Arianna Barrett Megan
Holt and a minor named Mia together they
made a plan to Rob Mia's boyfriend 17
year old Zachary bellitt while he was
inside of his home their plan would go
like this Zachary and his roommate Ethan
were staying at a house located on the
1500 Block of Mansfield Texas TK and the
six others met in an apartment where
they gathered weapons and talked over
the plan pimps got brass knuckles and
two of the men grabbed guns TK was
unarmed and says he told the group to
have his back in case anything went down
Mia and her two friends Ariana and Megan
left to Zachary's house around 5 PM they
made it seem as if they just wanted to
smoke and hang out but what Zachary
didn't know was that TK pimps Sean and
lotharian were waiting down the street
in a car for a text message it seemed
simple enough but that night there
plants quickly fell apart
[Music]
when the three girls arrived they were
surprised to see there was a lot more
people in the home than they expected
and this pushed their plans back by
hours but they couldn't wait forever 10
pm was approaching TK and the others
became impatient as well feeling like it
was now or never the girls decided to go
ahead with their plan and made their way
to the door to unlock it when no one was
looking four men burst into the home two
of them armed with guns Sean held
Zachary at gunpoint and lotharian held
Ethan Walker at gunpoint with TK and
pimp still looking for anything of value
but they came short of what they were
promised the next few minutes happened
fast but when they hesitated lotharian
panicked and without even remember doing
it he shot Ethan Walker in the stomach
killing him
Sean would panic at the same time after
hearing the first shot go off and he
would shoot Zachary striking him in his
shoulder but only injuring him they knew
they messed up and it was only a matter
of time of when they got caught
in this now famous video that shows take
a crying during his interrogation
prosecutors and investigators were
trying to figure out what exactly
happened that night he finally broke
down and admitted to robbing but he says
he never shot or knew that anyone would
be killed Feud 6 video of Teen rapper
tay-k as police questioned him about his
role in a deadly home invasion in
Mansfield he had just turned 16 years
old and was being held in juvenile
detention for two weeks until an adult
could pick him up his sister Kayla had
just bought her apartment after saving
up for months and could now be his
Guardian since she turned 18. I had got
my apartment like I said we didn't have
a lot of family like that and Kimbo you
get released juveniles get released they
at some point they're gonna get released
you know so like he got released to me I
had my apartment I was 18. he was
officially released by a juvenile court
judge only if he agreed to wear a
constant surveillance ankle monitor
pimps was also released on house arrest
and stayed close with TK where they
would talk online every night police
kept Kayla's apartment on constant
surveillance and pulled over anyone who
left their building TK spent most of his
time online tweeting out things like
this asking his friends to come over and
record since he was on house arrest
releasing only a few songs on Soundcloud
at the time he was saving the rest for
something else the world hadn't really
heard of TK's name yet but he saw a
marketing opportunity where nobody else
did from July of 2016 all the way to
March of 2017 almost eight months he
stayed locked in his room thinking about
his next move the stress was getting to
him although only 16 he was looking to
be charged as an adult he had no lawyer
no money and didn't know what was going
to happen to him then he had an idea
go out my way
hey hey
on Sunday March 26 2017 late into the
night TK would post this now Infamous
tweet saying he was done with house
arrest and social media would spread it
around he called pimps and the two made
a plan they would both cut their ankle
monitors off and make it clear to the
world that this was all a game to them
and if police wanted them they were
gonna have to play hide and seek they
needed to get out of town and their
first stop would be three hours away in
San Antonio where they laid low for a
few weeks TK had no regard for being
wanted he was spotted by fans at malls
or even ordering food at local spots
pimps had been messaging a photographer
for a few days named Mark salvadar who
lived around the San Antonio area and
they were planning to meet up to take
pictures but in reality TK and pimps
needed money and they planned to rob an
innocent man of his camera equipment
they plan to meet around 5 PM near an
empty parking garage mark would show up
and hop into the car to smoke and when
he got inside they would take everything
he had and then forcefully kick him out
of the vehicle but when this went down
things didn't go according to planned
again Mar art began yelling as loud as
he could for help and he ran toward the
street they sped up after him trying to
run him over but he landed on the hood
and held on as they drove off they had
to pull into a Chick-fil-A parking lot
nearby to get him off when the car
stopped Mark got up stomped on the
windshield as hard as he could breaking
it this agitated TK and he allegedly
leaned out the window and shot him
flinging his body onto the ground and
leaving him there to die unknowing that
this was all captured by a nearby
surveillance now only one thing mattered
to take a and pims they had the camera
equipment and a little bit of money to
get to their next stop but they needed
to stop by home in Arlington first
foreign
[Music]
by now San Antonio police had already
tied taking pimps to the murder of Mark
from last month at Chick-fil-A realizing
they needed to leave immediately they
plan to go on a 23-hour car ride in New
Jersey where they knew a few people in a
place to stay any money they had left
would be used just to get there and they
needed every dollar he even had someone
willing to do a music video for free if
he went to Jersey
by now it was early June police were
receiving tips on his whereabouts
posting water posters in areas they
believed the two to be of course TK only
saw this as another marketing
opportunity and decided to make a song
about his race from the police he
started the market opportunity when he
saw his Market opportunity you know he
did create a song called the race
he's running around he's showing the you
know they got my face on this whatever
whatever
poked fun at the whole process of people
actually looking for him it was perfect
timing and to make it better he wanted
to release the song on his birthday
those following his SoundCloud and
Twitter were the first to hear the song
but there was no video just yet TK along
with the help of a cameraman would film
the music video to the race the
following day and he didn't charge him a
penny for it it would only take about a
day to edit the video but it was ready
whenever TK was the two spent their last
weeks of Freedom hiding and eluding the
law in New Jersey Marshals could tell
they were getting close to capturing him
and at this point it was simply a matter
of when
please
exactly two weeks after his birthday
both were eventually apprehended in a
New Jersey home a total of three months
spanning 96 days and the race had
finally ended June 30th 2017.
but TK still had one more trick up his
sleeve and he wanted the whole world to
know his story before he went down just
two hours after he was arrested the
music video to the race was uploaded to
YouTube The Story of this shooter kid
who ran from the U.S Marshals and filmed
a music video while doing it people were
instantly engaged and social media
pushed it to every corner of the
internet people couldn't help but tune
into the song as it was getting hundreds
of thousands of views every day showing
no signs of slowing down some of the
first remixes and endorsements by other
rappers showed up in the hashtag free TK
was being posted but nobody really
acknowledged what he was now facing now
law enforcement wanted to make an
example out of TK and Texas shows no
mercy for the crime of murder a month
after being arrested a judge ruled to
sentence him as an adult at 17 years old
but in the outside world the race had
gotten almost 20 million views by now
and some record labels were taking
notice he would still sign a deal amid
two murder charges using all of his past
songs they released a project titled
Santana world with the race headlining
the project and of course it was very
successful
over the course of the next six months
the race would accumulate over 100
million views including a remix from 21
Savage and young nudie making him one of
the only artists in history to have a
massive hit song and never perform it
yet he still appeared to have high hopes
of beating his case and coming out the
other side of free man to him living in
jail was only a temporary thing and he
would soon be out but now early into
2018 sentences for the 2016 murder of
Ethan Walker began being handed out
thank you
the first to go down was Megan Holt who
was sentenced to 20 years in February
the courts recognized her as The
Mastermind behind the whole thing while
Mia Zach's girlfriend had been
cooperating and working closely with the
police and in exchange was only given a
10-year probation sentence the dominoes
around TK were starting to fall
he had already been denied Bond and now
the state district judge was upset with
the internet support for him here's what
he said it's my understanding that
people throughout this country have free
TK signs up and this court has a problem
with that
just after his bail was denied lotharian
Merit was also sentenced to 40 years
after being named the person who shot
Ethan Walker and the gunman later in
June the media reported that TK was
being sued by Mark Salvador's parents
for one million dollars in Damages for
the Chick-fil-A killing this is after
finding out he had become a superstar
since his capture almost a year before
the following month in July the parents
of Ethan Walker and Zachary below would
follow Sue seeking an additional 1
million dollars from the profits made
off of the race while this is happening
Adam 22 was able to get an exclusive
10-minute phone interview from jail
where TK would tell the world he was
going to be out soon that's crazy to
think about that you probably would have
already seen the world right now if you
if you weren't locked up like there's
crazy amount of opportunities to be
available to you right now
but during this interview he also made a
huge mistake by admitting he had an iPad
in his jail cell
just days later he would have a
Shakedown where the iPad was found with
Adam later even stating he felt guilty
for it happening the management did not
ask me to remove the part where he
talked about having an iPad and so then
he gets in solitary all kinds of
whatever additional charges because he
had an iPad and he's just in jail using
the iPad by August take a transfer from
the Tarrant County Jail in Texas to a
maximum security long evidence
Corrections Center being put into a
solitary confinement cell for 23 hours a
day but he never lost his positive
optimism and he posted a picture of
himself on Twitter the caption read live
from the gates of hell
she said
the murder charges for Ethan Walker were
coming to a close and another sentence
was handed to Ariana Barrett for
aggravated robbery in exchange for her
testifying against the remaining three
men she was only given 25 years a week
after that Sean Robinson was given 40
years for the murder pimps and TK were
still left waiting for their sentence
Bolton died for a second murder charge
of Mark Salvador pimps was even offered
a deal to testify against AKA but he
never turned his back to him it was
still a Brotherhood there and loyalty
was forever but in November of 2018
pimps would pay the ultimate price for
his crimes pleading guilty to two counts
of aggravated robbery of Ethan Walker
and Mark Salvador being given 30 years
just like that TK's best friend was gone
now he was the final man standing and
the world wanted to know what was going
to happen to him but no one as much as
he wanted to know
the jury deliberated for a little longer
than three hours today here before
deciding on that 55-year sentence that
song in July of 2019 his trial finally
began three years of evidence and
testimonies being gathered and
prosecutors had a strong case
he pleaded guilty for aggravated robbery
but not the murderer his defense argued
that he was a miner who played the least
significant role but it was apparent the
jury had already heard enough the lyrics
for the race were legally being used
against him and they even stated that he
thrived off the violence and showed no
remorse for his actions his trial only
lasted one week and by that Friday the
jury unanimously decided that he was
guilty taymor says he was only 16 and
misguided at the time when this all
happened claiming he was never given a
chance to be an adult his misguided
childhood is sad but should never be
used as an excuse for taking the lives
of others turning 22 years old from
behind a cell TK has definitely matured
and is more open to talking about his
treatment in prison and he argues the
question is he rightfully owed a second
chance to make things right

What If instead of watching The
Fountains at the Bellagio in Las Vegas
you're instead driving across a bridge
to the luxurious Beau Rivage or if
instead of watching the volcano at the
Mirage you are staying at the luxurious
Bombay Club what if the man credited
with building the modern Las Vegas ended
up losing his Empire over accusations of
actual assault and not to mention a
federal investigation to meddling in a
foreign government some of those things
never came to pass and tragically for
Steve Nguyen several of them actually
happened Steve went is credited with
being the father of the Modern Day Las
Vegas experience but it wasn't always a
sure bet he would succeed in Sin City
along with his successes there have been
personal tragedies and loss lawsuits and
heavy allegations if Steve win a
business Visionary that saw the future
of gaming or a man that took his power
and wielded it to destroy the career of
innocent young women who spoke out
against him stick through to the end of
this video for one of the most bizarre
and twisted ends to a Vegas story that
you might ever hear from his early life
initial failure on Las Vegas strip to
its amazing impact to the city and
recent troubling allegations lawsuits
and his Fall From Grace
this is the story of Stephen A Wynn
now creating a video on Steve Wynn isn't
easy he tends to have a habit of suing
people if they say things about him that
might damaged him or his brand
okay I'm making that up think not in
1997 he nearly put publisher barricade
books out of business after they
released an unauthorized biography about
his life
now sure that book was suggested that he
had Direct highs to the mafia but with
this video I need to tread lately when
we discuss how Steve was forced to leave
the industry he revolutionized
altogether more on that later but for
now I guess we'll just start at the
beginning and that means the start of
Steve's life but before there even was a
Steve win and all there was was a
Stephen Allen Weinberg his father
changed the family name a few years
after young Steve was born claiming he
wanted to avoid anti-jewish
discrimination but if I had to speculate
it might have something to do with the
somewhat controversial lifestyle his
father was known for but more on that in
a second Steve was raised in Utica New
York and his father sent him to only the
finest schools with Steve graduating
from The Mentalist School an expensive
private school meant to keep Steve away
from the same business his father had
been involved in most of his life so
what business was that the not so
prestigious bingo parlor business of
which the senior win ran several along
the east coast of the United States and
if you thought that young Steve made his
first trip to Las Vegas in the 1960s you
would be wrong having moved got to Sin
City as a boy with his father as his
father attempted to move up to the big
leagues and manage the bingo parlor a
thin Silver Slipper it was during this
trip which ultimately ended in a
complete failure in bankruptcy of the
parlor that a few things became evident
to the young Steve firstly that his
father had a really vicious gambling
addiction and that as he was quoted as
saying later in life the only way to win
in a casino is to own the casino
nevertheless his father tried to keep
young Steve away from gaming even
sending him to the University of
Pennsylvania where he earned his
Bachelor of Arts in English literature
with a career path that would next see
him transfer to Yale law school a path
which would change radically when he
received a call in March of 1963
informing him tragically that his father
had died during open heart surgery upon
traveling back to the family as the
eldest son to help with settling his
father's Affairs Wynn learned his
father's gambling habit had not stopped
in Vegas with a failed bingo parlor but
instead just kept going to the tune of a
staggering 350 thousand dollars and if
that doesn't seem staggering right now
it was in 1963 in today's money that
translates with inflation to over 3.4
million dollars it was at that point
that his father's plans to remain out of
a family business ended and when entered
into the bingo parlor industry
determined to write the ship and dig his
family out of financial ruin within just
five years Wynn was able to turn the
bingo parlor business around he cashed
out in order to Head West to Las Vegas
his plan here was simple become a
minority shareholder in one of the
original strip casinos but little did he
know that he'd be caught in Scandal
nearly from year one the story of Steve
Wynn in Las Vegas starts with the
property long turned to dust in the
desert and as we will see at the end of
this video Steve may have had in a way
his revenge on the first deal that ever
did him dirty in Las Vegas it all
started in 1967 with Steve taking a
thirty thousand dollar loan and
combining it with fifteen thousand
dollars of his own money he bought into
a group redeveloping what was previously
known as the New Frontier now this would
be Steve's first taste at the rotten
Legacy left by the mafia after just a
few years it was discovered that the
project had been financed with money
linked to the Detroit Mafia this also
LED win to losing out for the first and
possibly the last time to a fellow
casino owner and before long the group
decided to sell out to then king of Las
Vegas Howard Hughes for 25 million
dollars because Steve had a small share
in the project just enough to earn
profits from Casino wins he walked away
with very little from the sale and after
a few years operating a wine and liquor
importing company when was ready to
re-enter the gaming industry in Las
Vegas by 1973 wind became the majority
shareholder in the Golden Nugget in
downtown Las Vegas and was also at that
time the youngest casino owner in the
city when changed the way people viewed
downtown Las Vegas promoting the Golden
Nugget as a destination were acts like
Frank Sinatra Dolly Parton and Kenny
Rogers would play by 1983 you wined
parlaida's investment into the Golden
Nugget into a huge success making what
was at the time the smallest Casino in
Vegas into what was at the time the
number one most profitable while
downtown was a success win still had his
sight set on what was then becoming
known as the big leagues in Vegas a shot
to play the casino Monopoly game on the
main Las Vegas strip and if timing and
location are everything wind was
certainly in the right place at the
right time you see since when first
arrived in Las Vegas all those years ago
the casino industry had experienced a
dramatic overhaul with people like win's
Banker friend e Perry Thomas and state
lawmakers changing laws in 1967 to allow
corporations to own casinos and gaming
licenses the fact that win was a bona
fide legit business person with
connections to Wall Street further
helped him gain capital for his projects
all of this success was mixed with
bitter personal experiences when
divorced his wife Elaine whom he married
in 1967 in 1986. now this is just the
start of a cycle with what we will learn
about win later on in the video with a
string of relationships lawsuits and
questions that would often set him off
at times storming out of interviews and
allegedly going off on rants over his
employees
the question is how can you be sure how
can you be positive how can anybody well
you can't in this world
what you can be sure of is that in the
end oddest people will do the right
thing
that's why we all survive Mel Harris and
we kept our gambling licenses in the
state of New Jersey recommended our
licensing after they investigated this
and if I don't see that sentence in this
edited version of this tape I will choke
both of you after this question and
answer
it was in 1987 however that wind changed
the casino industry forever when sold
his Atlantic City Golden Nugget property
to help fund the project and then did
something unheard of turning to Wall
Street and financing the property using
risky junk bonds junk bonds are bonds
essentially money lent out to be paid
back later which are considered very
high risk this means that lenders often
expect them to fail but we'll lend them
out for high returns that they can offer
this was the first time that any casino
property was financed by Wall Street
with pass Vegas strip locations getting
crooked loans from Teamsters unions now
as this video is about Steve Wynn we're
not going to focus entirely on too many
of the single casinos subscribe right
now because we'll be covering all these
on their own in dedicated videos but all
you need to know about the Mirage is
that it was a huge Financial Risk
kicking off a new era of Las Vegas that
would pave the way for the present day
all eyes were focused on wins in the
sprawling 3000 room Fantasy Island that
now dominates the Las Vegas Strip the
620 million dollar Mega Resort is the
first built in Las Vegas in 15 years it
commands attention in the opening of The
Mirage set a trend that would be
followed for the next decade a genius
marketing move for a time before
smartphones and digital cameras but more
on that in a minute when the property
next door came up for sale when
purchased the land to develop a
family-friendly Resort which became the
Treasure Island since Cirque did so well
in the back parking lot of the Mirage
years before a custom-built theater was
constructed and when it opened in 1993
mystere became the first resident Cirque
act in Las Vegas's history the opening
of these properties brought something
entirely new not just through the inside
of Las Vegas properties but also to the
outside as when constructed giant free
shows for anyone to stop and see that
ran on regular schedules The Mirage
Volcano shot Flames into the night sky
while swashbuckling pirates dueled with
swords and pyrotechnics at the Treasure
Island all part of a word of mouth
advertising campaign to draw people to
the properties and entice them inside
again in a world before YouTube tiktok
and Facebook free publicity was hard
defined and Wynn had found the magic
recipe win's next resort was set to open
in 1998 but before this the cracks in
his clean Casino Mogul Persona started
to show in 1997 a lawsuit against Wynn's
company Mirage Resorts alleged that wind
told cocktail servers that they were too
overweight to serve drinks at the
property quote he said lose the fat lose
the flab and lose the ass he slapped his
own ass before walking out the server at
the time who was five foot seven inches
tall and 148 pounds told the media she
was not alone a group of women allege
the same treatment but for when this was
just the start of a string of
allegations that would plague him in
more recent years unfazed the domination
over Vegas would continue Bellagio is
advertising itself as having the very
best and restaurants and shops right as
we mentioned earlier in this hour This
was meant to be an aesthetic experience
for everyone who comes here Steve win's
goal here really to raise the bar he
wanted to attract tourist wanna that
maybe perhaps would skip Las Vegas they
might have thought it's a little too
tacky for them they'd go to Rome or to
Paris or to London well he really wants
to attract that high-end visitor the
visitor here and after selling his
company Mirage resorts to MGM Grand
Incorporated for a 6.6 billion dollars
in June of 2000 he purchased the Desert
Inn took his company Wynn Resorts public
in 2002 and officially became a
billionaire in 2004 doubling his net
worth from 650 million to 1.3 billion
dollars the win was built to replace the
Desert Inn and upon opening in 2005 it
became the largest privately funded
construction project in the nation's
history at 2.7 billion dollars with a
personal success came straight on his
marriage by the late part of the early
2000s Steve and his wife Elaine who
helped run his company were seeing
trouble signs in their relay ship but
undeterred wind opened its final Las
Vegas property The Encore on December
22nd 2008. three years ago I stood over
there introducing you to win Las Vegas
now I'm following it up the best way I
know how
this is Encore
[Music]
it was in 2010 that Stephen is first and
second wife Elaine would finally divorce
for good with Elaine staying on as a
director with his company board until
2015 and Steve remarrying in just 2011
in a ceremony where else but at the Wynn
Las Vegas and throughout his life when
has been embroiled in multiple lawsuits
between book publishers claiming he had
mafia ties to the creator of Girls Gone
Wild first over Chuck fraud and then
defamation of character he even was
accused by the United States government
for acting as a foreign agent without
properly registering in China but it was
in 2018 when for the first time when
faced a battle that it would seem even
he might not be able to win a battle
with allegations of insectual it was
then in 2018 when the Wall Street
Journal first broke the story a
manicurist who earlier was paid 7.5
million dollars settlement to remain
silent who had accused win of whipping
her following a manicure this was
followed by a 20 million dollar fine
from the Nevada state gaming commission
for completely ignoring these
allegations in a timely manner in the
first place the allegations were quite
severe multiple women alleging a pattern
of misconduct spanning decades
accusations ranging from Simply leering
at women using inappropriate language
and forcing sex to happen on demand to
even more bizarre stories of having
specially trained German Shepherds who
only responded to German commands
present to intimidate these women into
compliance The Wall Street Journal spoke
to 150 people that all seemed to have
the same type of story rampant abusive
power severe temper and a man who made
you scared to speak out for fear that
you would never get another job working
in the casino industry in Nevada or
anywhere else for that matter this
combined with a federal lawsuit filed in
2018 by former Salon manager at the win
who accused win of firing and
blacklisting her from work after she
came forward in 2006 led to win stepping
down from the company bearing his own
namesake His official resignation came
February 6 of 2018 when he announced
that he would be cutting ties and moving
on
now until the courts have their say all
of these allegations are simply
accusations made by people and this
video is not casting any sort of Doubt
on the alleged victims or on the
Innocence or guilt of when as it stands
now Steve Nguyen is until proven guilty
still innocent his namesake Towers over
skylines around the world and regardless
of what happens when the judge has their
say he was still a Visionary that helped
build Las Vegas bring the casino gaming
industry into Focus as a legitimate
business and left a decidedly positive
mark on the business forever and as for
that Revenge the wind Corporation
ultimately purchased the site of the New
Frontier where Steve himself was forced
to sell all those years earlier the land
where the casino once sat is Barren but
the fence around the property it's
emblazoned with the signature of the man
who came to Vegas all those years ago
and tried to own a piece of it my name
is Steven and if you're just browsing

1497 and the British Empire didn't exist
neither did Britain England was the
largest and most powerful country in the
British Isles at this time Wales the
Isle of Man and the peace of Ireland
could the pale were firmly under English
control the rest of Ireland was mostly
independent only giving lip service to
the English monarchy and in the north
Scotland remained independent a close
ally of France King Henry the seventh of
England wish to improve England's
trading situation the English were not
exactly renowned sailors at this point
and so Henry did what everyone else did
at the time hired an Italian a certain
Giovanni kobato
kobato was searching for a northern
route to China but landed in North
America becoming the first European to
set foot there at least since the
Vikings had five hundred years earlier
Henry the seventh continued the long
tradition of English monarchs and died
before being succeeded by his son Henry
the eighth Henry the eighth contributed
to the expansion of English holdings by
incorporating Wales into the kingdom of
England and giving it representation in
Parliament
in 1534 Henry split with Rome creating
the Church of England which would begin
the religious divide between England and
Ireland eight years later he had himself
declared the king of Ireland although in
reality this didn't change very much
Henry was succeeded by Edward and
shortly after that came Queen Mary the
first a Catholic who married king philip
ii of spain one important part of mary's
rule with the beginning of the irish
plantations which sure lands belonging
to irish law was confiscated and given
to the English for settlement Mary and
Philippe never had children and so after
Mary's death in 1558 the crown passed to
her sister Elizabeth because the English
Parliament made sure Philippe was
ineligible Elizabeth was a devout
Protestant and reinstated many of her
father's laws which punish Catholics
much to the anger of Philip who saw
himself as the defender of Catholicism
Spain held the Netherlands at this point
and the northern part which is a large
Protestant population was rebelling
against Spanish rule England was more
than happy to help undermine Spain's
power and one way the English helped the
Dutch was by giving Dutch privateers
shelter in English ports so privateers
were essentially pirates who had the
protection of a government and Elizabeth
employed many Spain had a growing
colonial empire at this point and there
was a lot of trade particularly in
silver between Spain and its colonies
privateers would seize this cargo by
raiding Spanish ports and ships before
taking it back to England the most
famous of England's privateers is Sir
Francis Drake who conducted numerous
highly profitable raids against the
Spanish he also circumnavigated the
globe and even claimed land
what is now California beyond private is
England also sent explorers to the new
world such as Sir Walter Raleigh who set
up a soon to be mysteriously abandoned
colony at Roanoke Island in North
America Elizabeth also continued Irish
plantations to shore up the English
position their exploration and
colonization at this time was almost
always reliant some royal patronage in
order to get funded English Spanish
relations were not improved by England's
moves across the Atlantic since been
claimed nearly all of the new world and
also losing silver was presumably not
much fun for Philippe either relations
worsened when Portugal England's oldest
ally had a succession crisis which saw
Philippe crowned its king the final
straw for Philippe was when Elizabeth
had Mary the Queen of Scots beheaded in
1587 the reasons for this are complex
but it was essentially because Elizabeth
did not want Scotland returning to
Catholicism so Philippe now pretty fed
up ordered the creation of an armada
which was to sail to the Netherlands
before invading England when the Amada
reached England several skirmishes
occurred the most famous being the
Battle of the Gravelines were an English
victory forced the Spanish fleet to sail
around the British Isles in order to
return to Spain storms a lack of food
and disease caused thousands on the
return journey in this failure pretty
much bankrupted Spain the next year
England chose to counter-attack and
launch the English Armada under the
command of Sir Francis Drake the goals
of the Armada were to destroy the
remaining Spanish ships the revolt in
Portugal and intercept any Spanish
Silber so the English Armada was a
complete failure and cost the lives of
thousands of English sailors and was
very expensive it did however guarantee
that England would remain independent
towards the end of her reign Elizabeth
made one last contribution to the Empire
and founded the East India Company which
was given a monopoly on trade with India
Elizabeth died childless in 1603 and was
succeeded by James the sixth of Scotland
who was crowned James the first of
England changes early reign saw the end
of the war with Spain and was marked by
several attempts to kill him most
notably the Gunpowder Plot James
contributed to the empire by sponsoring
colonial ventures he sponsored another
way for plantations in Ireland most
notably the Ulster plantation which
contained many Scottish settlers
alongside English ones
James also oversaw the first permanent
English settlement in the Americas the
colony at Jamestown next was Bermuda
followed by Plymouth which was famously
founded by the Puritans who arrived from
the Mayflower
so Jamestown was founded by the Virginia
Company of London with the goal of
making its shareholders a profit the
colony was famously led by John Smith
who maintained good relations
with the Native Americans Smith was
forced to return to England after being
injured in a gunpowder explosion and
4-time relations between the English and
the natives remained peaceful these good
relations wouldn't last and soon the
English and natives were fighting and
after several wars the English managed
to push the natives out of the area in
order to grow the cash crops on which
the colony relied indentured servants
were imported in this context indentured
servants were people who sold themselves
into a form of servitude for a period in
order to pay for their voyage to the New
World
indentured servants were soon replaced
with slaves from Africa since there was
no obligation to free them and they were
easier to obtain Indian raids against
the colony and rebellions against
neglectful rule made it very difficult
to make a profit and the colony was
turned over to the English crown there
were many reasons for colonial expansion
there was a strong desire to proselytize
and convert the natives of the new word
which many believed would civilize them
some undertook extremely expensive
voyages of discovery but the most common
reason was money Spain and Portugal had
amassed huge worth trading with their
colonies in China and England didn't
need much convincing cash crops such as
tobacco and sugar were extremely
profitable and even more money could be
made on the return voyages via the sale
of slaves to the new world the Atlantic
triangle is his home another reason was
security the money from trade as well as
large overseas populations loyal to the
crown provided extra manpower and money
for Wars to support the slave trade
England established forts along the
coast of Africa from which they operated
trading goods for gold ivory and people
slaves from Africa were also much easy
to obtain them the indentured servants
which came from England Ireland or
Scotland this was because of the
numerous major upheavals across the
British Isles such as the English Civil
War which saw the British Isles briefly
become a republic under Oliver Cromwell
the Irish capitalized in a weakened
English state and broke away from
English rule Cromwell brutally and
swiftly put down these rebellions and
seized huge chunks of land and gave it
to his veterans during the Civil War the
colonies generally sided with the
monarchy leading the English
Commonwealth to blockade some of them
Crom will briefly went to war with Spain
who ceded Jamaica which would form the
backbone of England sugar and slave
trades so long story short chromo died
in the monarchy was restored under
charles ii who in terms of empire
managed to gain new amsterdam from the
dutch which was swiftly renamed to new
york
the monarchy would soon find itself in
trouble again when Charles's son james a
second converted to Catholicism
Protestantism
was not too pleased about this and so
some lords asked the Dutch William of
Orange to become King of England which
he did in 1688 William's ascendancy to
the throne cost a major French supported
uprising in Ireland which was eventually
quashed Scotland also tried its hand at
colonisation during the period why
foundling Nova Scotia and modern-day
Canada which was quickly lost to the
French the most notorious attempt at
Scottish Empire building was the
founding of the colony at Caledonia and
what is now Panama in 1698 which was
claimed by Spain the colony failed due
to disease in a Spanish blockade and the
English refused to help because they
didn't want to provoke war
what makes Caledonia so notable was the
cost of its failure since the venture
had cost Scotland almost a fifth of its
national wealth and bankrupted the
kingdom thus the Scottish in English
empires at the turn of the 18th century
looked like this
in return for England financing
Scotland's debts both kingdoms were
unified by the 1707 act of Union which
gave birth to Great Britain Great
Britain immediately found itself caught
up in numerous European Wars from the
War of the Spanish Succession Britain
gained Gibraltar in southern Spain and
large swaths of French territory in
Canada next came the War of the Austrian
succession which wasn't very important
to Empire except that it paved the way
for a much more important war the Seven
Years War the Seven Years War was a
global conflict which saw British
victory and saw the transfer of a great
deal of North American territory to
Britain from France and Spain it should
be noted here that for many of these
countries the wars were nothing more
than excuses to seize each other's
territories the war also spread to India
where the British and French were trying
to squeeze each other out the reason for
this was the trade with India was
incredibly lucrative it focused mainly
on textile spices and the most important
consumer good of all time T so by the
beginning of the Seven Years War the
East India Company had already
established factories along the
coastline of India much of which was
controlled by either the Mughal or
Maratha empires the company was largely
independent and even had its own
military the company was also deeply
involved in Indian politics and were
very good at playing Indian Lords called
Nawabs off of each other for British
benefit robert clive also known as clive
of india led the East India Company
forces there the British won a decisive
victory against the Indians at the
Battle of Plassey he mostly due to some
double-dealing after defeating the
French the Dutch and later the Mughals
British territory in India looked like
this
Bengal was particularly important since
had a taxable population twice the size
of Britain after the Wars the company
began to levy heavy
is against the Localism bengal quickly
became an extremely important revenue
stream for britain robert clive was for
a short period the governor of Bengal
and one of his policies was to force
local farmers to grow opium for export
to China instead of food which meant
that whenever crops failed large numbers
of Bengali people starved Britain's
colonial successes in India were
contrasted by its failings in north
america the number of soldiers tax
disputes and lack of representation in
the British Parliament led the 13
colonies to declare their independence
the Americans were led by General George
Washington who would later become the
first President of the United States of
America Britain at first was able to win
some major victories but after years of
attrition alongside the French and
Spanish aiding the Americans the British
accepted American independence and lost
all of this territory the birth of the
British Empire was a slow and drawn-out
process the reasons for Cloney expansion
were diverse ranging from religious
calling to the desire for wealth
colonial failure led to the creation of
Great Britain but colonial success meant
the warfare now had a global scope and
it became increasingly difficult for the
rest of the world to stay uninvolved
from European politics I hope you
enjoyed this video and thank you for
watching

today it's well known that by April 1945
most of the Nazi leadership found
themselves cut off and surrounded by
Massive Soviet forces in Berlin
amongst them were Adolf Hitler and his
soon-to-be wife Eva Brown
neither would Escape
but what really happened in those Final
hours and where did the drama unfold
in this short video we'll use all the
latest available technology and mapping
techniques to pinpoint to the very meter
where Hitler's bunker lay and what
passed there in the final days of his
life
[Music]
first off we need to head to Berlin and
the central or Zed Zone as it was known
to the city's Defenders
this is the area in which a mixture of
die-hard Nazis and reluctant old men and
young boys found themselves fighting for
their lives once the Noose had closed
around the capital
included in this Central area with a
famous reichstag rice chancelloric
goring's air Ministry and of course the
fury bunker itself
for students of this period it's
generally understood that the fury
bunker was located under this rather
non-descript car park and that Hitler
committed suicide and his body was
burned in this vicinity but where
exactly did that happen
the first key piece of evidence in
finding the exact location of the fury
bunker comes from wartime schematics
created for the building of the bunker
in 1944. it shows a two-level complex
the upper part named the vorbonca and
the lower part the fura bunker
with dozens of rooms protected by meters
of reinforced concrete and
state-of-the-art gas protection it was a
formidable structure
now we know from records that the
vorbunker pre-existed the fury bunker
was used as an air raid shelter until
1943.
it was located directly beneath the old
rice Chancellor in the heart of Berlin's
government quarter and made up around 16
small cell-like rooms which included
storage for luggage Provisions a
generator toilets a canteen and several
small accommodation rooms which would be
taken over by the Goebbels family in
late April
the fury bunker itself came as a later
addition completed in 1944 two meters
deeper and linked to the war bunker by a
single passageway
one of the most Junior Personnel in the
bunker at that time was radio operator
rocus Mich
he described his first impression of the
fury bunker in detail
Donald last couple of steps and finally
we were the Deep bunker Hitler's Banker
Suite
construction work had begun far too late
and it was not ready having not dried
out
because of the remaining dump on the
wall it smelled stale
I looked around and screwed up my eyes
getting accustomed only slowly to the
harsh light of the naked lump bolts
how minute everything was how sad
unready unworthy
the rice post technician explains the
division of the rooms to me
they were no more than cells the
corridor was only 50 meters long and
divided into two halves by a concrete
bulkhead and a door
on the left was firefighting equipment
and on the other wall a long narrow
table with chairs
white at the end was another bulkhead
behind which was an emergency axis into
the Rice kansfly Garden
in the first room on the right of the
corridor technician hair show worked at
his machinery
a diesel generator and various pumps
which supplied fresh water
opposite the Machinery room on the left
side where the so-called red rooms a
bathroom and toilets immediately
adjoining hand Shields was my room with
a telephone switchboard which was
without the door and opened to the whole
floor
as well as the telephone room there were
four others
first one came to an anti-room with a
table and four chairs on the left hand
side
from this room it was possible to access
another room occupied by Dr Morel and
later Goebbels
to the right the corridor went down to
linger's room and the surgery and
dressing station
zenwon reached Hitler's rooms
the first one on the left LED
immediately into a Lobby from there one
went left into a womb intended as
Hitler's dressing room but which was
taken by IFA Brown
the lobby led him to Hitler's study and
living rooms even these rooms were only
3.5 by 3.2 meters in size
in the living room a sofa and three
chairs were squashed together
the big furniture pieces made the room
look cramped
from here one turned white into Hitler's
bedroom with a bed in the far corner
on the other side one crossed a small
floor into a red room with toilet and
shower
then reached ifa's room
here photoshell lamps hung from the
ceiling
from the central Corridor the second
door led into the map room which in the
final weeks military situation
conferences were held
despite its tightness
after my first two of the bunker I was
greatly relieved to step out into the
garden through the emergency exit
I began to sense what it meant to have
to ensure this over a long period of
time and also realize that for me such a
time was Dawning
as we heard the whole complex was pretty
uninspiring perpetually damp concrete
walls sparse Furnishing tightly enclosed
rooms no natural light and the constant
hum of generators and pumps made life
highly unpleasant for those in the
bunker including Hitler who by mid-april
would descend and with the exception of
a few short trips to the surface would
remain underground for the rest of his
life
so how do we find out exactly where this
bunker was with real accuracy
the first step lies in Wartime aerial
photographs taken by the allies during
flights over Berlin in March 1945.
this photograph of the central
government District highlights many key
buildings the air Ministry the old and
new reichs chancellery the Brandenburg
gate the spray River and the reichstag
these we can use as sort of signpost to
accurately identify the spot
one of the problems in finding the fewer
bunker at post-war Berlin is that the
city was so badly damaged in 1945 that
many buildings were pulled down and much
of the road layout changed when the city
was rebuilt but some of those major
markers still exist and we know haven't
moved
so let's take modern Berlin and compare
it to the 1945 aerial to recreate
Hitler's government quarter as it looked
at the time
this isn't that simple either we need to
know that the original photograph
perspective is correct
satellite images are generally fine
they're taken from a height of around
450 kilometers so we know the imagery is
straight down but wartime aerial photos
taken at a much lower level are often
slightly oblique an error of just a
fraction of a degree can throw out an
actual positioning by hundreds of meters
at the least so we need to triangulate
that is to say highlight key positions
in Berlin on all corners of this map and
compare them to the modern imagery so
let's try it
these are great markers the bridge over
the river spray to the north of the
reichstag which still exists in the same
spot as in 1945. this corner of the
reichstag building which again we know
hasn't changed here a distinctly shaped
building on the same road which leads to
the old reich's chancery
and we can see that each of these
locations matches with the 1945 image
with a good degree of accuracy and that
further to the South the edge of the
famous potsdammer Platt also fits as it
should telling us that the wartime image
perspective is accurate and therefore
our overlay is correct too
so we know that works let's zoom into
the government headquarters District
here we can see that in the post-war
years those famous government buildings
have almost all been replaced with
blocks of flats restaurants a children's
play area and most notably a car park
this we know is broadly the area where
the reichs chancellor is to be found in
1945.
one problem with actually finding the
bunker is pretty obvious it's
underground which makes aerial
reconnaissance of limited use but we do
know from this contemporary image of the
bunker that a few parts of the complex
remained above ground namely an
observation tower with a distinctive
ConEd roof and a squared emergency exit
into the rice chancellery Gardens
it's not easy to do with 1945 quality
photographs but we can actually identify
these key objects right here on the map
the Tower and the building are both just
about visible and give us a good
guideline as to where the bunker was
now to add the bunker complex itself
using those two above ground points we
can blend out the historic map and
identify the spots directly beneath on
the modern ground
by marking these two key locations on
the modern view we have at least two
accurate points of reference including
the distance between them which gives us
the scale
but to triangulate we need a third this
is a bit more difficult we need to
consult this excellent 3D plan of both
the bunker and the old Chancery Hall to
achieve it
we can see here that the bunker complex
actually starts directly beneath the
hull and we can see that on the aerial
so by taking common points at the edge
of the building and marking those on the
new map we can triangulate the exact
position of the bunker
now we repeat the same process embedding
our specially drawn bunker plan into the
modern map to identify the exact
location with real certainty of exactly
where the fura bunker lay
interestingly it's slightly further
south than many people suppose towards
the southern end of the car park and
slightly under a block of flats but
still in the same vicinity
and so it was right here in late April
that Hitler and Eva Brown met their end
but can we use this same mapping to
track those events
eyewitness testimony tells us that by
the end of April Hitler had finally
admitted he was not going to be leaving
Berlin alive and that the war was lost
which In fairness had been obvious to
everybody except him apparently for many
months Eva Brown too knew this and
seemingly had come to Berlin with the
express purpose of dying alongside
Hitler
to many people's surprise though and
notary was called and made a perilous
journey through Berlin to reach the
bunker it was here just after midnight
on the 29th of April that Hitler and Eva
Brown married with either famously
beginning to sign her surname Brown
before Crossing it out and writing
Hitler instead
unsurprisingly it wasn't much of a
honeymoon with the Newlywed spending a
little time with the last remaining
residents of the bunker including Mr and
Mrs Goebbels and their six young
children in fact the Hitler's the best
man the witnesses and even the notary
who performed the marriage would all be
dead within days
by late on the 29th Russian guns were
pounding the government district and
Soviet tanks were less than a kilometer
away from the bunker around 2 A.M on the
30th Hitler summoned his secretary
Charles younger to whom he dictated his
last will and testament appointing
Admiral Karl dernitz as the new
president of Germany on the 30th of
April Hitler called his adjutant Otto
guncher and valet Heinz linger and
informed them of his and Eva's plans to
commit suicide
with news of the public display and
maltreatment of Mussolini's body the day
before in Italy Hitler was desperate to
escape the same undignified fate and so
issued orders that the vehicles in the
nearby garage were to be drained of
their fuel and their bodies burned after
death originally it was believed that
Hitler intended to poison himself using
cyanide Supply by Heinrich Himmler
though when Hitler learned that Himmler
had been secretly discussing peace terms
with the Allies he feared betrayal and
that the poison Himmler had given him
would not be effective so instead he
tried it on his beloved dog Blondie
it worked
some short time later after assembling
the remaining staff and saying their
goodbyes to their Inner Circle Hitler
and Ava made their way to this small
damp room in the fury bunker where
sitting on a couch Ava bit down on a
cyanide capsule whilst Hitler
simultaneously shot himself in the head
with his wealth of pistol
a few minutes later linger alongside
Martin Borman cautiously opened the door
to find Ava her lips purple from the
cyanide on the couch with her legs drawn
up around her and Hitler by her side
killed by a gunshot to the temple
linger described what happened next
while Poorman went outside to fetch help
I spread out the blankets laid the
bodies upon them and wrapped them around
Ava Hitler was carried out first Borman
picked her up in his arms and brought
the body over to the room where air his
camper took over because he did not like
the idea of the man she had despised in
life now carrying her to the Grave I
reached below Hitler's head two officers
from his bodyguard lifted the body
wrapped in a gray blanket and we carried
him out
records tell us that those carrying the
bodies travel through the fury bunker
and exit via this doorway and that they
entered the badly shelled rice Chancery
Gardens where they found a showhole in
which to place the bodies here's linger
again
immediately in front of the bunker door
in the chancellory garden his body was
lit next to ethos in a small depression
but gasoline was poured over the bodies
and an attempt was made to set them a
night at first this proved impossible as
there was a fierce wind circulating I
returned to the back and made a sixth
spell from some signal papers Walmart
knitted and sued onto Hitler's petrol's
hook body which caught fire immediately
standing by the banker entrance we the
last Witnesses raised our hand for a
last Hitler's salute
so where exactly did this take place
by turning the clock forward from our
map we can reveal modern day Berlin and
very likely the exact spot where Ava and
Hitler's bodies were burned which is
rather fittingly in a totally
unremarkable Road Junction next to a
non-descript street in Central Berlin
with news of Hitler's death spreading
many in the bunker later reported
feeling like a spell had been broken
an individually or in groups most began
to flee vainly hoping to escape the fast
approaching Soviets most wouldn't make
it
the Goebbels family were an exception
having murdered their six children in
their beds with cyanide on the 1st of
May they too headed to this same area of
the Chancery Gardens
where Goebbels drew his pistol shot his
wife and then himself
the pair also being burned in the show
hole
Joseph and Magda goebel's bodies would
later be positively identified through
the device Goebbels War for his club
foot which was found amongst the charred
remains
the goebbel's children wouldn't be found
for another two days still in their beds
in the bunker
within 24 hours of Hitler's death the
Russians had captured the reichstag at
all meaningful defense in Central Berlin
ceased shortly thereafter
and the race to find Hitler began
shrouded in controversy and secrecy to
this day it was unclear as to where and
when Hitler's remains were discovered
but it was likely about five days later
by Soviet troops who kept it a secret
from the Western allies in fact Stalin
claimed they'd not found him at all and
this spawned a long persistent myth that
Hitler may have escaped the encirclement
of Berlin and fled to safety location
unknown
the reality is far less dramatic Hitler
was found and his almost completely
burned remains identified relatively
quickly
one of the few remnants to survive the
fire were Hitler's teeth and part of his
lower jaw
very quickly the Soviets found Hitler's
dentist's assistant and got her to
sketch from memory a plan of hit as
extensive and almost unique dental work
which perfectly matched The Remains
discovered in the chancellory gardens
not only that but gunsha linger Mish his
chauffeur kemka and several other
Witnesses all saw Hitler's body were
part of the group that burned it and
were subject to brutal interrogation by
the Soviets about the events for years
afterwards had there been another
version it would have certainly come out
at the time
what's more even after repatriation to
the West all the witnesses continue to
tell the same story The Myth though and
it is a myth persisted with sightings
the theories around Hitler's Escape
continuing to this day
so did a seriously ill Hitler even
remotely possibly escape the bunker in
Berlin well unless there's a tunnel
under this spot leading directly to
South America he didn't and even if
there was he didn't take his teeth with
him and a large portion of his jaw both
of which today reside in a Moscow
archive
so what became of the bunker itself as
we know the Soviets captured and
retained control of Berlin at the end of
the war and when the city was later
divided into four the bunker remained
just inside the Soviet zone
some attempts were made to destroy the
remnants and above ground sections were
destroyed when Redevelopment finally
took place in the 1990s some parts of
the bunker were uncovered and a few
Berlin residents even managed to make
their way inside and capture some rare
photographs before those visible
remnants were destroyed or filled in by
work Crews it's likely though not
certain that even to this day parts of
the bunker complex still exist
relatively intact beneath this spot in
Berlin
and so this unassuming location today
still May retain some of its history
albeit out of sight to those who walk
these streets and maybe that's how it
should be
personally I think it's fitting that the
end of one of the world's most horrific
regimes and the man responsible for it
is largely unremembered here
and the only a Stones throw away lies a
powerful Memorial commemorating millions
of those he put to death
this should be obvious but to clarify
the idea behind this video of course is
not to commemorate an individual or to
condone an ideology but simply to
highlight a location where at one time
and in one moment history came to pass
foreign

Here we are in the SpaceX machine shop.
When Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002, 
he only had two things going for him. 
  
SpaceX basically consisted of carpet and 
a mariachi band. That’s all of SpaceX.
Well, he did have one more thing: 
an ambition that knew no bounds. 
  
The sky is not the limit for Elon, 
whose mission is to send people to Mars.
On April 20, 2023 - humanity took 
one step closer to that dream.
When the world’s largest rocket, 
the fully reusable Starship,  
attempted to go into orbit for the first time.
Obviously, this isn’t a nominal situation.
Although Starship failed to reach orbit,  
learning from failures is Elon's 
approach to his career building SpaceX.
And to think he built a rocket 
company with just a bachelor’s  
degree in economics and another in physics.
Elon, who has Canadian citizenship thanks to 
his mother Maye, began his undergrad studies  
at Queen's University in Kingston, 
Ontario, three hours east of Toronto.
He chose Queen’s over Canada’s University 
of Waterloo, which is renowned for its  
engineering program, because, as he told 
Queen’s magazine, “there didn’t seem to be  
any girls (at Waterloo)! I didn’t want to spend 
my undergraduate time with a bunch of dudes.”
  
After two years at Queen’s, he transferred 
to the University of Pennsylvania as he  
thought attending an Ivy League school 
might help him land a job in America. 
  
The land of opportunity when it comes to tech.  
  
Still, degrees in economics and physics 
weren’t enough to make him a rocket scientist.
So, Elon taught himself by 
devouring these books. 
  
A habit he built as a boy,  
reading the entire Encyclopedia when 
he was only eight or nine years old.
He also absorbed knowledge 
from the industry’s best.
He cold-called aerospace consultant Jim 
Cantrell who answered while driving in  
his convertible with the roof down. 
He thought he heard Elon introduce  
himself as an “Internet billionaire”, as 
he recalled in an interview with Esquire.
  
Elon wasn’t quite a billionaire then, 
but he did score $180 million when his  
financial services company X.com merged 
with PayPal, which was bought by eBay. 
  
He then sunk EVERYTHING into three projects: 
$100 million into SpaceX, $70 million into Tesla,  
and $10 million into solar energy company 
SolarCity, which later merged with Tesla.
In 2001, he planned on buying 
a refurbished intercontinental  
ballistic missile (ICBM) from the 
Russians to use as a launch vehicle.
He figured his space ambitions could  
start with sending some mice to Mars. 
 
When he went to Moscow to negotiate, the  
Russians wanted $8 million per ICBM, 
twice what Elon was prepared to pay. 
 
  
When he countered with $8 million for two rockets, 
Jim Cantrell recalled in Ashlee Vance’s biography  
on Elon, that the Russians reportedly 
“‘said something like, ‘Young boy. No”.
Elon apparently “stormed out of the meeting.”
 
On the flight home, he broke down the cost  
of building and launching a 
rocket on a spreadsheet. 
  
He realized a modest-sized rocket 
that could carry smaller satellites  
and research payloads into space 
could be much less than $8 million. 
  
So, SpaceX was born with the goal 
of building its own rockets. 
  
It is an understatement to say 
starting a rocket company is hard. 
  
But Elon found an ally in the godfather 
of rocket science, Tom Mueller.
Tom worked for the large 
aerospace company TRW at the time,  
which Northrop Grumman later acquired.  
 
He spent weekends building and firing rockets  
in the Mojave Desert in California 
as part of an amateur rocket club. 
  
The amateur rocket scene was tight, 
and Tom got introduced to Elon.
  
Tom designed the Merlin engine 
that powers SpaceX’s rockets.  
  
Merlin revolutionized spaceflight 
as it’s designed to be re-used.
Elon understood that the only way to open up space  
to everyone was to drastically cut 
costs by building reusable rockets.
The Falcon 9 is partially re-usable 
as the booster lands back on earth.
Before the Falcon 9, there was the Falcon 1.
The Falcon 1 attempted to reach orbit 
for the first time in March 2006. 
  
It lasted only 41 seconds in the air 
before crashing due to a fuel leak. 
  
The second attempt the following 
year went slightly better,  
but the rocket failed to reach 
orbit due to a chain of issues  
caused by an unexpected bump when the 
first and second stages separated. 
  
Third time wasn’t a charm, either, as a 
timing error caused the two stages to collide.
Elon had run through all the 
money he had set aside for SpaceX.
When you had that third failure in a row, 
did you think, "I need to pack this in"? 
Never.
Why not? 
I don't ever give up. I mean, I'd have 
to be dead or completely incapacitated.
He told his employees to keep going.
The then head of talent acquisiition 
at SpaceX, Dolly Singh, recalled on  
the question-and-answer site Quora, Elon 
said: “...we need to pick ourselves up,  
and dust ourselves off, because we 
have a lot of work to do. Then he said,  
with as much fortitude and ferocity 
as he could muster…“"For my part,  
I will never give up and I mean never,” and 
that if we stick with him, we will win.”
“I think most of us would have followed him 
into the gates of hell carrying suntan oil  
after that. It was the most impressive display 
of leadership that I have ever witnessed.”
  
While Elon tried to save SpaceX, 
Tesla was hanging on by a thread.
He joined Tesla in its infancy 
after sinking millions from his  
PayPal earnings and stepped into the 
role as the company’s board chair.
After numerous management changes,  
he was left in charge as CEO in late 2008 
at a time when Tesla was in serious trouble.
The production of the first vehicle, the 
sporty Roadster, went wayyy over budget. 
  
By October 2008, Tesla had just $9 
million left to fund the company.
  
It was hard to convince investors to 
fork over millions more during the  
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
His personal life fared no better; he was 
going through a divorce from his first wife,  
Justine, with whom he shares triplets and twins. 
  
Elon has said 2008 was the 
worst year of his life. 
  
With SpaceX unable to get its rocket into 
orbit and Tesla nearly running out of cash,  
it looked like one or both of his companies would 
die, as he painfully recalled to Ashlee Vance: 
  
"I could either pick SpaceX or Tesla or split 
the money I had left between them. If I split  
the money, maybe both of them would die. 
If I gave the money to just one company,  
the probability of it surviving was greater, 
but then it would mean certain death for the  
other company. I debated that over and over."
 
It was like having to choose between two children.
Perhaps his difficult childhood 
shaped his never-give-up mentality.
  
He was bullied for years when he was 
growing up in Pretoria, South Africa. 
  
One day in eighth or ninth grade, he and 
his brother Kimbal were sitting on the  
top of a flight of stairs eating when a boy 
snuck up behind him, kicked him in the head,  
and shoved him down the stairs. Then a 
bunch of boys beat him until he blacked out.
The beating damaged his nose so severely 
that it restricted airflow, and he later got  
surgery to correct his deviated septum. 
 
His life at home was no less painful.
  
After his parents divorced, Elon opted 
to live with his father for a time. 
 
  
But he told Rolling Stone that his dad 
Errol “...was such a terrible human being.  
You have no idea. My dad will have a carefully 
thought-out plan of evil. He will plan evil.”
Elon found comfort in coding, sometimes 
programming throughout the night. 
  
At age twelve, he coded a space-themed 
video game called Blastar. A South  
African magazine published the 
source code and gave him $500.
  
The game was no marvel of computer programming, 
but it did hint at his underlying brilliance.  
  
He turned his science fiction fantasies into 
reality when he founded SpaceX at the age of 30.
Despite three failed flight 
attempts, an investment from  
a venture capital firm made it possible 
for SpaceX to attempt a fourth flight. 
  
The future of SpaceX rested 
on that fourth launch in 2008.
On September 28, 2008, the Falcon 1 lifted off.
9 minutes 31 seconds after launch,  
the rocket…reached orbit. 
 
Sstage separation confirmed!
The success saved SpaceX because 
it helped secure a $1.6 billion  
contract from NASA to resupply cargo 
to the International Space Station. 
  
SpaceX was out of death’s reach. But 
Tesla was still within its grasp.
As Tesla was running out of money, Elon 
devised a plan to keep his company afloat:  
he cut 25% of the workforce and leaned 
on friends to cover the weekly payroll. 
  
He managed to scrape together 
$20 million, including money he  
made investing in his cousin’s data center 
startup, which Dell bought the year before.
  
Investors agreed to match whatever 
he was able to get on his own. 
  
This new round of $40 million in 
funding saved Tesla on Christmas Eve.
It was the last hour of the 
last day that it was possible”
  
Tesla would endure many more years of pain 
after going public in 2010 at $17 a share. 
  
Although the Model S wowed the 
world, people hesitated to buy the  
luxury vehicle after it came out in 2012.
 
Elon turned his employees into salespeople  
whose job was to convince everyone who put down a 
$5,000 deposit to go through with their purchase.
When orders weren’t coming in fast enough,  
Tesla said it was temporarily shutting 
down its factory for “maintenance” and  
kept the real reason secret to avoid spooking 
investors and sending the stock plummeting.
Elon’s maneuvering worked.
In 2013, Tesla stunned Wall Street 
by posting its first-ever profit.
Elon’s goal had always been to build 
a more affordable electric car.
But Tesla simply couldn’t keep 
up with demand for the Model 3. 
  
Frankly, we’re gonna be in production hell.
As the saying goes, if you’re 
going through hell, keep going.
  
Elon promised to produce 5,000 
Model 3s a week initially,  
yet only managed a mere 800 cars a 
week in the first few months of 2018.
Tesla was burning cash as it tried to increase 
the production of its most affordable car.
Elon says Tesla was about 
a month from bankruptcy.
  
The situation was so critical that he 
slept in his factories to save time,  
and, he also said it was to 
suffer more than his staff.
He told Bloomberg: “Whenever they felt 
pain, I wanted mine to be worse.” 
  
The pain eased as Tesla found a way to 
claw its way out of danger once again.
Tesla managed to increase production and 
turned the corner as it entered 2020.
It has expanded from one factory in Fremoba 
nt, California, to factories worldwide.
Tesla delivered 1.3 million cars in 2022.
One of them was my own.
As I drove across Canada last summer, 
I couldn’t help but think that one day,  
electric cars will be so run-of-the-mill 
that they’ll just be called…cars.
I did notice that supercharging stations 
across the country were pretty empty.
There was basically no one charging beside me.
Yet charging stations will soon be getting busier.
Many countries, including Canada, have mandated  
that all new cars and light-duty trucks 
sold be zero-emission vehicles by 2035.
Not to mention other auto companies will now be 
relying on Tesla’s charging network, like Ford.
Elon has stressed Tesla must make its cars fully  
autonomous in which there is 
no human intervention at all.
That’s really the difference 
between Tesla being worth a  
lot of money or being worth basically zero.
As Tesla engineers work to improve 
its full self-driving technology,  
it wants to place that technology in a robot.
Optimus perhaps felt like a sideshow 
when Tesla first unveiled it in 2021.
However:
Those who are insightful or who listen 
carefully will understand that Optimus  
ultimately will be worth more than the 
car business. Worth more than FSD. 
  
There’s been arguably even more skepticism  
over Elon’s plan to ease traffic by 
putting Teslas into his own tunnels.
We’re still years away from 
seeing whether the Boring  
Company’s tunnels will be a visionary 
mode of transportation or if there are  
too many holes in Elon’s plan - pun intended. 
 
It’s also too early to determine the potential  
of Neuralink, which received regulatory approval 
in May 2023 to test its brain implant on people.
Neuralink’s chip is meant to stimulate 
the brain and help those with spinal  
cord injuries control their computers 
and smartphones with their thoughts.
I think we have a chance, I emphasize a 
chance, of being able to allow somehow who  
cannot walk or use their arms 
to be able to walk again.
The long-term goal of Neuralink 
is to merge humans with AI.  
  
A common theme runs through all his companies.
The dream of freedom from Earth by going to  
Mars with the fully reusable Starship.
Freedom from fossil fuels. 
Freedom from traffic.
Freedom from the limitations of human biology.
And now Twitter is fighting for 
freedom of speech which he felt  
was being suppressed under previous leadership.
Twitter has changed its 
incorporated name to X Corp,  
to move toward Elon’s plan of transforming 
Twitter into X, the “everything app”.
That includes making Twitter 
a better video experience. 
You can now find my full videos 
on Twitter, plus exclusive tech  
insights I only share on Twitter. Catch me 
@Newsthink, or click the link in the description.
Although Elon has been building many 
of his companies for over a decade,  
their potential is only just starting to emerge.
Regardless of whether he succeeds 
or fails, he won’t give up. 
  
He once said, “When something is important enough,  
you do it even if the odds 
are not in your favor.”
  

wealth power and influence JP Morgan had
it all he owned the first billion dollar
company he dominated the country's most
profitable Industries and on multiple
occasions the economy of the United
States quite literally depended on the
actions of JP Morgan with a simple word
or the stroke of a pen he could save a
company from claps or Doom it to
bankruptcy hated by some admired by
others there will never be another man
quite like JP Morgan this is his story
uh
John Pierpont Morgan was born in
Connecticut in 1837 into privileged
circumstances John's father Junior
Spencer Morgan was already a wealthy
banker and he ensured that Jon had the
best education that money could buy
since he wanted John to follow in his
footsteps as a financier however despite
being born into wealth Jon's childhood
was Bleak he was a sickly child he
regularly suffered from brutal coughing
vets migraines seizures and various
diseases such as scarlet fever his
medical conditions meant he often
couldn't play outside with the other
kids instead you'd find him inside
studying or reading financial statements
in fact at one point John became
incapacitated by rheumatic fever and his
father's solution was to send Jon to
live by himself in the Azure islands in
the middle of the Atlantic Ocean his dad
believed the climate and salty air would
help Jon recover from his condition so
Jon stayed on that island for nearly a
year without any family and when he was
finally well enough he continued his
education by 1857 John had studied in
Boston Switzerland and Germany and was
now 19 years old and ready to enter the
workforce at this point John's father
was a junior partner at a london-based
merchant banking firm called George
Peabody and Co and thanks to his father
John was able to get a job on Wall
Street in the banking firm which looked
after Peabody's interest in America part
of John's job involved writing reports
to his father's firm detailing the
financial and political goings-on In
America which of course at the time was
still an Emerging Market however from an
early age John's father feared that his
son was too rash and hot-tempered to
ever become a successful financier and
that he needed to learn restraint and
responsibility one example of this was
in 1859 while on a trip to New Orleans
John made a seemingly Reckless gamble by
using company money to purchase an
entire shipment of Brazilian coffee that
arrived in Port without a buyer even
though John sold it and made a tidy
profit the senior members of the banking
house including John John Farber
couldn't stand this kind of risk-taking
so in 1861 age 24 John left the Safety
and Security of an established firm in
order to strike it out on his own
founding his own company which continued
to act as an agent for his father's Bank
back in England it was also that year
that John married his first love a frail
young woman named Amelia Sturgis and for
a brief period John was the happiest
he'd ever been however Amelia soon came
down with a persistent cough that was
later diagnosed as tuberculosis so right
after their wedding John took her on an
extended honeymoon in the Mediterranean
hoping that the new climate might
restore her strength just like Jon's
father had tried for him when he was
younger but it was no use Jon's wife
died just four months after their
wedding leaving John a widower at 24.
understandably he was an inconsolable
mess and it's believed he never truly
recovered from this tragic loss of his
wife at such a young age immediately
after losing her John threw himself deep
into his work more than ever however
whilst John was going through his own
crisis so was the United States around
this time the American Civil War had
broken out and the 1863 conscription act
should have meant Jon went off to fight
but he didn't instead John paid 300 to
be removed from enlisting and have a
substitute stand in his place that's not
to say John London get involved in the
war though in fact on the contrary he
profited from it hugely one of the most
notable examples was when he financed
the purchase of 5 000 Surplus Hall
carbine rifles a 3.50 each from the
government that were considered too old
to use but then the Consortium who
bought them made some minor adjustments
and almost immediately sought the same
rifles back to the government for 22
each it was an over 600 increase in
price and thus whilst it was a very
lucrative deal for Jon to be involved in
this war profiteering was certainly not
popular with the public or the
government but that was the least of his
worries Jon would soon be facing some
much bigger controversies
in 1871 John saw the golden opportunity
to team up with one of the leading
financiers in the country a banker named
Anthony Drexel together they founded the
Drexel Morgan and co-private Merchant
banking house which was later renamed to
Simply JP Morgan and Co and this would
be the firm that John would manage for
the rest of his life serving as the
precursor to the modern banking Titan we
know today as JPMorgan Chase now early
in John's career he'd mostly just been a
facilitator of deals like connecting
wealthy investors and Visionaries
together in exchange for occur the
profits but as John amassed a bigger
personal fortune and reputation he was
able to finance many of these projects
on his own and John had already
identified his first major investment
the American railroad system now at the
time most of the other big industries
were dominated by one single magnate
like Carnegie dominated in steel and
Rockefeller dominated an oil but the
railroads weren't monopolized actually
it was the opposite there were so many
competing companies that offered very
similar routes that they often slashed
their prices to try and win customers
but whereas most looked at the railroad
business and saw a fierce competition
John saw opportunity he felt the answer
was consolidation merging railroads
together rather than competing that's
because Jon knew that the bigger a
business got the more it could benefit
from economies of scale so John skull
was always to turn multiple small
companies into one unified conglomerate
suddenly rather than competing against
each other and driving down prices they
could set whatever prices they wanted as
they owned all the nearby railroads so
John invested heavily in multiple
railroads which he began consolidating
he'd take over under Finance railroad
companies streamline their management
and operational efficiency and merge the
small companies together into one
dominant player that could crush any
remaining competitors which of course
he'd then be able to take over as well
Jon used this tactic to such great
effect that it was even named after him
becoming known as morganization but the
other thing Jon did differently to other
businessmen and investors of the time
was that he played a very proactive role
in the corporate management of these
companies John wasn't content with
simply buying shares then sitting back
and raking in the profits he was a man
who craved control Jon needed to be the
one and calling the shots so he
regularly used his influential position
on the boards of directors to direct the
company as he saw fat he often
reshuffled the leaderships of all these
different Railway companies to his
liking and assembled them into
monopolies with himself at the head of
the table of course when railroad came
to him for help he'd refuse unless he
was given full control this not only
gave Jon the power he wanted but also
created a more stable industry which in
turn attracted even more Investments
money from Europe flowed into U.S
Railway companies now that it looked
more Consolidated and stable thanks to
Jon and this of course made John even
wealthier Jon kept acquiring more Rail
lines and constantly wanted to outdo his
previous achievements and be more
ambitious for example he purchased 250
000 shares of stock from William
Vanderbilt and one of the most prominent
Railways in the country the New York
Central Railroad he then took things
even further the following year when he
executed the largest transaction in
railroad bonds ever made in the United
States underwriting the sale of 40
million dollars in bonds to finance the
completion of the Northern Pacific
railroad before long john owned
one-third of all roads in America at a
time where sixty percent of America's
stock market capitalization consisted of
railroad companies in other words John
was no longer just a wealthy financier
he was literally shaping Railroad
conglomerates and being heavily involved
in reorganizations and mergers all of
which grew his power and wealth further
and his growing reputation as a
formidable Titan of industry was matched
by his intimidating appearance Jon had a
skin condition called rosacea that
inflamed and ruptured the blood vessels
of his nose making it very red and
disfigured whilst he also had
rhino-fimer which made his nose much
larger and covered in pimples John was
actually very self-conscious about his
appearance and got angry at being
photographed according to his grandson
whenever John had a portrait done he
always ordered them to redo his nose to
make it look more normal which is why
it's not as noticeable in pictures of
him but his startling facial features
combined with his towering height and
his aggressive way of speaking all meant
that Jon was an intimidating presence to
be around however in 1901 it seemed Jon
had finally met someone who would stand
up to him president Theodore Roosevelt
you see John had just Consolidated his
Northern Pacific railroad together with
two other Railways in the region and
created a massive new holding company
called the Northern Securities
Corporation and he'd been able to get
away with these kind of monopolistic
practices due to his close relationship
with the current President William
McKinley but then McKinley was
assassinated and suddenly Theodore
Roosevelt became president who took a
very different view on what John was
doing Roosevelt ordered the justice
department to file a suit against the
company for violating the Sherman
Antitrust Act of 1890 whilst John fought
this in court the company was ultimately
sped up and this was just the beginning
of a very tense relationship between the
two men when John Hood Roosevelt was
going to Africa one year John said good
I hope the first lion meets him does his
duty for John though this was merely a
small setback he was already planning
something much crazier
foreign
Carnegie steel was at its peak it
dominated the steel industry and was one
of the most valuable companies in the
country but despite it netting 40
million dollars a year Carnegie was
ready to retire and wanted to sell his
company but who could buy it that's
where John came in he basically told
Carnegie to name his price and he did
480 million dollars which would be more
than any other business deal in history
and yet John agreed on the spot and
later confessed he would have paid 100
million more John made the landmark
purchase in 1901 but this was just the
beginning of his ambitious plan he
merged Carnegie steel with the federal
Steel company and a few other businesses
to form U.S steel the world's first
billion dollar corporation which had a
market cap of 1.4 billion dollars just
to put that in perspective all the
manufacturing in the country was
capitalized at a combined 9 billion this
deal gave Jon control over roughly
two-thirds of the American steel
production so basically two of the
largest Industries at the time were
steel and railroads and Jon had
seemingly conquered both and he didn't
stop there John helped finance Thomas
Edison's early experiments with
electricity he then played an important
role in merging Edison Electric with its
competitors in order to create General
Electric and John was also influential
in creating what would later become a t
Jon's talents for combining companies
together and turning them into
Unstoppable Giants was unmatched but
unfortunately a crisis was about to
begin
in 1893 the United States was facing a
depression the likes of which he had
never seen before after several decades
of continued growth and unchecked
Investments the bubble burst and the
American economy was plunged into chaos
stocks plummeted losing almost half
their value thousands of business closed
their doors forever hundreds of banks
went bankrupt and unemployment rates
skyrocketed throughout the country the
crisis scared off Foreign investors who
cashed in their American Bonds in
exchange for gold slowly but surely
depleting the U.S reserves since at the
time the dollar was still tied to the
gold standard meaning anyone could
convert their paper money into physical
gold and thus had more confidence their
paper money was actually worth something
as a result the American government
always kept at least 100 million dollars
worth of gold bullion on hand to back
the dollar but by 1895 most of that gold
was gone and the dollar value was in a
sharp decline at its lowest the
government had no more than nine million
dollars worth of gold reserves which
meant that it was in danger of
defaulting on its loans at any moment
and of course this run on gold just
spread more Panic having a domino effect
where more investors pulled their money
out of the US and depleted the reserves
even further the US didn't have a
central bank at the time to rescue them
and the situation was extremely dire
President Cleveland understood this was
a Crossroads moment for America that
would forever alter its course the
traditional strategy of Simply selling
more bonds to the American people
wouldn't work fast enough John knew this
was the time for drastic and immediate
action so he traveled to Washington to
meet the president lay out his game plan
in order to bring America back from the
brink of an economic disaster John's
audacious scheme was to form a private
Syndicate consisting of the most
prominent Bankers in the country who
would work together with foreign
investors to shore up America's gold
reserves his Syndicate offered to
purchase 65 million dollars worth of
30-year gold bonds using 3.5 million
ounces of gold thanks to an old Civil
War statute President Cleveland could
agree to the deal right then and there
without having to wait for approval from
Congress once Cleveland signed the
agreement John wired his men in New York
and told them to act and in only 22
minutes they brought out all the gold
bonds Jon's decisive actions had an
immediate a calming effect on the
volatile Financial market and restored
faith in the economy John had almost
single-handedly saved them from Total
claps and of course being the shrewd
businessman that he was he had also made
a large profit from the Enterprise by
securing generous rates on the gold
bonds that he purchased unless whilst
John had saved the day and helped bail
out the government it also raised
concerns it Illustrated the vast
influence and power of one single Banker
on the entire U.S economy and some asked
whether his motivations were really
patriotic or simply opportunistic to
line his own Pockets at the next
election the relationship between big
Banks and the government was a hot topic
for the Democrats but John and his
Banker friends donated heavily to the
Republican nominee who won the election
instead so for now Jon kept his close
ties to the government but this was not
the only time that Jon was instrumental
in stabilizing the American economy in
1907 the country was facing another
deepening financial crisis which led to
several Banks being on the verge of
bankruptcy leading to hordes of people
queuing up around the block to withdraw
their money from their bank accounts the
government reportedly had to tell bank
tellers to deliberately count the money
slower to try and reduce the rate cash
was being withdrawn because if everyone
pulled their money out at the same time
it could be catastrophic by this point
Roosevelt was the president and as we
already know he certainly did not see
eye to eye with John on most things but
the crisis of 1907 was so dire that they
both agreed it would be in America's
best interest if the government and big
business worked together to save the
country from falling into a depression
so Roosevelt called on JP Morgan to
salvage the situation once again Jon's
strategy was to spend a lot of money
where it was needed most he summoned
dozens of the leading financiers and
leaders of the nation's biggest banks
and trusts to join him in his private
library on Madison Avenue and decide on
the best course of action John's planet
was essentially for them to invest in
their smaller competitors Jon concluded
that although some banks would
inevitably fail others could still be
saved so he and his associates deposited
giant sums of money in a number of banks
so that they would be able to pay their
depositors and avoid declaring
bankruptcy after revealing his plan John
then locked the door while the bankers
negotiate shaded among themselves
literally locking them in until they
agreed on a resolution by the morning
everyone had agreed with Jon's plan and
with Roosevelt's approval the U.S
treasury also contributed 25 million
showing the level of trust and respect
the president had for Jon's business
sense what's remarkable is that John was
70 years old at this point and
negotiated all of this whilst having a
terrible cold meaning he was constantly
coughing and sneezing while saving the
US economy but his plan ultimately
worked lots of capital was injected back
into the economy public confidence was
restored in America's banking system and
yet another economic disaster was
averted thanks to John's wheelings and
dealings but whilst he was once again
briefly labeled as a hero almost
immediately people began to realize just
how dependent they had become on one
single man something needed to change
now so far we've heard how JP Morgan
revolutionized the railroads which

John was facing increased scrutiny the
age of the robber baron who could
conduct his business unchecked and
unimpeded was slowly coming to an end as
the American public was growing
increasingly wary of a handful of
businessmen wielding so much power and
influence John was summoned to testify
before the pujo committee that wanted to
investigate the true reach of wall
Street's money trust and its role in the
American economy John was front and
center during the pujo committee
hearings and he became the face of Wall
Street power despite his financial
success Jon's mental state was
deteriorating he had multiple nervous
breakdowns and he struggled to deal with
the Public's negative portrayal of him
in the media ironically he was actually
due to board the Titanic for its maiden
voyage but due to health issues pulled
out at the last moment meanwhile the
pujo committee paved the way for the
establishment of the Federal Reserve
since it was clear they couldn't just
rely on a handful of ultra rich and
Powerful individuals to step in and fix
the economy but Jon would never see the
repercussions of this investigation
because month later on March 31st 1913
the 75 year old financier died while on
vacation in Rome after his death Jon's
son took over the business and continued
its expansion in fact even in present
day there are still concerns the bank is
too powerful it's undergone countless
Acquisitions and merges over the year
something John himself would have been
proud of like merges with bank one best
earns and most notably of all in the
year 2000 the murder with Chase Bank to
create JP Morgan Chase with an estimated
three trillion dollars in assets after
200 years of consolidation in the
banking industry JPMorgan Chase is the
biggest bank in the world by market
capitalization and so whilst opinion
will be divided on John Pierpont Morgan
there's no doubt his legacy lives on but
personally when it comes to the era of
these industrialists my favorite story
is Cornelius Vanderbilt honestly there
was nobody quite like him and so if you
don't know his story yet you've got to
check this video out right here to see
his brutal rise to the top I'll see you
there in a second cheers

a really unique place I've been to go
riding is up in San Francisco I recently
visited up there to experience what the
city was on a bike and the uniqueness of
it comes with the traffic the people the
constantly having your eyes open if the
hills are your best friends and your
word friend at the same time I feel like
San Francisco challenged my like
physical obviously because of the hills
but like my like cognitive ability to
decide where I want to go because with
the fixed gear your options of ways out
are pretty limited
I mean you granted you if you ride a
brake like you have that that last-ditch
effort to get out of the situation but
in San Francisco for me it was more
challenging and I like that but I had to
think while I was riding we're here you
could ride just four miles and not have
to pay attention and just have your
headphones in and just just go
[Music]
inspiration for writing
for me stems from day to day what's
going on in my head and things are
happening around me I feel like want to
get out enjoy the day alright I feel
like you had too much on my mind alright
but feel like I'm having a great day
might as well add to it I write a quote
that I really like is remember why you
started with neck goes with anything
remember white sort of riding remember
why he started working remember why he
started doing anything it's really
simple yet really deep at the same time
because you gotta remember why he
started people lose track of that I feel
this is a quote by Henry Thompson it's a
faster and faster until the thrill of
speed overcomes the fear of death you're
literally going so fast that you have to
enjoy that moment or else you're just
gonna be terrified if you don't enjoy
going really fast like down a hill
you're gonna be sitting there scared as
 but if you let that thrill overcome
you that I'm here it just kind of goes
away and when that fear goes away that's
that's the old man
and that's partially why I write it
right excuse
[Music]

something like seven million years ago
there was nothing like a human on earth
there was not even a pre human standing
upright
there were simply great apes very much
like the ones that live with us today
[Music]
I was crossing the river at dawn it was
just getting light and I was jumping
from stone to stone to try not to get my
boots wet as I crossed this broad stream
and in the middle I pause then I looked
down the stream just to kind of you know
woke up and down the stream just to
check out the view and when I looked
downstream just about 20 meters away
from me maybe 30 meters away from me at
the most there was a big male or onit on
and he hadn't seen me because he was
doing the same thing as me he was going
the other direction trying to cross the
river without getting his feet wet I
just was so struck by the fact that what
he was doing was so similar to what I
was just doing and I just felt like you
know to a sort of passing the morning
dawn there
[Music]
we usually have to get up really early
so maybe 3:30 in the morning wake up and
then get ready and we really need to be
at the run upon Ness by 5:00 a.m. when
they wake up so that means you ready and
then hiking could be up to an hour and
the rain forest in the dark using our
headlamp to the nest one of the things
that makes a heart is actually finding
them they're primarily solitary and so
it actually takes a long time to find
them they can they can go outside of our
of our study area it may take us like a
week of search days of their person days
to actually find their aunt on
it's not realistic to just what hunter
force myself and go find a neurotic on
the photograph it's not gonna happen so
I'm always teaming up with a research
team that are already trusting followed

in the whole world
ironic on only lived in one area
two big islands of Sumatra and Borneo in
Southeast Asia and within those islands
of course they only lives in the
remaining good areas of rainforest one
of those is a national park called zoom
polymers where I've been working for for
twenty years with my wife Sheryl and
that's where she has a long-term runtime
project our site is deep in the interior
of that National Park and it comprises
the eight different habitats

huge area over a hundred thousand
hectares in size and challenge County
Research Station which is where we've
carried out most of the proton research
academic pound is only two thousand
hectares and these are on atoms the
wrong times we study at chellah Ponte
they don't necessarily stay within those
two thousand hectares all the time so my
goal was to stay with these wrong tones
for five days sometimes up to ten days
in a row over the course of an entire
year by staying with them for these long
periods I was also able to document
really unique behaviors that haven't
been captured before
so before I studied biology and
anthropology in college I really had no
idea that other species had culture
besides humans and so when I saw these
cultural traditions in Iran for the
first time it was sort of a really big
sight to behold it was my first day and
I was out early in the morning to go to
Cho that's nest and when I got there I
had never seen her on the town in the
wild not even in the zoo and I was under
his tree waiting for him to wake up
sometime around 5:30 in the morning
first thing he did was he let out this
really loud long call right above me
[Music]
it was a very powerful experience it was
not a sound that I for anything like it
to meet culture is such a human element
and to see in other species is really
fascinating culture means so much to
humans so almost everything we do is
cultural both with feeding traditions
and with social traditions you see
things that are inherited from mother to
child for sometimes adopted from friend
to friend that show that behavior has
got this wonderful flexibility
adaptability that is so much of a
characteristic of humans and seen in the
great apes
[Music]
so around towns do this vocalization
called kiss squeaking it's done by
cursing their lips and making a kissing
sound like like a roll much louder
vocalization this week is a not a threat
sound that they make when they actually
meet an unfamiliar onit on they also do
it to people sometimes including pollen
they do this using leaves they grab some
liens they bring it up to their mouth
they do this kiss squeak and then they
throw the leaves out at other field
sites they may not use the leaves at all
this is an example of a local custom
that's found in that area similar to the
way people greet each other differently
in different countries maybe in some
place you know people shake hands
another place they bow so wrong times
are also showing these interesting
cultural variations between sites
[Music]
I've always been fascinated understand
you know why we're human what makes us
human
you know we had so many kinds of humans
in the past and different kinds of
bipedal Apes you know Oscar put the
scenes and we had some that went extinct
and some that didn't and then involved
into human so you know why is that you
know why did some population of also put
the scenes eventually evolved into the
Homo genus I think that the human
species is incredibly fortunate to have
in orangutans and the other great apes
gorillas and bonobos and chimpanzees
representatives of what we came from we
still share of varying a large
percentage of our DNA with maybe around
97% orangutans survived one window into
understanding human evolution
[Music]
there's different ways that bronze ons
make umbrellas one way is they just
break off an entire branch and sort of
modify this branch to make an umbrella
other times they pull the entire branch
towards then make a little roof over the
head
some were on a tongue when they're
making a nest and it's still raining
really hard they would actually make a
big roof over their nests they can put
together a bunch of branches and leaves
and sort of weave hovering and that's a
really effective way for them to stay
dry while they're sleeping
to all the great apes make this and
they're the only primate that makes nest
that's important because they have large
bodies and it's a way that they can
sleep in the trees where they're safer
from ground predators there seems to be
variation and kind of some subtleties of
nest building we heard some researchers
from another site describing that they
made a pillow to go in the nest and we
thought oh you know we've never seen
that right but we'd never have thought
about it like we just thought of making
a nest building a platform and lying
down and we never watched that closely
well once we heard these researchers and
other sites say that if they saw around
convicting a pillow we started watching
more carefully and then and then sure
enough like we noticed that there are
cons that good and pollen we're also
sometimes making a pillow it's putting
it down just as they plop down on top of
it and so as researchers you know learn
more and more about our own towns and
know what flushes to ask know what to
look for you know we're learning more
interesting things
it is so precious to be able to
understand our connection to the natural
world to have these other species to
give us lessons and remind us where we
come from
it makes us in some ways humble it also
makes us fascinated and yet we risk
losing them all newton guitar and render

Ron can't live anymore because it's
turning to alcohol plantation or burn
down is not good for our caste and
that's the main reason that number of
Ron towns have been declining
drastically over the last few decades
it's because of the huge amount of
forest in Borneo and Sumatra that have
been lost
in 2016 orangutan became critically
endangered they are in a very top level
of threatened category their numbers are
decreasing at a more rapid rate than we
had initially thought and they are in
need of immediate conservation action
it's gonna be a race against time to be
able to document what are the cultural
variation before they just disappear
forever
every lock on life is really important
they only have an average of the baby
about once every seven or eight years
the longest of birth spacing of any
mammal so with their slow rate of
reproduction a lot of dogs simply can't
sustain any kind of reduction in their
population like that over the long term
this century we could lose all of the
orangutans if it carries on the rate of
devastation in Borneo and Sumatra that's
been seen in the recent decades we stand
so much to gain and we stand so much to
lose
yes
you can't protect what you don't know we
can't all go to Borneo or Smosh or we
can't all go to the rainforest there but

breakups are never easy especially when
your ex goes on to become a wealthy
petrol state but this is what happened
to sweden which was in a union with
norway for almost a century until
they're split in 1905. but what caused
this dissolution why did sweden and
norway break up so as of the closing
years of the napoleonic wars norway was
a part of the kingdom of denmark whose
ruler frederick vi had just sided with
napoleon now a lot of countries in
europe had done the same previously like
russia who would use swedish closeness
with britain as justification to invade
it and grab finland for its own soon
after this russia decided that it didn't
like napoleon anymore and so it was time
for new allies the swedish king wasn't
doing much because of a heart attack but
his government did sense an opportunity
finland wasn't coming back but by siding
with the coalition against napoleon and
his danish ally sweden could gain norway
something which britain russia and
prussia agreed to and even the danish
king agreed to its loss providing he got
to keep greenland and iceland the people
of norway were not happy with suddenly
being the subject of the swedish king
and so the prince of denmark called
christian because of course he was
declared himself the king of norway in
1814 and proclaimed its independence
against the allies he stood no chance of
succeeding but whilst they were busy
fighting napoleon there was an
opportunity to win political support and
he turned to britain whom he felt would
recognize the plight of the norwegian
people and do the right thing to stop
them from being handed over to a foreign
king but fun fact no tensions rose and
when the swedish came to claim their
prize fighting broke out this lasted for
about two weeks and ended with the
swedish making some concessions in
return for norway joining the union
voluntarily norway would keep its
semi-democratic constitution the king's
powers there would be limited and norway
would maintain separate armed forces
relations between the two states
improved over the next half a century
with the swedish-based kings presenting
a much more conciliatory tone to the
norwegian subjects although by doing
this they angered swedish politicians
who saw norway as the junior partner in
the union and many therefore that norway
would never be placated and would simply
keep asking for more and they weren't
wrong norwegian politicians kept asking
for more autonomy over the course of the
late 19th century the big one was when
in 1891 norwegian elections saw the
liberal party victorious the liberals
were proponents of norwegian
independence but if that couldn't be
achieved then they demanded separate
foreign and trade policy for norway this
was a big no-no since at that point the
union would essentially be dead the
norwegian government made a formal
request for these new powers and the
swedish responded with a well-formulated
logical argument no and if you keep
asking we're going to invade the
liberals backed down and over the next
decade instead opted to focus on norway
they removed any reference to the union
from their flag massively increased the
size of the armed forces and built up
border defenses in case of an invasion
and in retaliation the swedish ended
free trade between the two and imposed
tariffs on products from britain
norway's largest trade partner it was
1905 that marked the death of the union
though when the norwegian government
passed a law establishing itself as
separate diplomatic service the king
vetoed this the government resigned the
king refused to accept their resignation
or appoint a new government and as such
the norwegians argued that he was in
violation of the constitution by leaving
norway without leadership and in
response the norwegian parliament
declared its independence in response
sweden mobilized which led norway to do
the same and both army sat on the border
facing off swedish politicians and
commanders were ready for war and it was
only when the swedish people were
overwhelmingly against military action
that they backed down this support was
largely due to the norwegian referendum
in which 99.9 of voters backed
independence which made it clear to
everyone that sweden could no longer
force norway to stay as such the swedish
people threatened mutiny in the army and
the general strike if norway was invaded
which meant that king oscar ii had no
choice but to acknowledge the end of the
union the norwegian people then voted
for a prince of denmark to become king
of norway and thus after a mere 500
years of being controlled by a foreign
power norway would once again be an
independent state i hope you enjoyed

a standoff between a man who was wanted
by the FBI and a large number of federal
agents surrounding a cabin where a
fugitive named Randy Weaver is holed up
with his family in 1992 a bloody
standoff between lawmen and an armed
white separatist named Randy Weaver left
his wife 14-year-old son and a federal
agent Dead The 11-day Siege at a place
called Ruby Ridge Idaho it happened
before Waco and for many it's an even
bigger rallying cry I want the truth
you've got the OK Corral you've got
certain moments in the history of
American law enforcement where society
says wait a minute we got to take a look
at this in a different way Ruby Ridge
began a paradigm shift inadequate
performance Ruby Ridge shook the highest
ranks of the FBI and it remains a
watchword wherever law enforcement
stands off against barricaded suspects
today this story is used as what not to
do that gives me hope maybe we won't
make the same mistakes maybe we won't
rush into things when it's a matter of
life or
[Music]
death I thought they were chasing down a
moose or a bear or something honestly I
had no clue that there were people with
guns in the woods that day 16-year-old
Sarah Weaver was in her family's remote
Idaho cabin when their dog ran into the
woods barking her father Randy Weaver a
family friend and her 14-year-old
Brother Sam followed with their rifles
the next thing she heard was an
explosion of gunfire everything in me
wanted to run down the hill and try and
you know protect my brother cuz I knew
he was down there and I'd always been
his big sister I'd always been his
protector so there was a part of me that
just wanted to take off down the
driveway and make sure he was okay torn
she stayed with her mother and younger
sisters until the friend Kevin Harris
returned he said that Sam was gone
and I think my whole world fell apart at
that
moment none of us at that time were
thinking that anything worse could
happen but unb own to Sarah US Marshals
had been staking out her parents who
were vehemently anti-government for
months her father had fled charges of
selling two illegal shotguns and her
mother had indicated they wouldn't
surrender without a fight when the dog
uncovered the Marshall's location an
agent shot it and a gunfight ensued that
killed 14-year-old Sam Weaver and a
deputy US Marshall named William Degan I
can't speak for everybody on my team but
I assumed I was walking into into a
violent situation there was likely to be
a Shootout scores of federal agents
quickly descended the next morning as
Sharpshooters like Chris wicam took
position around the cabin they were
under an unusual order if any adult male
is observed with a weapon deadly force
can and should be employed the entire
world for someone in my position at that
time is this big around you don't see
the larger circumstances you don't see
the larger picture you just see the
world world through a
scope dad was wanting to go see Sam one
more time and just I guess do some more
grieving say goodbye I don't know and so
I took off after him and he made it
around the shed ahead of me the people
that I saw with assault rifles were
moving from tree to building to wood
pile through fog uh I didn't have the
shot my finger was on a trigger I was
trying to take the shot I didn't have it
I just heard a giant boom I I said dad
what happened and he said you know I've
been shot and you know at this point my
mom had stepped out of the door and she
was screaming what happened what
happened and get in the house get in the
house and we all get piled up in front
of the door
and I hear what goes I hear what is like
a gunshot going off in my ear
and a mom just drops to my
side I knew I knew what had happened to
her immediately
I thought it was the end for all of us
at that
point Sarah's mother Vicki took a fatal
shot to the head as she held the
family's 10-month-old baby in her arms
but outside the cabin no one was aware
Vicki was dead and agents kept trying to
negotiate with her when they got on the
bullhorn and started asking
for Mom to come out
and have pancakes for breakfast with her
kids
wouldn't you want to do that with your
children sort of
thing it added it's a cliche to say it
added insult to injury but it did as
news of the standoff spread journalists
converged on the scene two people have
already died neither side seems ready to
back down the FBI says they will not
leave until Weaver and his friend Kevin
Harris who lives with him are in custody
everyone here in Naples agrees that
Weaver is a white supremacist who just
wants to be left alone for police he is
a fugitive on a federal arms charge
heavily armed and dangerous and a small
army of right-wing sympathizers also
gathered on the road below the cabin to
protest Baby K baby killer you're a
traitor to your rank in your
country the Weavers held out for a total
of 11 days after Vicki was shot they
believed they'd be killed if they
stepped outside the standoff ended only
after Bo gites a right-wing presidential
candidate sympathetic to the Weaver's
cause negotiated a surrender our camera
caught a glimpse of the family walking
into the staging area the girl one of
the girls is wearing a red jacket at the
bottom of your screen when I got to the
meadow it was a scene out of a movie it
was inconceivable to me to think that
they would need so much and so many
people and and tanks and
helicopters all this for one family the
story was dramatized in a TV movie and
folk songs and it found a ready-made
audience the Ruby Ridge standoff became
a kind of founding myth of the radical
right it not only made the government
look bad it was bad people whatever
views they have whatever illegal
activities they have should not be shot
down
by government snipers when they are not
actively threatening the life of
somebody later investigations revealed
that law enforcement had made a series
of Errors authorities on the ground
communicated poorly with agents arriving
from afar which exaggerated the threat
Weaver posed and agents on the scene
failed to negotiate or set up a clear
line of communication with the family
until it was too late in the end jurors
decided Randy Weaver's most serious
crime was failing to appear in court and
then came accusations that the FBI had
attempted to cover up its mistakes the
FBI is feeling the heat during Weaver's
1993 trial another FBI standoff ended in
tragedy and accusations of misconduct 76
members of the branch deidan religious
sect died in a federal raid on their
compound in Waco Texas there are Eerie
parallels with Waco in both cases
government miscalculation in the arrest
of a fanatic ended in gunfire and death
the radical right uh views itself as
being in a a battle to the death with
the federal government Ruby Ridge for
them was the opening shot of that war
critics complained there was no real
investigation and no real punishment
after the 1992 incident it's now clear
their voices have been heard amid
intense Federal scrutiny of the Ruby
Ridge Scandal the FBI's number two man
was demoted three other agents were
suspended and one was sent to jail and
the Weaver family won a $3.1 million
settlement from the federal government
law enforcement typically changes not
because someone has a brilliant idea we
change because we're sued or there's
public opinion that speaks against us
and we realized we had to change we had
to do this better since the early 1990s
the FBI says it's overhauled how it
responds to armed standoffs and train
hundreds of police departments across
the country the Federal deadly force
policy can't be modified on the fly as
it was at Ruby Ridge basically for us a
bone yeah you got to help me help you
yeah and agent's now trained to set up
better communication on the scene
organizationally we've changed right so
the negotiators are fully embedded
within our tactical section all right so
shield shield cover if you can slow
things down and negotiate and peacefully
communicate with the subjects and try to
figure out what's motivating them then
you should take full advantage can you
hear me in the bus this is Katie with
the FBI I want to talk to you about how
we're going to get the phone to you you
get involved in a shootout situation in
America today it's going to be litigated
for years we look at things differently
now we look and
say time is not the issue it once
was take the case of John Joe gray in
East Texas 7 years after Ruby Ridge
greay was stopped for a traffic
violation and got into a fight with a
state trooper and bit him he then then
retreated to his farm with his weapons
and refused to come out John Joe gray
how you doing a 51-year-old
self-proclaimed Freedom Fighter what
will happen if they try to raid this
place you come out after us bring x-3
body bags but local law enforcement made
a unique decision they decided not to
raid his compound to bring him to court
you look at things like wo you look at
things like Ruby bridge and I'm not sure
that it is worth going out there and Tak
change Henderson County Sheriff Ray nut
is the fourth Sheriff Who's decided not
to storm Gray's compound since the
standoff began and that's given this
case a special status often it's called
the longest running standoff in American
history he's been under self-imposed
house arrest for 14
years the longest term in prison I could
have given him was 10 I probably
wouldn't have given him 10 that doesn't
satisfy Gray's former son-in-law who
watched his ex-wife take their two
children into the compound and then
disappear gray refused to talk on camera
but claimed he'll stay put indefinitely
living off the land and occasional help
from a few supporters if the police do
come he told us I ain't going down
without a fight so far the battle has
remained oddly
one-sided this is more of I don't know a
lounge off because everybody's just kind
of chilled into what it is this isn't
going to end until John Joe gray passes
on it's not a perfect outcome to have
somebody thumbing their nose at a lawful
court order but in the respect that
nobody was killed it's an acceptable
outcome for me in the two decades since
Ruby Ridge Sarah Weaver bought a small
acreage in Montana with a portion of the
settlement money distanced herself from
her father's beliefs and made peace with
the past it's not easy being a Christian
forgiveness is an
ongoing choice and an ongoing
process I'm
forgiving the people that showed up with
tanks and guns and armored personnel
carriers and I'm forgiving the ones that
pulled the trigger I'm forgiving the
ones that sent the
orders forgiveness is not saying what
happened is okay because I believe if we
forget those
mistakes they they can be

a

mega machines channel represents marble
quarries in greece
this quarry has 25 levels
each level has eight meter height and
the total height of the quarry is 200
meters the first stage consists of
drilling
there are mining methods for cutting the
marble blocks with vegan drawer
wire cutting saw or chainsaw
[Music]
next is the detachment phase of the
marble blocks
[Music]
this process is performed using an
excavator with a custom ripper
each block has eight meters height six
meters width and weighs 280 tons
[Music]
extraction methods and the resulting
marble block sizes will depend on the
quarry in question
marble quarrying is usually done in
vertical cuts
however there are also cases where it is
also done in horizontal cuts
this shall depend on the area's
morphology
[Music]
wheel loaders are carrying the marble
blocks to the level arches where there
is more space to load the dumpers
carrying is done in the narrow streets
of every level
this can be really tough and requires
special handling by skillful operators
dumpers are loaded with special care and
sometimes need two-wheel loaders
depending on the size and weight of the
marble
dump trucks are moving the marble blocks
from the upper levels
to the bottom square of the quarry
[Music]
the square is the selection center where
the marble blocks are temporarily stored
there the marbles are washed after the
process of their extraction
before the marble blocks being
transferred measurements must be made by
specialists to give the correct shape
with the appropriate cutting
[Music]
method due to their large dimensions and
heavy weight the blocks need to be moved
and handled with specific machines both
during loading unloading and during
processing
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
the blocks are cut to dimensions that
will be suitable for subsequent
processing
cutting the marbles into blocks
the selection of marbles is based on
their quality shape and color
after the sorting and counting
the marble blocks are loaded on special
trucks to be transported to the
processing factory
so
blocks are generally stored outdoors in
the block yard until the next phase the
marble processing phase
they are introduced in the machine by
means of a platform that simplifies
their movement
they comprise diamond wires that can cut
the block in a vertical direction
in this manner they are able to obtain
as many slabs as the number of wires
they are equipped with
polishing method in this case we enhance
the marbles shine and color by leaving a
smooth glossy surface
[Music]
this would be the very last stage in the
marble preparation process in the case
of slabs that are ready for sale
otherwise the slabs would be subject to
further cutting and finishing procedures
[Music]
the marbles are ready for sale

the sinking of the ms estonia
swallowed by the cold and merciless
baltic sea
enclosed by central and northern
european countries is one of the most
extraordinary and beautiful seas
however
its beauty tends to be treacherous as
the harsh climate in the baltic sea
makes it pretty inhospitable
for centuries the baltic sea has been
infamous among seafarers with a number
of shipwrecks lying on the bottom of the
sea to prove it
in 1994
the stormy waters of the baltic took
away the lives of hundreds of victims

the disaster that shook the continent
and the entire world happened on
september 28 1994
the ship involved was ms estonia
a huge german-built cruise ferry owned
by the swedish estonian s-line marine
shipping company
on that day the ferry carried 989 people
of which 803 were passengers traveling
from tallinn estonia to stockholder
sweden
the ferry departed from talon the day
before on september 27th at 1915.
weather stations forecasted rough
weather on the open sea
nothing unusual for this part of the
year though
despite the slight list to starboard the
captain and his crew had things under
control despite the fact they were
sailing through waves of up to 20 feet
high
six hours after ms estonia left the port
at o121
its radio operator began sending mayday
signals half an hour later the ship
disappeared from radar screens
ms estonia was anything but a small ship
and seemed capable of withstanding the
bad weather at sea
it was built in 1980 in the meyer
wharfed shipyard in pampenburg west
germany
the ship was an 11 deck vessel
515.16 feet in length and with a tonnage
of 15 598 gross tons
it was indeed a huge vessel designed to
accommodate 2000 passengers and 460 cars
ms estonia was a roro type of vessel
short for roll-on roll-off
meaning that the vehicles are driven on
and off the ship on their own wheels via
built-in ramp
before the sinking ms estonia sailed for
14 years under flags of four different
operators
then in january 1993
it was purchased by the s line and
became the largest estonian vessel and a
symbol of the country's recently
regained independence
for more than a year and a half
ms estonia sailed from talon to
stockholm
it was quite a busy line because estonia
was a popular destination for swedish
tourists
on september 27 1994 the ship was
boarded by 803 passengers around half
the ferry's capacity
there were also 186 crew members
taking the number of people on board to
989.
when ms estonia left the port at talon
the weather was nice and calm
however once it sailed away from coastal
waters weather conditions began to
change
what ms estonia encountered could be
called rough weather by all means
the wind speed was between 15 and 20
meters per second
on the beaufort windforce scale such
conditions are categorized as moderate
gale but at the same time call for a
warning gale pennant
the waves reached a height of up to 20
feet
just five feet short of the highest
measured wave height on the baltic sea
however it seemed
the weather conditions were still within
the usual bad autumn weather on the
baltic
once ms estonia entered the stormy
waters the passengers began to feel the
disturbances due to the increased
rolling and pitching of the ship
strong wind blowing from the port was
also causing problems as the ship began
to list slightly to starboard
unfortunately it was not only because of
the wind that the ship started to lean
to one side
before departing it was fully loaded
with vehicles and cargo but in such a
way that the weight of the cargo was not
arranged evenly
the ship was leaning to port from the
very first moment of the trip
the strong wind just made it worse
even though an image of a ship leaning
to one side might sound terrifying it
was a common thing in seamanship
it was certainly not the factor that
caused the disaster
but once things began to go bad the
uneven disposition of the cargo did its
part in sinking the ship
despite the bad weather and heavy waves
hitting the port bow
ms estonia was sailing confidently on
its course with the speed of 14 knots
the trip to stockholm lasted 14 hours
and the captain was determined not to be
late even though he departed a couple of
minutes behind schedule
around zero 100 hours a giant wave hit
was followed by a loud metallic bang
coming from the bow
sailors on the storage deck reported it
to the second officer on the watch
who ordered the inspection of the
loading ramp and the visor
ms estonia had a special feature
installed on the bow called the visor
the visor allows the bow to articulate
up and down
similar to visors on motorcycle helmets
allowing access to the loading ramp and
cargo deck
the inspection of the indicator lamps in
the storage deck showed nothing wrong
with neither the visor nor the loading
ramp so the second officer continued the
journey keeping the course at the same
speed
however the loud bang was just the
beginning as the passengers and crew
members reported more unusual sounds in
the following 10 minutes
at 0-115
the second officer ordered a new
inspection
this time there was no need for sailors
to check the indicator lamps as instead
of the visor
there was a massive opening on the bow
the visor detached from hinges
letting the ramp fall open
practically without the bow the water
was rapidly entering the storage deck of
the ship
with tons of sea water in the cargo deck
the ship started to list heavy to
starboard
an alarm was raised immediately and all
four engines were shut down to reduce
the ship's speed
however there was practically nothing
the crew could do
the listing was unstoppable
in just 15 minutes the ship had rolled
60 degrees and the water was breaching
into upper decks
the passengers were completely confused
about what was going on
the water was rapidly coming from all
holes and the chaos erupted
many passengers withdrew earlier to
their cabins because of the seasickness
they got during the trip
a lot of them failed even to leave their
cabins before the water reached them
those who were alerted by the water and
rolling of the ship started to run and
tried to reach the upper decks
the water was coming in so quickly
though that it closed almost all
accesses to upper decks
at one point due to the breach of the
water
the entire ship lost the electricity
people were trapped in the dark
[Laughter]
those who reached the upper decks began
pushing life rafts and jumping into the
cold water of the baltic sea
the water temperature of 10 degrees
celsius the rain and the turbulent sea
was of no help to those who escaped the
sinking ship
a lot of life rafts were capsized or
swallowed by waves
people were floating in the freezing sea
some of them wearing only light clothes
once everything was over it became
apparent that most of the survivors were
physically strong people
it took a lot of strength to overcome
giant waves in the cold and merciless
baltic sea
at o121
ms estonia sent the first mayday signal
the signal was recorded by the marine
rescue coordinating center at the
finnish city of turku but was very weak
and unclear
at 0-123
ms estonia sent a direct message to
another fairy ms silja europa calling
for help
the third officer behind the radio on ms
estonia reported a bad list and a
blackout and asked for ms silja europa
and other fairies to come to their
assistance
unfortunately
due to the blackout he was unable to
report the exact position of his ship
still the captain of ms silja europa
directed his ship toward ms estonia's
route
he forwarded the call for help to the
nearest ferry ms mariella
and other ferries in the vicinity and
rescue stations in sweden and finland
the third officer from ms estonia
managed to send his coordinates five
minutes after the first message
59 degrees
22 minutes latitude and 21 degrees 40
minutes longitude east
that was the last message heard from ms
estonia
at that moment
the list was more than 90 degrees with
the starboard side completely submerged
at 0-150
ms estonia disappeared from radar
screens
the ferry sank with the stern going down
first
ms mariella was the first fairy to
arrive at the scene at 0-212 and find
only life rafts scattered all over the
place
by that time
ms estonia was already at the bottom of
the sea
soon
four other ferries arrived including ms
soldier europa whose captain was
assigned to coordinate the rescue
operations
fairies launched life rafts into the
water and used rescue slides to save
people from the cold sea
the first helicopters arrived at 0.305
playing a significant role in saving the
survivors
finnish helicopters transferred them to
land stations while the swedes opted for
a quicker but riskier solution
they used cords to attach the life rafts
and transfer them to ferries on the side
in the end
the decision proved to be on the spot as
a single swedish helicopter saved more
people than all fairies
combined despite the brave effort of
rescuers the final casualty toll was
devastating
on board ms estonia there were 989
people
of which around 310 reached outer decks
half of these succeeded in boarding life
rafts
in the end
rescuers saved only 138 people
the rest died either from drowning or
from hypothermia
around 650 people didn't manage to leave
the ship and sank along with it
it took less than an hour from the first
loud sound until ms estonia sank
the ship wreckage was later found lying
on the seabed at a depth of 300 meters
its visor was found a quarter of a mile
away
immediately after the disaster joint
accident investigation commission from
estonia finland and sweden was formed
the investigation that lasted for two
and a half years labeled the visor
failure as the reason why ms estonia
sank
as stated in the report the first loud
metallic noise was connected to the
failure of the visor locking mechanism
later sounds were probably a result of
the failure of the rest of the locking
mechanisms
once they all failed
the visor simply detached and left a
massive opening on the bow
allowing the water to come into the
cargo deck
because of the size of the gap on the
bow the water flooded the deck in just a
couple of minutes and incited listing to
starboard
the visor was recovered from the seabed
and subjected to thorough testing to
determine if it had any design flaws
it was determined that under the
condition of the low waves
the strength of the visor along with its
locking mechanism and hinges was
completely adequate
however
the strong waves on september 28 1994
hitting the underside of the visor have
put too much pressure on the locking
devices the deck hinges and the lifting
cylinder mountings
due to the repeating pounding action of
the waves the system simply collapsed
and the visor broke off
similar incidents happen on other
vessels built in the same german
shipyard
a few years before the disaster
ms diana 2 had precisely the same
problem that allowed the water to
ingress into the ship
however
the ferry crew saved the ship by
reducing the vessel's speed and
returning the ferry to the port
as soon as the final report was
published in 1997
a series of controversies erupted
the first came from the german
manufacturer
who claimed that the visor failure was
not the starting point of the sinking
instead
they claimed the ferry was hold on the
starboard side after which the water
entered the cargo deck
the visor detached only after the deck
was flooded
indeed a 2020 underwater footage of the
shipwreck recorded a 13-foot hole in the
ship's hull
the rupture was instantly put in
connection with some earlier
controversies regarding the transport of
military equipment
the estonian head of the commission
formed to consider new findings
even claimed the ship had collided with
the submarine
however the latest report labeled the
size of the rupture too small to sink
the ship in less than an hour
the german designer made one more
accusation against the ship owner on
account of improper maintenance of the
visor and ramp mechanisms
for which they provided photographic
evidence
finally it was revealed that the ferry
was not even designed to be used outside
coastal waters
today
17 years past the sinking of ms estonia
controversy still shed light on one of
the greatest fairy disasters since the
sinking of the titanic i hope you found

Spurgeon root has a mission the pastor
and outreach worker has devoted his life
to helping street gang members get out
drug dealers violent offenders if they
really want to change their lives
Spurgeon root is there to help the city
of Regina and the Canadian province of
Saskatchewan is infamous for its
Aboriginal based gangs for Spurgeon root
this is the heritage of his country's
colonial past
[Music]
northcentral Regina's most crime-ridden
neighborhood and Spurgeon roots home for
the last 20 years he knows most of the
gangs by name the native syndicate
Westside soldiers Indian mafia Crips but
the culture around gangs keeps changing
he says neither syndicate tag does the
Saskatchewan Warriors tag and one that I
don't recognize the white one is a
native syndicate tag and then there's an
X through it which is you know like an
act of aggression or a screw you I don't
like you kind of a thing so this is part
of the challenge that we have right now
is that we've got these young younger
guys starting gangs and you don't
necessarily know who it is or you see a
tag and you recognize that it's a gang
tag because it's got numbers and it's
got all the you know looks like a gang
tag but you're not necessarily sure who
it is or what they're doing or who
they're aligned with spurgeon root says
he was on the ground when it all started
working with Aboriginal youth in North
Central I knew a bunch of the guys that
were getting involved and some of them
had known for a long time and I
considered them more like friends in a
lot of ways when your friends are
getting involved in things that are
really unhealthy and that are hurting
them and are killing people you kind of
want to help I guess one of the gang
members Spurgeon root helped was Lester
they meet in a wood shop the pastor
started 10 years ago to provide
marginalized youth with an opportunity
to develop new skills Lester just got
out of jail
Lester's father was murdered when he was
still little he says he spent his
childhood with his grandparents on one
of the reserves close to Aegina as a kid
Lester started to drink and to smoke
weed later using crystal meth in 2005 he
joins the Native syndicate one of the
most notorious gangs in Regina and most
of my time and there was just what I had
to do I was kind of an enforcer just
what I you start from a striker to a
soldier to you know make it you you work
your way up there and from my experience
in there I had to knock around guys beat
him up short moments balls I had I had
it right away and what I didn't like
though like I've seen a lot of beatings
I seen seen people get killed and stuff
and I didn't like what is going on is
that's the reason why I got out of the
game most of those here share a similar
story a dream of having a family and
being accepted which turned into a
nightmare of crime violence and drug
addiction most of the gang members of
Regina which is like Ron are First
Nations they say they were living a
transgenerational trauma
in the foster system mom a little bit of
foster sister but I I grew up in a young
age or my mother didn't care about me
and her husband didn't care about me and
my real dad was too messed up and biker
stuff himself right he died when I was
like eleven years old
right so I I got spoiled city streets
right it's all I knew like some of my
family was drug addicts and stuff
unfortunately I've seen the money so I
became addicted to money right time I
was 17 years old I was making like
$5,000 a days on drugs the gang tattoo
still remind them of what they have done
and what they have been through Kody
another former gangster that Spurgeon
root helped says he joins the Native
syndicate when he was 13 money money
friends acceptance I was given all that
up and Aikido starting fresh because I
wonder when I did give it up I went to a
really bad week our identity crisis I
didn't know what it was
the big bad gangster no more if I was
she to go do this and it took me a while
mess me up my name is like yeah it was
because of their children that Cody and
Ron decided to leave the gang lifestyle
they say to be better dads than the one
staying here Regina has the seventh
highest population of Aboriginal people
in Canada and like many parts of the
country Spurgeon root says it has its
own story of discrimination and racism
against First Nations he takes us to a
cemetery not far away from a former
residential school in Regina such
schools were established to remove
indigenous children from the influence
of their own families and to assimilate
them into euro Canadian culture
part of where it started there's a hole
and the impact of colonialism and the
decision to try and wipe out an entire
cultural people group and there's spots
like this all over Saskatchewan right
like this is not an unusual spot sadly
so when you've got people that are
disposable for generations it's not
surprising that they you know need to
resort to other ways of living a late
visit to Lester who seems to be going
through a crisis my dad died and he was
20 he never went to residential but my
mom did and she heard for a lot of years
from [ __ ] that happened and I had to see
my mom you know I had to see my mom I
grew up around [ __ ] house parties and
[ __ ] when I was living with her and
well I'm a smart guy and stuff so I
learned to shake it off and I have two
sons now my own and I don't want to see
my kids go through what you know
fighting oh he's I still love it but I
don't do it I love it when I win you
know just get that rush and I don't like
to hurt people anymore I don't want to
go back to my old life of using drugs
and drinking drinking drinking drinking
drinking for days and days and days
Virgen root is there for him
listening encouraging buying if
necessary grocery vouchers for Lester's
kids
getting out is it's not easy but I mean
to an extent you can be out and then
you're out and if you don't go back and
you don't mess with the same people and
you're not involved in any of that then
you can be out but the challenge is that
people still have all the same
addictions they've got all the trauma
still back there as a former
high-ranking gang member
Ron is still facing consequences from
his past after his release from prison
he lives in a halfway house and he is
determined to help young people avoid
his fate
Kosmic sure you only cost me the I had a
cost my wife not now I'm I'm the First
Nations man that helps this community
not poison it by the sale of narcotics
ray I help I help the kids in that
community instead of you know selling
drugs to everybody right so it's way
better
that's all we're supposed to do in life
they're not supposed to do we're not
supposed to be gang members I'm not
supposed to shoot people these bad
people in celle drugs are supposed to
help your community right
community work on Saturday morning
friends and members of Spurgeon roots
congregation come together to clean up
for winter
[Music]
ginamarie is also here for John and she
are viable college sweethearts married
for 20 years together they decided to
raise three daughters in north-central
I'll never forget my daughter coming
home and grade two and asking me mum
what's abuse and having to explain that
and she's just but why would I why would
a grown up ever hurt a kid and and she
just that was so out of her
understanding and and and she was crying
over it because she knew that that was
some of her friends from school we're
dealing with that and that was hard it
sort of felt like I was stripping her
innocence away a little bit and so
sometimes after something like that whoa
is this really where we want to raise
our kids
but they stuck with their decision
believing that they are involved in
something that's beyond here and now and
that's it's up to everyone to choose
what to focus on it helps to keep in
mind that you know people are changing
good things are happening it's not all
bad by any stretch
[Music]
Lester Ron Cody and many others they are
the reason for Spurgeon root to keep
hope
[Music]

last let's talk about uh the BC
documentary on TB Joshua uh most of uh
Revelations are coming out after his
death that he was an ult te leader he
raped and did all sorts of things what's
your take
unfortunately it's a disgrace to um an
institution a media institution
establishment like BBC to come out with
such nonsense does not make any sense at
all they have not been close
to whatever ytic or means they have used
to carry out such a documentary is
unfortunate how many times have They
Carried documentary on the P that said
man should marry
man alone is a very simple thing they
should leave the man alone but is it
Joshua that collap his house that t
Joshua used want to collapse he start
building that
K the government took him to
court somebody who has added value to
humanity then after how
many years of his death so to say they
coming up with a documentary that is uh
this and that that and make confessions
bro let me tell you a lot of sabotage
can
happen people can blackmail
anybody Jesus Christ of Nazareth was
also
blackmailed I have on two occasions have
relationship with t josua i i not be
talking too much but when I see
something you understand I'm able to
understand one of two
things
initially the media thought that t
Joshua was antic man initially yes when
he came up with
[Applause]
synagog but people that know him from
the scratch knew
him until people begin to have access to
him people begin to unveil him people
begin to discover him this is a man that
spent
12 months in his mother's belly before
he was
born
Destiny he has a date with
Destiny he's a man that God has destined
for what he did no two way about it
saying he died at a a relatively young
age no matter what what the most
important thing is that what are the
legacies you left
behind it is not half far it is UN well
cation has transformed so many lives
more than the
BBC the BBC report that inducted
we what is the end of it now the same
BBC
report BBC report that carried a fake
report on be
France BBC report that Carri a fake
report BBC I sure it is BBC Nigeria not
BBC London no that is just the truth I
am sure that this BBC is BBC Nigeria not
BBC
London that is just the truth of course
it should be BBC ner because what do you
expect you know there was issue of
leadership pu when T Joshua died and a
certain cabal wanted want a to take over
power take over the Church
administration
those people can bread their
way to Blackmail anybody who tells you
that at least one or two occasions I
have found myself to
synagogue yes and I that publication the
BET of greatness go and check it on
magazine it was circulated
everywhere the bet that the title they
have Joshua on the cover the bir of
great I do a
aor right up
investigative report it was not in good
ter KH let me tell you you know
Christian body Niger know let me tell
you that is not the truth the truth
remains
this for instance
please
K LOVE World Christ
Embassy look at how he started his
father was a father a pastor in one
maybe Apostolic Church another but right
right from the time CHR was in
ABA from year one he preaches the gospel
throughout his years in that
University he has a he has a
call see
they asking him who anointed you that's
the problem who is your god spiritual
Godfather that's the
problem that is why they saw what he was
doing was
extraordinary because him too is
extraordinary if I tell you this a lot
of things I know about t Joshua when he
started that Ministry how he started
that Ministry in
you will not believe because I remember
that time I used to come from East I
used to do business at Broad Street
Legos
there I stay
at I have a house somewhere
at so most times my business partner is
at I used
to you
know cast I used to pass through that
Asis I used to notice this man on daily
basis fasting and praying with without
without no how no
block continuously he will tell you that
consistency brings
Freedom they don't need to listen to
what what people are saying we know the
name they call Jesus Christus person was
alive even some Pastors in Nigeria today
he to call their
names so I'm not surprised
Nigeria can do come up with such a thing
for someone who has contributed
immensely to the development to tourism
sector of Nigeria why that was and
not I've not seen
anyone
male or
female yes they will come out I said
that t rap
me going to
Joshua he's always in the
mountain he's always
playing so I want to say it is
unfortunate on the side but I'm not get
like BBC should come up with such a a a
a a a documentary a blackmail against a
a reputed man of God I respect T Joseph
very much I believe in his ministry I
believe in his calling I believe that
God has Ed him for
that
call and he ran it and did
well the question is is it coll is build
building coll coll
it we know what
happened this some of this is we you
know is
conspiring BR let me tell
you there is
no sector
institution
office that is
people
anybody to bring something
down I want to tell you this but even T
Joseph was still alive he has
enemies KH was number
one Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria
they were they were among to question
this josua that the government of
Nigeria we
celebrating having contributed so
much to
tourism what yes I met I met three South
Americans
pastors we are in the same L
inside tbj synagogue that day we
interacted for over 1 Hour 2
hours three Sou
American
pastors one of them was representing the
whole Southern America he was there for
two hours we were deliberating
on how T Joshua is going to attend a
crusade in South
America if T is not genuine God wouldn't
have taken him to that height he T lives
all over the world there's no continent
today there are certain issues between
nations and
Nations elections problem has attended
to so
many I'm not saying that there are no
challenges Jesus Christ also has his own
challenges but the bible say that they
can never buy any means consum us or
come near us and that is just the truth
Joshua is a true man of God I say I'm
saying
it you know why if you go to his church
it does not say in the name of devil be
healed he says in the name of Jesus
Christ be
healed and the bible say that those that
call upon their name of Jesus Christ
shall be saved thank you very much
accusation labeled against T Joshua none
has been legally
proven legally proven is that nobody has
taken T Joshua to court is all side
talks
accusations imaginations fictitious
stories that we have not been able to
confirm one fact out of them all
Confessions by some people see
confessions were being made in those
days when Joshua was alive they said
said this am said this one Ghana woman
said this I read online I watch online
are you listening to me say during the
church days Church week week days I see
TV Joshua doing his program
Nigerians within without members of the
World Europe Asia America other part of
the country Oceania anarctica trooping
to Synagogue Church of all Nations I
said to myself all these confessions
against TB Joshua why are these people
there they move on Convoy you see wh
white men coming and nobody has been
able to prove it that t Joshua was a bad
man in the court or with a lawyer see
let me tell you when a man is dead
everything about him is dead they are
just cooking all manner of stories
against this man I'm not saying that I'm
God I'm a God or God but let me tell you
why not go to court when he was allowed
alive Pro it that TV Joshua was a bad
man TV Joshua go to state interview his
kidsmen they the one that will tell you
whom T Joshua is when Joshua died they
went to his house TB Joshua's nephew or
Uncle he relived the story of the man
called TB Joshua he was a good man right
from school his school days TB Joshua
was a man that is generous he can give
he loves people he doesn't want people
to suffer I'm telling you the truth
so if he come up with any argument of T
josu to elephant or vulture or sleeping
with people's wives why didn't he take
him to court and prove it to the world
now that Joshua is dead now that the
giant is no longer there you are trying
to make you know
mess fall of his name because the man is
not alive let let me tell you if
actually that what they are saying is
right I think it's left for God to judge
him if actually what they saying is
wrong I think someone else somebody
somewhere else is going to Triple such
criticism or adance against TB Joshua on
them it's going toang to all of them I
don't think T TB Joshua is guilty of all
this
criticisms are listening to me all these
sins
offenses they are
or you know accusing him of I don't
think it is but it is only God that will
judge them if what they are saying
against this man Li is it BBC uh or the
people that confess
BBC is from UK England Britain they are
the worst people on the continent of
Africa now they are our enemies the
enemies of progress BBC are talking
about they are the English people and
Christians there's another name they
give them these people believes in
Witchcraft and they went against
witchcraft in 16 17 18 centuries onward
they kill anybody that is wish they kill
anybody that is Wizard that's how they
killed in America too listen and listen
good enemy of Christianity you are
talking about are the Britain so they
would like to rur England the Church of
England King Henry VII found
it
started Church of England during the
Reformation in 13 14 centuries it was a
controversy between him and the pope
when he wanted to marry Kine his senior
brother's wife see listen war broke out
between the Catholics and all the
followers of Pope that how arasmus John
Calvin Henry the broke out from the
Catholic Church who is Britain Britain
there not Christian Christians they are
anti-christian anti-s semantics they
hate the Jews they hate Jesus Christ so
whatever Britain is accusing to Joshua
of Britain they are more or less
pagans they sto most of the Antics actif
Antiquities from
Nigeria London what are you telling me
are they
believers they are not Dain que
Elizabeth
is a Christian what are you telling me
so it doesn't matter of whatever anybody
is accusing TB Joshua of I'm not trying
to exate him I'm a man I'm not God it's
God that is going to exate and judge but
I'm telling you that I dis associatees
or dist myself from any criticism or
blames or accusation
against TB Joshua of Synagogue Church of
all Nations that's my own take

foreign
[Music]
this weekend I watched one of the
biggest hits on Netflix right now which
is a documentary series from a
journalist named Graham Hancock the show
is called ancient apocalypse and in the
series just as he has throughout his
career Hancock argues that there was a
lost Global civilization that existed on
Earth some 12 000 years ago but it was
wiped out in a cataclysm
that erased most traces of this
civilization he claims that our
ancestors had a memory of this cataclysm
the the ancient Apocalypse in the title
which they recounted in the biblical
story of the flood and in other ancient
texts around the world
the way he puts it you know he says that
we are a a species with amnesia we don't
know the story of our own past and we
accept what we've been told by
mainstream science and Academia which
insists that there were was no you know
there were no civilizations at all in
fact certainly not Advanced ones prior
to about 4000 BC that's the mainstream
accepted version of events
um Hancock says that they're ignoring or
even potentially covering up evidence to
the contract
and what is the evidence well
much of it centers around various
ancient structures around the world that
have turned out to be much older than
they originally thought to be Hancock
points to for example
um one thousand-year-old pyramids that
as it turns out were built over top even
older pyramids which were built over
older ones like the kind of Russian
nesting doll sort of situation the
evidence indicates that that our
ancestors were in fact building bigger
and more complicated things earlier than
previously assumed
and so Hancock is is pointing to some of
this also there's the similarity between
these ancient structures like the
Egyptians weren't the only ones who
built pyramids obviously ancient people
all over the world made their own
versions of pyramids and they were
usually built to correspond with
astronomical phenomena
why did all these societies separated by
oceans and millennia
decide to build these structures and how
did they build them
that's an interesting question and one
that has never been sufficiently
answered Graham Hancock's answer is that
the survivors of a lost Ice Age
civilization went around the world
passing down the knowledge of how to
build these pyramids along with teaching
Agriculture and architecture and art Etc
um
and that's how they figured out how to
do it now why did these survivors do
this and how did they survive the
apocalypse that wiped out their
civilization and where were they
stationed for the centuries that would
have taken them to go around the whole
world teaching these techniques to
thousands of different societies and how
were they able to communicate with all
these people speaking different
languages and why isn't there any actual
material evidence of this Advanced
civilization that supposedly existed 12
000 years ago
Hancock says that it was wiped out in a
cataclysm but he also says that there
were enough survivors to support this
Global campaign to civilize the entire
world which means that there were a lot
of survivors
uh why didn't they leave behind any
direct evidence of their existence
these questions and many more are not
answered by Graham Hancock
which is why
I don't personally buy much of what he's
selling I am not persuaded
and yet
I very much enjoyed the series just as
I've enjoyed listening to him explain
his ideas during his several appearances
on Joe Rogan's podcast I've read one of
his books I found it interesting
um I think his theory is
are quite interesting and entertaining
and also outlandish and probably dead
wrong
despite what you've been told it is
possible to have this opinion about
someone or something it is possible to
believe that someone is wrong
and yet still find them fascinating
it is possible to disagree with
someone's ideas
and yet still believe that the ideas are
worth listening to
say whatever else you want about Graham
Hancock he is to use the cliche in
outside the box thinker and I can
personally always appreciate those types
of people we need more of those people
in the world not fewer they make life
more interesting they make conversations
more interesting
and they get people talking about
subjects that they would otherwise
ignore I mean a show about ancient
archeology is now the biggest hit on
Netflix
which I think as someone who enjoys
history that's that's worth celebrating
in its own right even if you reject his
hypothesis completely
this is not a difficult needle to thread
okay it's not hard to say
I disagree with your ideas
but I'm glad you've shared them
at least it shouldn't be hard
yet it's somehow beyond the capacity of
the mainstream media which has one word
for ideas that fall outside of the
mainstream well they have a few words
but one of the most uh the most common
words is it's the word is not
interesting but rather dangerous
and it's dangerous if it falls outside
of the mainstream hence many headlines
published over the past few days like
this one from the guardian says ancient
apocalypse is the most dangerous Show on
Netflix
and then the subheader of that article
says this
a show with a truly Preposterous theory
is one of the streaming Giants biggest
hits and it seems to exist solely for
conspiracy theorists why has this been
allowed
wait why has it been allowed
who is supposed to disallow it
well the writer never explains that he
also never really explains what exactly
makes a Preposterous quote-unquote
theory about ancient prehistory
dangerous
what is the danger precisely
so a bunch of people come to believe
that an advanced civilization existed
during the last ice age and and then
what what catastrophe is supposed to
follow from that
other articles have taken it a step
further claiming that the show is not
only dangerous but racist as well a
headline from a different publication
declares that there is a whole bunch of
quote white supremacist nonsense behind
Netflix's ancient apocalypse
yet Hancock never says anything about
race in the show or in his books as far
as I know
even if you think that his Lost
Civilization theory is the dumbest thing
you've ever heard in your life what in
the world makes it racist
well that's never explained either but
it doesn't have to be we already know
that this is the media's version of
Tourette's they just reflexively blurred
out the word racist when faced with
anything they don't like everything they
personally disapprove of is racist and
dangerous
as for the latter charge the best
attempt at an explanation comes from the
guardian article I mentioned which
arrives at this conclusion at the end it
says that's the danger of a show like
this it Whispers to the conspiracy
theorist in all of us and Hancock is
such a compelling host that he's bound
to create a few more in his wake
believing that Ultra intelligent
creatures help to build the pyramids is
one thing but where does it end
believing that election fraud is real
believing 9 11 was an inside job worse
if you were feeling particularly
mean-spirited you could suggest that
Netflix knows this and has gone out of
its way to court the conspiracy
theorists
ah so there it is if you question the
narrative from mainstream archaeologists
the fear is that it might send you
tumbling down a rabbit hole where you
begin to think critically and
skeptically about a whole host of other
topics as well
like election integrity
this is indeed a dangerous possibility
dangerous anyway to the people in charge
of formulating and disseminating the
official narrative
I mean this is really the sin that
Graham Graham Hancock has committed he's
pointing out holes in the official story
he's encouraging skepticism
now the theories that he formulates may
have many holes of their own I think
they do but that's not the issue as far
as the narrative Gatekeepers are
concerned
I mean they don't care if something is
wrong they themselves are wrong all the
time wrongness is not a problem for them
the problem is when people notice how
little they The Gatekeepers actually
know
how how fragile and tentative their own
theories are
how unearned and unjustified is their
confidence
that's what makes a documentary series
about ancient archeology dangerous
is that it might make you a little
skeptical of The Gatekeepers
which I guess is dangerous yeah but it's
the right kind of dangerous
and that is why it's not Graham Hancock
who's canceled today but The Gatekeepers
trying to shame and silence him they are
all canceled that'll do it for this
portion of the show as we move over to
the members block hope to see you there
if not talk to you tomorrow Godspeed

you're really not quite the contrary
how wrong could we possibly be hello
internet
welcome to film theory the show that
tells jokes that ooze with such ease but
those jokes are filled with such
cheese that the joke police might one
day raid my home and say
freeze the keyboard they'll seize the
lawsuits they'll tease and by now you're
all shouting stop
please today we're talking about a dr
seuss classic the lorax the classic tale
of how a flourishing forest full of
truffula trees was reduced to a barren
wasteland when a businessman rolls into
town and exploits the trees for profit
it's a classic story about how something
beautiful that everyone love
can be ruined by greedy corporate
interest and what better way for
illumination entertainment
creator of the minion movies to teach
that very lesson to a new generation
than by taking the iconic story and
adding an extra
hour of run time now some people might
call this an unnecessary
cash grab that totally negates the
message of the original story
what were you expecting a butt at the
end of that sentence it totally negates
the original message of the story but
not nearly as much as the decision to
take the pro-environmentalist icon lorax
and use them to promote
a mazda suv not hybrid or electric or
anything like that just a gas guzzling
suv and also hp
printers and ihop and freaking comcast
you see this this right here it's called
the point illumination entertainment
you missed it but see they're not alone
because when it comes to the lorax movie
audiences missed the point too and to be
clear i'm talking about that movie
itself and
all of the stuff that was shoved into it
to stretch that 30 minute story into 85
minutes of run time the lorax film
seems to have a message that's pro-tree
ending with a big musical about how we
all need to let it grow but if you
really look at what's
actually happening in this movie neither
the once-ler
nor the new villain aloysius oh hey
are to blame and yes i sang it's the way
i remember how to pronounce his name
every song in this movie is a bop movie
itself yeah
questionable quality but man the songs
are just delightful obnoxious for
everyone involved
unclear anyway the villains of this
movie aren't the villains here
rejoice all you once slur and greedler
shippers
how ba can they be not as bad as you
might think you see
meanwhile the characters that the movie
is trying to cast in the role of heroes
aren't quite as heroic as they might
seem the long and short of it all is
that no one
understood this story which is just a
wee bit concerning since in a very
literal way the fate of the world
depends upon its message
for starters let's take a look at the
main villain of the story as you may or
may not know the classic story of the
lorax is about the once-ler an
enterprising businessman who chops down
all of the truffula trees to manufacture
these wildly popular garments called
these but in this new lorax movie that's
all in the past it's a story within a
story in the present day of the film
we're living in the aftermath of the
once-ler
there are zero trees and the one city
that we see
needville is a synthetic consumerist
mecca run by a new businessman who's
come to power
aloysius o'hare who built his empire on
selling bottled air
while mr o'hara officially is a
businessman he basically just runs the
works for place and he has his own
secret police that try to stop our main
character ted when he attempts to sneak
out of town
cenidevil is basically a corporatocracy
a word that sounds like it was made up
in a dr seuss book but nope
it's uh actually right here in the
dictionary because truth is more
ridiculous than fiction sometimes the
business model of o'hare's air company
we're told is that
bottled air is made in a factory which
manufactures plastic bottles
you gotta be kidding me you really think
people are stupid enough to buy this
our research shows that if you put
something in a plastic bottle
people will buy it of course there's an
obvious conflict of interest here the
factories that manufacture o'hare's
plastic bottles spew smog which in turn
drives more people to buy
bottled air the more smog in the sky
the more people will bomb but if you
take a closer look at what's going on
o'hare might not be the villain that the
movie sets him out to be
because as much as what i've described
sounds like a dystopia if you look at
the actual lives led by the people in
sneedville the movie actually tells us a
completely different story for starters
the most dystopian part of this might be
the idea that people are paying for air
it'd be pretty dang evil if o'hare
monopolized the most vital resource of
all and then locked it behind a paywall
forcing people to pay him if they want
to live but that's not what's happening
here
it's not as if everyone in this society
is spending their lives strapped to an
oxygen tank sure
some of them buy bottled air for their
homes but they can just go outside at
any point and breathe the air for free
in fact on the extended version of the
opening song that appears on the
soundtrack
o'hare straight up tells us this fact
something they can get for free and it's
not as if the air outside looks all that
polluted people are dancing and singing
in the streets without having any health
concerns they're not coughing they're
not struggling in any sort of way
compare that to what the town was like
before aloysius o'hare showed up you got
yourself a different story i wonder what
the next million dollar invention's
gonna be
yeah i wonder the air quality was so bad
that people
outside were indeed coughing and
wheezing
what i'm getting at is that though
people act as though this bottled air is
something that they need in order to
breathe the bottled air they buy
isn't really improving the quality of
the air that they have access to in
their homes or outside
it is pure placebo effect and we can
prove it using science take a closer
look at those bottled air machines
inside of people's homes we see that
they dispense air from bottles that are
similar to the standard water cooler
bottles which are around 5 gallons or 19
liters in capacity and
something about that should strike you
is off the average human breathes around
7 to 8 liters of air
every minute which is more than ten
thousand liters of air per day
meaning that if the citizens of the
needville were solely reliant on
o'hare's jugs of air they would run out
in mere
minutes sure they might get themselves
some psychological boost from thinking
that o'hare's air is breathing fresher
but it's just that it's psychology
not biology the fresh air that they're
buying from o'hare is no different from
the fresh air they'd get if they simply
opened up a window
wow it's kind of like another resource
we have in real life that's
available to us that many opt to pay for
because it comes in tiny plastic bottles
that claim to be fresher
go figure i'm talking about water here
guys thought the metaphor was obvious
enough but i feel like i need to spell
it out bottled water
o'hare's air is just the stand-in for
bottled water but one thing we
can say is that before o'hare the town
was a wasteland thanks in large part to
the once-ler cutting down trees in the
present day of the movie
needville is an artificially created
utopia where
everyone is happy where the air is
cleaner than anything that exists around
it we
saw how much of a wasteland it was
before o'hare and in the present day we
see ted cough on smog-filled air when he
leaves the city's walls
as ted gets further away from the city
the more air pollution there seems to be
if anything thineville is the one place
that seems to have escaped from this
fate
somehow by hooker by crook aloysius
o'hare managed to create what is
by all accounts a thriving city despite
the lack of trees he found a way to
allow people to breathe
free air even when they're not consuming
his bottled air if you look at it that
way o'hare
almost seems like a hero at the end of
the movie when we look out over the
ruined wasteland it's important to
understand
that isn't what o'hare created it's what
he had to
overcome for his company and town to be
successful
and he did it the people are happy as we
see in the opening song of the movie his
consumers are clearly thriving happy
about him
happy about the city they live in
welcoming his entrance and the city's
new parking lot in a grand chorus
in fact if you actually look at the
living conditions of people in
sneedville it seems
not bad at all for a movie that's
supposed to be all about the woes of
modernity and the harm brought by
capitalistic greed we don't see
anyone in sneedville that seems to be a
real victim of o'hare's enterprises
we don't see people who are left poor
and destitute we don't see people who
are forced to work jobs that they don't
like in order to keep up with the rat
race or worse yet in order to breathe
people happily prance around while
they're on the job and everyone seems to
have tons of time for leisure and enough
money to buy
giant cars the inciting incident of the
film where ted goes off in search of a
tree
isn't because someone is actually
suffering from a lack of trees it's
because he wants a kiss from audrey the
hot girl next door that he has a crush
on what i want more than
anything in the whole world is to see
a real living tree if a guy
somehow got you one well i'd probably
marry him on the spot
heck she's not even pining for nature
she doesn't want to see a forest she
just wants to see a tree in her backyard
for the funsies for the novelty of it
these are the concerns of the people of
the needville
it ain't too shabby so o'hare doesn't
really seem to be that much of a bad guy
here sure he doesn't want to grow the
tree at the end of the movie but outside
of that he took a desolate polluted
wasteland and turned it into a
consumerist utopia where everyone is
happy sure
he's rich but he's rich off of producing
a product that people were willing to
pay for
so if o'hara isn't the bad guy then
surely the bad guy is the one slur
i'm not bad i'm the good guy here looks
like someone's seen an episode of film
theory before but seriously it's hard to
defend this guy considering he's
definitely the one to blame for all the
trees being cut down
kind of i mean technically it was his
overbearing mother who pushed him to the
brink
see we're not making sneeds fast enough
we could always start
chopping down the trees man it is no
wonder that tumbler fell in love with
this guy he's a tall
thin guitar playing nerd who wears vests
loves marshmallows and has mommy issues
you always said i wouldn't amount to
anything remember oh hush your mouth
that was just trying to motivate you
i'm really glad that you clarified that
because it actually hurt my feelings for
a really long time but yeah at the end
of the day it's old onesie who's
responsible for chopping down the trees
which is bad
so thus he is the villain except we see
his backstory he sets off on his own to
make a business because he has a product
that he believes in
garbage oh no oh no
you do not get it this is a
revolutionary product
that will change the world as we know it
it is a million uses
and nobody believes in him nobody but
nobody's gonna buy that thing he goes to
town
every day for a week and just gets
harassed by the awful terrible people
there like it is brutal for just this
one guy in his guitar and a dream and
yet despite
all of this adversity he still keeps
trying and you know what it eventually
pays off
onceler wasn't wrong his product is
something that everyone wants
the thnead is the world world-changing
product that he thought it was i'm sorry
i just can't fault a hard-working guy
with a dream who overcomes adversity to
achieve tremendous success
as the bad guy in this case his one
fault and this
is a biggie is that he doesn't replace
the trees and that's not
evil it's just stupid and bad business
as he too quickly learns without trees
his business dies there's a reason why
in real life 80 to 90
of newly planted trees are planted by
logging and paper companies to quote
from one of their websites how would it
be in their best interest to destroy
forests with no intention of replacing
the trees that are used to make paper
sustainability of harvestable areas is
crucial to the long-term survival of any
paper company and that means that
sustainable
managed forests are crucial to their
business model the harvested areas for
paper companies are also known as
managed forests essentially detailed
models are built that allow trees to be
harvested sustainably for each tree
that's cut down
several are planted or naturally regrown
in its place
at a rate that keeps the environment
stable according to the u.s forest
service
over 4 million trees are planted in the
united states
every day with nearly 2 million planted
by the paper
and wood products industries remember mr
beast's team trees 20 million dollars
for 20 million trees
amazing accomplishment right and it was
but in perspective that's
five days worth of planting for these
companies
the businesses aren't evil or at the
very least aren't evil for those reasons
their business interests force them to
be sustainable
and that is the once-ler's big mistake
he didn't see the forest for the trees
if you'll pardon the pun so who is the
villain of the lorax
it's the consumer it's us it's easy to
point at the big business guys
in this case the once-ler and aloysius
o'hare and say you did this you're the
one at fault for all of this but
they're only doing what we as the
consumer are telling them to do
both o'hare and the once-ler reference
the consumer at various points
throughout the movie
you gotta be kidding me you really think
people are stupid enough to buy this
can we fold him for selling us a product
that we're telling him we want he
doesn't believe it but if that's what we
want
he'll sell it to us and again with the
once-ler how bad could i possibly be
all the customers are paying and the
money's multiplying
the customers are buying that is us
telling him we approve of what you're
doing keep providing
that service again both men are just
fulfilling a need that the consumer is
telling them that they want for more
proof
onceler was ready to pack up his need
business when it wasn't selling but
ramps it up again when consumer demand
is through the roof if it wasn't for all
of those people wanting to buyeth need
the forest would still be intact from
what we see
and hear in the movie the people of the
needville are perfectly happy with their
giant cars
and their inflatable trees and their
waste of batteries
they want those things and you know what
they don't want trees
stop it one slur and o'hare aren't the
bad guys like the movie wants to frame
it it's much more complicated than that
we're the bad guys here because we are
the ones that let their bad business
practices slide
we didn't prioritize nature we didn't
care about the trees because we wanted a
need no matter the cost we didn't care
about air quality to worry about
o'hare's pollution for change to happen
it doesn't fall on them it falls on us
and if we disapprove of the way someone
is doing business or what a company
stands for
it's up to the consumer to vote with
their dollar but to both o'hare and
once-ler in the movie the dollars thus
far had been telling him we approve what
you're doing
that's why this line in the movie and in
the book is so important
because unless someone like you cares a
whole awful lot
nothing is going to get better it's not
about the once-ler it's not about o'hare
it's about us
and that is the message of the lorax one
that i think most people
and especially illumination
entertainment completely missed but

to find out more about why snipers were
so effective in Stalingrad Janet I went
to the British Army's sniper training
center in Wales
I would take on the role of a German
commander and Dan would be part of a
soviet sniper team what we have to set
up here Peter is your headquarters and
it would be far enough back from the
frontline to provide you with some
limited protection but it would be close
enough for you to influence the battle
my headquarters also had radio operators
working inside and a machine gunner to
protect me the tasks for Dan and his
sniper team was to disable the
headquarters either by shooting me for
my team in this exercise it would count
as a hit if the sniper could identify
the letter written on my helmet and then
far a blank run we also gave a letter to
the machine-gun century said the targets
were Q Quebec and D Delta
a sniper's first job was to find a
hiding place from where they can fire
the enemy so what are you seeing Dean
anything suspicious no yet keep looking
hopefully we'll better locate anyone
that's out there any suspicious movement
it could be anywhere a sniper in there
it could be anyone yeah
it would have been extremely difficult
in a large city that being so devastated
like Stalingrad to identify a sniper
moving around an imposition we'd managed
to get into our building without being
spotted
but to stay hidden where to change our
camouflage to blend in with the new
environment just like the snipers in
Stalingrad I think they would have
something just like they said they would
get different colors paint wood dirt and
just just paint the whole thing go and
in mind all the contacts all the firings
that was a really short distance so the
better they could blend in the better
for them even detective our plan was
that rather than attacking the front we
would cover the rear exit from the
headquarters ok you can see straight
from there that is a target area looks
to be like an age
it was now just a question of sitting
and waiting but without losing my
concentration as I'm sitting here I'm
realizing that one of the real
challenges to being a sniper is
maintaining that focus and the guys at
Stalingrad would be doing that for a day
or even longer and you just don't know
when the targets going to appear and as
a result you could it be you know as a
on edge the whole time
while we kept watch at the back to more
snipers the rest of our team climbed
into position in a small building
directly in front of their headquarters
but if they were in one of these
buildings they'd be using the shadow
inside the building to hide themselves
set back from the window nice and still
the team at the front were now in
position they decided to attack the
machine gunner because he was the most
immediate threat enemy on target saying
don't wait if he's a reasonably trained
sniper who's well practiced that you
would pretty much guarantee a hit with
the first round range 225 metres should
be able to achieve a shot on to your
center of mass at approximately 900
meters 900 900 meters short from Chester
hood
send it
don't talk it down we've got some
movement that would confirm kill
inside the building I thought I would be
safe from the snipers confirm one kill
don't age down all of the course I've
moved into the building with our target
inside the building we decided to use a
tactic used by snipers in Stalingrad we
called in artillery fire on today's
headquarters to force him out into the
open to Delta all call signs in building
request alpha 1 1 alpha fires x-ray zero
zero one five now of them
it would only be a matter of time before
got a direct hit from the mortise on to
this location we've got to move okay we
decided to move to our vehicle at the
back of the building and use smoke to
hide ourselves from the snipers at the
front
we now have smoke being front obscuring
of you
wolf is getting rather close
yeah I can see a queue on his head and a
shot add a shot here from somewhere over
there good this is where I think I might
have been dared so that's me done for
absolutely I'd no idea we were no idea
at all
we could see you know absolutely I mean
well it was quite funny because I had
absolutely no idea where you guys were
just demonstrates how a very small
number of people lightly equipped can
keep a serious command post in real
trouble
oh really really quite terrifying it
must have been

if you thought Don't Hug Me I'm Scared
was the most disturbing stuff on YouTube
think again ain't that right Salad
Fingers
cubicle fancy seeing you here
hello Internet welcome to film Theory
giving myself nightmares just to explain
a decades-old web series and that's no
exaggeration I have been wrecked for a
week working on this thing but man what
a rewarding series it is to analyze so
as we prepare to hop right in let's
start with some context starting in 2004
and finally ending in 2013 with just 10
short episodes Salad Fingers was
successfully able to terrify a
generation making it one of the founding
fathers of online video Terror I kid you
not I remember being in high school and
everyone daring each other to watch the
first episode of this the next day kids
would come back racked I'll admit it the
build up for how scary this thing was
was so strong that I actually didn't
watch it only just picking it up this
year to finally satisfy my curiosity
thinking hey I've grown up a bit this
shouldn't be nearly as scary as it was
when we were back in high school but I
was definitely wrong freakish imagery
gut-wrenching sound design in an
unsettling story all packaged and stiff
inhuman animations in the way only early
Flash videos can animate it was and
still is the stuff of nightmares yet
despite its obvious scare Factor what's
less obvious is the series plot with so
much of the story being told in
fractured Pieces by unreliable
characters using abstract symbols what's
actually going on here is a bit of a
question the visuals and sound may be
the stuff of nightmares but the story
here is the stuff of theories which
means after all of these years of
avoiding watching it myself it's now my
turn to dare you to watch The Salad
Finger series if you haven't yet and if
you think you can handle it by clicking
right here it's a little under an hour
and it's well worth it to not only
understand this Theory but witness some
of the most influential early flash
animations online plus with Halloween
around the corner it'll give you some
spooky fun alright write a toss some
salad let's go now when trying to
analyze something as abstract as Salad
Fingers we have to start with with the
most basic questions and work from there
so where is this story set well we see
Salad Fingers roaming a mostly Barren
Wasteland filled with strange mutants
and burned out houses leading many to
think that this is a post-apocalyptic
Universe however based on context clues
we can get a lot more specific when
discussing his earlier life Salad Finger
says I used to sing
it's all the functions
from croxleyheath to Cowden baith both
of which are real world locations in the
United Kingdom he mentions Croxley again
this time saying that he listened to it
on the radio in episode 8. if I'm an
early bird I listen to Croxley so we
know that he lives in the UK but we can
also identify the year in episode 6
present the titular present that he
receives is a toy horse that he refers
to as my very own Harris house color
note that he says my very own Horus
horse collar meaning that horse horse
collar is already something in existence
and indeed he is Horus horse collar was
the name of a cheerful know-it-all
cartoon character created by Walt Disney
back in 1929 as a partner to Mickey
Mouse in all of his adventures basically
he was like the earlier version of goofy
appearing in animations between 1929 and
1942 but we can narrow that range
further as we hear Salad Fingers sing
both the songs somewhere over the
rainbow and we'll meet again at various
points throughout the series two songs
both released in 1939 and 1939 is a
crucial year since it falls right
between World War One and the start of
World War II throughout salad fingers
are leafy green hero talks frequently
about the Great War from the Great Wall
to leave for the Great Wall without me
with various characters coming back from
the war including Kenneth his younger
brother who happens to be a corpse lying
in a ditch and Jeremy Fisher one of his
finger puppets more on both of them a
little bit later salad also laments that
Kenneth must return to the trenches the
major fighting style of the first world
war it's also worth remembering that in
between the two Wars no one called it
World War one since no one knew a second
one was coming just a few decades later
as such while the U.S referred to it as
the European War during those years
britons preferred calling it The Great
War at least they did up until the 1940s
based on all of this evidence we know
that salad fingers is set in a version
of the UK in 1939. one still grappling
with the very real effects of the first
world war but right before the outbreak
of the second one who said a weird web
series about rubbing rust-covered
objects with your grotesque Leaf fingers
wouldn't be educational and here's where
it's interesting because remember based
on Horace horse collar and the two songs
he sings the time we spend with Salad
Fingers is at least 1939 which is 20
years after the end of the Great War and
yet he talks about it like it's still
going on he's delusional mentally stuck
in the past it's also important to note
that we see background paintings of
normal people and places like the one in
episode 1 as well as this one of a
church in episode 5 from flashbacks we
can see that salad fingers has
experienced things like hair salons so
there is a real world here a real world
filled with actual normal looking people
like the kid in episode 2 and his picnic
partner in episode 5. in short the
post-apocalyptic Wasteland filled with
irradiated mutants that salad fingers
wanders through is not reality as many
other theories believe it's how he sees
the world very clearly there is a moment
in his life during the Great War that
caused him to have a break from the
existing reality and he's entered a
state of Arrested Development ever since
which means that things start to get
complicated in a a hurry because not
only is he lost in time but his
personality is also jumbled while it
would be easy to lump all of salad
finger's actions onto one person he
actually shows himself to hop between
various characters and backstories
without realizing it for instance when
speaking with Kenneth he laments being
left behind as the rest of the boys went
out to the Great War it was fried
favorite a few blacks
to leave the Great Wall without me but
then two episodes later we see him
writing the equivalent of a teacher's
note explaining why he can't come to the
front today implying that he's already
been there
I sharped be able to attend the war
today not to mention him speaking fluent
French nebula
in understanding Morse code both skills
a soldier would likely have from his
time during the war but made especially
stranger since he shows that he can
neither read nor write as evidenced by
his failed letter writing in episode 9
his made-up letter reading earlier in
that same episode and his willful
disregard for Harry the barbecue man's
name tag in episode 2 instead choosing
to name him Milford cubicle and then
joyfully play the flute for him like I
said this series is so weird we also
clearly see him giving voice to his own
baby ah that's a shame you were doing a
first-rate job and repeatedly slipping
into the Persona of a flirtatious girl
hitting on Sailors back for Shore leave
they'll be troubled in the Peyton's
quarters maybe he can come and tuck me
in tonight's silence stop that talking
about washing his petticoats probably
enough water in here to wash my
petticoats which is a girl's underskirt
just so you know not many of the beauty
gurus talking about their petticoats
these days and also repeatedly hopping
into dresses whether to sing on stage or
get himself married then in the final
episode he enters the forest hoping to
find a doctor to look at Milford cubicle
who yes gesso happens to wind up as a
corpse hanging from the wall leave a
duty to fetch the doctor since our
wandering guest has fallen ill and once
the doctor is found claims the
Examination for himself I suppose you'll
be checking me we also see moments where
Salad Fingers clearly switches from one
Persona to the next for getting the name
of one of his favorite puppets Hubert
cumberdale and having to make up a new
one why if it isn't
um
Logan price forgetting that he intended
to give his baby away to Auntie
Bainbridge and deciding to clean the
windows instead good old Auntie
Bainbridge has agreed to take care of
you I'm just here
to
clean your windows and with a clear
change in Attitude indicated by his
facial shift as the doctor brutalizes
the horse during the final scenes of
episode 10.
I know it hurts in short solving the
story of Salad Fingers isn't just
figuring out what's going on for one
character it's figuring out the numerous
people's fingers gives voice to decoding
what they're saying and then deciding
how those actions all fit into one
overall narrative and that's quite a
Monumental task so let's actually start
with one of the easiest of those
characters which is his younger brother
Kenneth in episode 7 labeled Shore leave
the puppet Hubert cumberdale digs up a
dead body whose Salad Fingers identifies
as his brother back on leave from the
Great War already you can see how salad
here is a little bit of a tossed salad
as he attributes the digging of the hole
to Hubert a finger puppet rather than
himself giving us further evidence that
he switches between personalities
blacking out what happens in those
moments from his own memories now during
his brother's visit salad Marvels at the
women his brother must have chaste
recounts details of his own personal
singing career and then ends the visit
by kicking Kenneth back into the hole so
he can return to the trenches and resume
his Call of Duty it's about as pleasant
of a visit as you can expect from a
half-desicated corpse except there's one
flashback in the middle of that visit
that's awfully suspicious Salad Fingers
leads into the Flashback by telling a
story of how he and his brother used to
fight the Riverside we then hear a
typical flashback transition and what we
see instead is our green friend rolling
out a measuring wheel and talking to a
tree
[Music]
today not quite frolicking by the river
with his brother right well maybe it is
what if his brother is the tree or more
accurately what if his brother is buried
under the tree I propose to you that the
younger brother Kenneth never fought in
the War at all and instead died young
perhaps even in childbirth only to be
buried under this tree 21 yards away
from Salad Fingers front door and Beyond
just the obvious is Flashback there are
smaller Clues to this being the true
story first notice that the episode is
labeled Shore leave and yet Salad
Fingers says Kenneth is headed back to
the trenches as a member of the U.S
Royal Navy Kenneth shouldn't be dealing
with trenches as his battles would be
mostly fought at Sea so either it's a
factual error here or a fabricated
memory by Salad Fingers dreaming up his
dead younger brother as some sort of war
hero getting all the ladies but that's
not all let's look at the tree itself
you see this wouldn't be the only time
that we see this tree associated with
babies during a dream sequence at the
top of episode nine Salad Fingers has a
conversation with that same tree which
now Sprouts a face and complains about
wanting to come inside to escape the
cold the difference though is that this
time the tree calls him daddy
and when Salad Fingers refuses to help
Mr branches saying that the baby needs
to grow out of its branches to come
inside it wraps itself around its
stomach ending the dream and leading to
a scene where fingers actually gives
birth in fact when you look across all
10 of Salad Fingers episodes baby
imagery is everywhere from Salad Fingers
finding a baby carriage for his Nettles
and starting to lactate in episode 3 to
him being attacked by the baby tree and
literally giving birth in episode 9 but
probably the clearest place that we see
it is in episode 4 cage where Salad
Fingers is literally followed around by
an embryo and that's no exaggeration
just look at this thing the large folded
over forehead the veins visible Under
the Skin it looks exactly like a baby in
the womb it even makes baby noises
throughout the episode
but the giveaway here is in the eyes
Salad Fingers may be abstract in its art
style but it's not sloppy with its
imagery be careful attention to the eyes
of the characters who appear throughout
the series The Living characters like
salad fingers anti-bainbridge varsity
jacket kit and Milford cubicle prior to
his death all have normal looking eyes
the puppets all have button-like eyes
and this guy is the only one to have
misshapen black dots just like the eyes
of a developing embryo I mean just
compare the two look at an embryo look
at this character they are one and the
same but what does it all mean well in
cage we see salad clearly disturbed by
this thing following him around he
starts the episode eager to find France
because as he says I've always wanted to
get over there but once he realizes he's
being chased by the embryo he
immediately puts off his goal for
another day returning home to hide and
it's not like this thing is menacing
quite the contrary he's actually
incredibly friendly with hearts
appearing around it when it speaks to
Salad Fingers and proposing to him with
a ring sure it also lures him out of the
house with a grubby tap leading him to a
bear trap and locking him into that
titular cage but hey it was for love I
swear I did It All for Love the episode
ends with salad disappearing flying away
on a tap once again wearing his Beret to
find France while the embryo sits there
and cries it's a bizarre sequence but
also one that seems pretty literal
between this and the tree it's the
second time that we see Salad Fingers
actively walking away from babies
looking for affection in fact the
presence of the baby prevents Salad
Fingers from pursuing his dream of
finding France and literally traps him
which shows how salad's psyche views
having kids it's a metaphor that
continues in episode 9 where having baby
Yvonne starts as a happy moment but then
quickly turns sour as the baby doesn't
listen to him and instead slowly starts
to kill him to the point that the
enfeebled salad fingers is stuck in a
wheelchair and decides to give her away
time and time again throughout this
series we see Salad Fingers turning away
from children running away from them
trapped by them and in some instances
outright killing them as is the case
with the boy that he accidentally locks
in the oven one of the few events in the
series that we can actually confirm is a
real occurrence since we see the letter
from his letterman jacket buried in a
pile of junk Midway through the final
episode but what does it all mean well
at this point we've covered about half
the episodes meaning that there's still
quite a bit to go and the hardest
questions are yet to come including the
identities of his mysterious finger
puppets and the super dark imagery of
the final ending so I know you're gonna
hate me for it but I have to call this
one a two-parter so first make sure that
you're notified for part two rub your
salad Mouse over this Rusty subscribe
button so that you don't miss the upload
just so you guys don't get all upset at
me in the comments again let me just
clarify that I separate things out into
two parters for a bunch of reasons
mostly so I don't have to rush through
all the information as you can see
there's a lot to talk about in Salad
Fingers and I don't want to skip things
or cut a bunch out just to fit it into
the typical 13 to 20 minute episode
length why not make it longer you ask
and that's a legitimate question but
there are a few reasons first it already
takes around 80 hours to edit these
videos together so longer videos are
just brutal for Thomas Edward Ronnie and
sedge that's actually why I work with so
many editors because the episodes think
so long to make we have to rotate
between everyone to make sure that the
episodes come out on a regular basis but
not only that I've seen the data on how
you guys watch these episodes once an
episode is over 17 minutes people tend
to cut out early so going far over 20
minutes is gonna mean that a lot of
people miss all the cool stuff that we
all worked really hard to show you guys
and lastly YouTube demands regular
videos and if you want to really grow
and stay relevant in today's YouTube you
really should be releasing stuff every
day now obviously we can't do that but
we do try our best to stay regular at
ethereal week that said if I take two
weeks off to work on one video YouTube
system will freak out and start
punishing the channel I hope that you
guys understand and I hope that you've
subscribed since I really want you to
see how this whole series wraps up this
thing is dark that's about it for this
week now if you'll excuse me I have to
go rub my finger on some Rusty Spoons it
feels so good on my salad fingers

I remember like my first computer was a
Pentium 100 megahertz. I would be in
school and then a friend in school say 'I
got a computer that's like 233 megahertz'
and then like 'how! I just bought mine -
mine is new and then now you have something that
is like twice and a little bit more
faster'. But that's how it happened for a
long time this is that the hardware,
every two years, it would get, for example,
our CPUs, every two years, it would get
twice faster and for software
engineering in general what it meant for
programmers, developers, is that if you
write a code today and then don't do
anything with this code, two years later
you would have the opportunity to run
this code twice faster but this is no
longer true today so what it means that
before we had only one CPU that was
getting faster and faster but now it
needs to have multiple of them and that
actually changes the way we write
software and the language that we can
see, there are mainstream languages, they are
not as efficient, as effective as it
could be.
Imagine that, you know, like in the 80's,
the telephones, it's really getting
widespread, everybody's installing a
phone. If I have a city with millions of
people, right, you need to install a bunch
of telephone switches and you have calls
coming all the time, right, then the calls
going out, so information is coming and
going. When it's working hours I have
much more people using the phones,
right, and all this kind of stuff. So they have to
solve this problem three decades ago - and
they did! So what happened is that
Erickson, they created Erlang, this
technology that they created, right, in
the eighties, to solve all these problems,
it's going to be perfect to solve those
issues that we're having right now with
concurrency, those issues that we're
having with the web in general, right? I
think that was the moment when I had the
idea of creating a programming language. Like, 
look I have this absolutely beautiful
piece of software which is the
Erlang virtual machine. I want to use it more
but it's missing some stuff and I want
to try adding this missing stuff. So in
2012, it was the moment that I started
working on Elixir part time and I think
we can use the software to expose an
alternative for the programming
community if they are interested in
solving all those challenges that we're
having right now.
You can do everything on the internet.
You can find everything, you can book
everything, but it's still in silos so
you will find your flights on Skyscanner
and Kayak; you will find your your red
connections on Bahn DE. Here you have to
figure out: how do I get to the airport?
How much will my transition time will be?
What is the prices of different
tickets from different airports and so
on, and the we thought it would be a
great idea to have this in one UI. You
would enter your direction and you
will enter your destination and we find
the whole itinerary. We immediately
realize that this is something that is
very hard to do. For every search that we
do we have to open a lot of connections
to different transport operators. We have
a lot of connections open at the same
time to different operators and you have
to consume this data and process it in a
smart way and it has to be fast. This was
basically the point where we thought
about what technology is the right
technology to go for. One of the
characteristics that we were looking for
was scalability. We literally have tens
of thousands of connections open all the
time and in both directions and this is
one thing that Elixir is very good for
us and very low in terms of the
resources you need on the server side. We
pretty fast came to the conclusion that
Elixir is the right technology for our
problem.
We used, of course, job boards like Honeypot and others to find people. We also
basically train people that did
something else before and train them to
Elixir.
Of course we have some hiccups sometimes, in the code or we have some bugs that
we created but we never had outages in
terms of the infrastructure which is for
me a very good indication that this is
the right technology decision because I
never experienced this before.
So one of the big things about Elixir
and we get exactly from building on top of
Erlang VM is that we can write
distributed software software: software that runs
in more than one machine. So you can see
here I have two machines and so what I'm
going to do is that I'm going to start one
Elixir session on this machine and
another Elixir session on this machine.
So in this one I'm starting something
called interactive Elixir on both of
them but this one, this is Bob's machine, so
I'm going to say, hey these Elixir
and this has the name of Bob and we
have a secret here; a cookie, which is a
secret, but we'll just call it secret
right now. So I'm going to start this
session here on Bob and I'm going to do
the same thing on Alice so I'm starting
Alice at a session with the same
cookie secret. Alright, the only way to
do this is that I'm going to define some
Elixir code and I know this is
a little bit cliche, right, but I'm going
to define a module called 'hello'. We have a
function called 'world' in it and I'm going
to, and what all this function does is
that it prints 'hello world'.
So I define this code, ignored the whole
gibberish for now, but I define this code
and now I can code 'hello' dot 'world',
and you can see that it prints 'hello
world'. Beautiful,
right? So, it works. This is very exciting.
So this is Bob's computer but now
let's go to Alice's computer. If I try to
evoke 'hello world', it doesn't work. Why?
Because I defined this code. I defined
the module 'hello' with the function 'world' on
only Bob's computer, but we can solve
this, right, because it's distributed I
can make those machines talk to each
other. So what I'm going to do here is
that I'm going to say hey I want on
Alice's machine she's going say 'hey, I'm
going to tell Bob to execute this code
for me' so I would say, 'hey, Bob', the Bob
instance that is running on Bob's machine,
'I want you to execute the 'hello world'
code' and now when I do this we can see
that we got 'hello world' printed back, we
can see that it works right because
Alice was able to tell Bob 'execute this
code for me'. Bob executed that code
and said, 'hey, I executed this code
and this code has a hello world message
that I'm sending back to you so you can
print' and that's it.
And what is really exciting about this
is that we can build a bunch of
interesting technology that just runs on
these nodes being connected. So for
example, the Phoenix web framework it has
a presence feature and has a Pub/Sub
mechanism. So with the PubSub, what you can
do is that you can send the messages to
everybody connected to any machine and
with the presence feature you can know
everybody who is connected in the
whole cluster. You can know who is
joining, who is leaving and we can do all
that without adding databases, without
adding third party dependencies. We just
use the distributed feature which is
really exciting. One of the things that
we did since the beginning is that the
development was always open; always open
source. So anybody could join at any
time and give their ideas, contribute
share. So I also knew from the beginning
that if I wanted this thing to happen I
would have to go out and talk to a lot
of people and go to different events and
convince developers why they should care
about the technology; one of the
potentials of the technology and got
them excited about it. We really started
to see like an uptick in people using a
Elixir and that was kind of like the
beginning of a turning point because of
like, people, they're actually
starting to bet on this so you don't
feel alone in the sense that you know
there are other people believing in the
potential wanting to push it forward. And
you know, that the interest, it only
started to grow and grow. In July 2014
was when we had the first Elixir event.
There's such a great vibe, everybody gets
along and it's so easy to be able to
just approach anybody that's there to
ask questions.
When I started with
Elixir, I was amazed by the
documentation that even was available at
that time.
Elixir is always typically thought of as being great for concurrency and
fast and so if you're kind of solving
those kind of problems then it's a
really good choice.
Whether you're building something to run
on a Raspberry Pi zero, five dollar
computer or a forty core server, like
Elixir is going to be fantastically
suited for it.
You can't exactly replicate
the environment in which people from the
community are all in the single place.
Elixir is gonna be on a track to start
to conquer more and more industries.
Some of the obvious ones that we've seen so
far have been working with web
development but the scalability there
isn't just confined to building websites.
We work together with Chris and Jose
from the nerve side of things to be able
to try to increase the number of
concurrent connections and push the
boundaries of how many devices we can
actually get simultaneously connected to
Phoenix, for example, because we really
believe that it has capabilities of
Internet of Things connectivity on the
scale of millions of devices and having
that kind of connectivity starts to
really open up the language and the
industry to start working in all these
different kinds of ways.
Phoenix is a web
framework for the electric programming
language and it really is like a
batteries included web framework for the
platform. The first version of Phoenix,
as written, supported like 30,000 users
on one server and then we made like 10
lines of change to the code and that's
what gave us 2 million users. What kind
of problems or businesses could I build
if what before took 100 servers could
today take two servers and
I think that's enabling a lot of
innovation. So I think that's what's kind
of bringing people in is this promise of
things that were either impossible to do
before or prohibitively expensive to do.
Now as a single developer or a couple
people you can come in and build
something really compelling that
wouldn't be doable before.
 
 
Right now we are
we are at the Elixir conference in Warsaw.
We see Elixir conferences appearing
all around the world so we have in Mexico,
Brazil, throughout the United States we
have a bunch of smaller conferences
popping up and then there are all the
different talks where we can learn new
things and also which is always very
interesting is to learn like use cases.
You build the two and then people
started using those two in these very different ways. If you're like, 'look, I
actually realized that this, too, is also
very good for these' and then you're like
'it makes sense, like, I watch the talk and
it makes total sense', so,
all those things are very exciting. If I
try to centralize and I try to do
everything on my own I won't be able to
do it but if we say, you know, everybody
can contribute a small part to these and
everybody together, the centralized can
do that and bring the community forward,
then we have a chance of actually making
a lasting impact.
Beautiful.

police responding to reports of a
shooting
tragedy
i got an automated phone message from
the school
that the schools were in lockdown
and then we got the news that there had
been a report
of a shooting at sandy hook school
and i ran out the door i just
i headed to the school quickly
there was a firehouse down the street
from the school where they they were
having everybody assembled and they were
bringing all the students and personnel
out of the school and having this having
us meet there
[Music]
and
my friend melissa
had collected her
second grader
and um
she asked her husband to
to pick him up and bring him home and i
said to melissa i said you should go
home and be with him and she said no
i'll stay here with you until you get
daniel
and then finally the governor came
and said
if you're missing someone
they didn't survive
[Music]
we have funerals for olivia engel at one
at st rosalina and dylan hockley in
bethel
same thing we've been doing
just be outside respectful distance
is there anything else we need
in newtown daily developments beyond
that happening anything we know there's
nothing else today but dave is gonna be
making some calls
um
yeah one of the teachers
her step father
is a reporter here and i think is sort
of a
defense mechanism i thought it couldn't
be you know we we we'd know already
something and um
eventually
um
it was confirmed so
you know a story that was
difficult enough for all of us to report
anyway was you know that much more
emotional that much more difficult
the sort of
overarching issue that
i'm looking at is whether or not
sandy hook
truly is a tipping point in the debate
over gun violence and that whatever the
solutions are out there these 20
innocent children lost
this will make a difference
and and i'm sort of examining that
optimism against the reality that the
gun control debate in america is
exceedingly divisive
it is a sad honor to be here today
it's been one month since i lost my son
dylan and 25 other families lost their
loved ones
the sandy hook promise is the start of
our change
this is a promise to do everything in
our power to be remembered not as the
town filled with grief and victims
but as the place where real change began
this is a promise
to be open to all possibilities there is
no agenda other than to make our
communities and our nation a safer
better place
yeah uh matthew kaufman with the
hartford current can you give us a sense
of how active you intend to be or do you
anticipate a point at which sandy hook
promise would actually be testifying
lobbying if you will we have to take the
time to educate ourselves we have to
take the time to have that dialogue
but absolutely there's going to become a
moment time where we're going to take
those positions we're a platform for
people to come together with one voice
and actions to move us forward some of
us who came together to start sandy hook
promise our gun owners
we hunt we target shoot we protect our
homes we're collectors we teach our sons
and daughters how to use guns safely
passing a new law and then moving on is
not the answer
we have to fundamentally change our
approach
so that's uh
it's pretty dead center pretty dead
center
a lot of people were surprised at how
many guns nancy lanza owned and the type
of guns that they were
but in fact there's a strong gun culture
in newtown a lot of hunters a lot of
target shooters a lot of gun owners
after december 14th
everybody's been asking has it changed
how i felt about firearms and to be
honest
no
i mean this is how
i thought do you feel yourself sort of
under attack as as a responsible
firearms owner i have friends who are
devout
nra members
who believe that the second amendment
gives everybody the right to own
any firearm
vice versa i have friends here in town
who
believe that all firearms should be
confiscated and destroyed
and i'm somewhere in the middle
as far as a ban on
30 round
clips that that's a it's a common sense
law that would absolutely save lives and
there's going to be a bunch of people
upset that i said that do you feel
uh oh no i'm i'm
betraying
you know the gun enthusiast community
here that uh
i will lose friends
i'm sure of
it we are heading to
the home of a gentleman named scott
ostras ostrovsky
a newtown resident has kind of a
private amateur shooting range on his
property that has been the subject
of a number of complaints by
folks who live in the neighborhood
we've gotten complaints of noise because
we have a neighbor that's been more
sensitive to the shooting in the past
couple years and the police have been
over here many times and they have said
it was safe and we've become buddies
with them there were complaints sort of
from all over the town going to the
police is there something that that
changed a new town yes
a lot more people live here now and a
lot more outsiders have moved in and
these are people that moving to newtown
is big country to them these are people
that in my opinion came from new york
city or the suburbs of new york city or
any urban environment and they're not
used to what goes on in newton or what
has been going on and then you get that
conflict it's just you know growing
pains in a situation like this
each of these red dots represent a home
from which a complaint was lodged with
the police about the sound of gunfire
near these homes i think this was
2010 the first part of 2012.
85 noise complaints related to shooting
spread
pretty broadly throughout the town
so last year the town decided to do
something about it
how are you how are you nice to see you
come in thanks
i think it had just reached sort of a
critical mass of a number of complaints
so
we set this ordinance up and it would
say look you cannot shoot a gun in
newtown unless you're doing legitimate
hunting or you have a legitimate
shooting range did this feel like
controversial
legislation ordinance to you as you were
drafting it did you think not in the
least
absolutely not in the least i never
expected that there would be any
significant opposition to it they had
two public hearings on it
and there were a lot of people there and
they were
very vocal in opposition to the
ordinance
these are the minutes of the meetings
that were held
necessity should be the standard not
simply prudence gunfire is a reminder of
freedom
one person notes that no one in
attendance has spoken in favor
of the ordinance so really you know very
strong emotions
over again what i think the town thought
was a noise ordinance and it all had to
do with their ability to maintain arms
and somehow this would infringe their
second amendment rights any inkling at
all
that you might be uh opening up the
second amendment debate here no because
the second amendment has nothing to do
with shooting ranges it doesn't say the
right to have a shooting range shall not
be infringed
this all happened in the months before
the shootings
and only a handful of people showed up
in support of the ordinance
the town meetings were dominated by
pro-gun enthusiasts
and the ordinance was tabled
and that really illustrated the long
history that newtown has with guns
in fact the trade group for the whole
gun industry is located right here the
national shooting sports foundation
within newtown
is the nssf known
i've talked to a number of people from
town and said had no idea they were here
yeah well connecticut is not well known
now for being a state of great firearms
ownership but ironically connecticut is
where the firearms industry got its
beginning all the major manufacturers of
firearms and ammunition were generally
centered in the connecticut river valley
during the industrial revolution and
that's why the national shooting sports
foundation is in connecticut
2013 marks the 35th anniversary of the
shot show this year over 630
000 square feet of exhibit space and
more than 60 000 industry professionals
ladies and gentlemen
the state of our industry tonight
in a word
is misunderstood
now who among us
has not been moved by that unspeakable
tragedy that was inflicted by a deranged
man upon the children of newtown
connecticut our very home at the nssf
you had said the state of the industry
is misunderstood and what's the biggest
misunderstanding about it
there are many according to the media
we're nothing but a bunch of greedy fat
cats who could care less about anything
but making profit we're in this business
because we love it rather than say that
guns are bad what we say is guns are
here guns are part of the fabric of our
society and so what we need to do is to
make sure that responsible gun owners
make sure that they are not accessible
to children or at-risk individuals if
this woman had safely stored her guns
inaccessible to her son when they were
not in use this shooting would not have
occurred
in the month since 20 precious children
and six brave adults were finally taken
from us at sandy hook elementary
more than 900 of our fellow americans
have reportedly died at the end of a gun
so i'm putting forward
a specific set of proposals
and in the days ahead i intend to use
whatever weight this office holds
to make them a reality
our government is treading a thin thin
line
of becoming tyrannical
and whether it's king george or barack
hussein obama
oppression is oppression
gun control isn't about guns it's about
control
i only have one comment i will not
comply
[Applause]
[Music]
historically with the pro-gun lobby
they've really become entrenched when
challenged one of the questions i think
is do 20 dead first graders change that
equation so far it hasn't and i think
what makes this such an intractable
issue
is even after sandy hook there are
two camps the two camps are what we need
to make our community safer
is fewer guns and the other camp saying
no what we need to make our community
safer is more guns i don't know where
the common ground is
on this when it starts that far apart
we're 48 days
past today when did you start thinking
you have
a larger role to play here
i i
i feel like
we've been forced onto a platform
and i think it i i feel we feel a sense
of responsibility in a field of
obligation a sense of obligation now to
to do whatever we can
we're not political mark and i we're not
you know um
confrontational people
um
but i think we can't we can't allow
ourselves to become complacent and just
say
that's how it is here in the united
states you know these things happen
that's that's unacceptable
[Music]
i have felt guilt and shame about the
fact that in this particular topic i
have never done
a single thing i've been awakened and i
will not be caught napping on the job
from here on out i
just need to do something because i'm
like so many other people
i can't stop thinking about what
happened so
i'm richard morato i have a first grader
at sandy hook by the grace of god she
was shoved in the bathroom along with
her 14 friends and her teacher
i won't begin to tell you the things
that she says and draws right now and
it's progressively getting worse so
anything we can do for our community but
i think we all need to get on the same
page and if someone does speak tomorrow
let's all be on the same page there's a
huge silent majority out there
that i believe is easily motivated not
to be silent anymore if we give them the
tools and that's what we're working
towards
when you go out and you advocate your
power is a thousand one because people
aren't showing up and the fact that
you're from newtown is even more
important i feel like our grief puts us
in a unique position of power and i
actually believe that we can
with that power help level the playing
field with the special interests that
are out there i do think the tide is
turning but our window right now is
extremely limited this is going to move
very very quickly
[Music]
i've never had to wait in line to get in
the legislative office building i've
never had to walk through a metal
detector to get in the legislative
office building so this is most
definitely a moment in my state and the
nation as well
my name is raymond mazza resident of
farmington connecticut
i come here today in strong opposition
of the proposed legislation including
but not limited to
house bill 5268 senate bill 140 senate
bill 122
senate bill 124
and senate bill my daughter was a
student in victoria soto's first grade
class she survived
she and eight other children
ran from that room directly past him
but not before witnessing her friends
and her teacher slaughtered in front of
her so here we are again
another mass shooting another deranged
perpetrator and the response is yet
again banned guns
something needs to change
we need to be able to send our kids to
school without fear as much as you might
detest this thought at the end of the
day the only protection against a bad
man with a gun is a good man or woman
with a gun in the right place at the
right time guns are a fault line in
this sort of varied american experience
and and they
have this capacity to sort of create
this emotional cleave in a way that
i think maybe abortion comes close to
but other than that no other issue
really separates the nation this
substantially if the principal had come
out of her office with a gun in her hand
she might have at least mitigated the
carnage we are incredulous at the types
of assault and semi-automatic weapons
and magazine clips that are considered
legal a lot of people on both sides
think that some change
will come but it will come
not as the result of a meeting of the
minds of these two far apart camps
but simply because one side or the other
musters sufficient political power to
get their way thank you

[Music]
it's getting closer to the road and it's
getting closer to our homes
and slowly being destroyed by this cause
of climate change Max te lives in kirbas
a South Pacific nation whose very
existence is under threat rising sea
levels mean the entire country could
soon become
uninhabitable we're not going to run
from the problems we're going to face it
there are countries in the world who
have islands and they've built their
Islands because they have the two things
they have the technology and they have
the
funds the 120,000 residents of Kira buus
want to stay here and protect themselves
as best as they can but how long can
that
[Music]
last when we were kids the high tide
usually stops maybe from
here here it stops here and now then as
we
are grow growing up the high tide just
moved
moved and now it's hitting the the land
it's hitting the edge and it's
getting it's corrupting everything as
you can
see trees are falling down
not enough sand to hold them and it's
getting close to the road and I think
this not um it's just the beginning
maybe it will keep on going yeah it was
not always like
that it's getting closer to our homes
and it's a big deal for us slowly being
destroyed by this course of climate
change kabas is made up of 33 small
Islands spread across the Pacific in
some areas the ground is 3 m above the
water but almost everywhere else it's
only 1 M rising sea levels are causing
land to disappear the number of storms
is increasing and drinking water is
becoming salty Max's grandfather kirana
has been living here since he was a
child scientists started noting a rapid
rise in sea levels in the
1990s if the water continues to rise it
will erode our land the sea is drawing
closer and closer and will make our
lives unpleasant don't you think what
should we
do maybe this is climate change but what
can we do about it nothing we can't do
anything and we urgently need
help not everyone in kiras thinks the
situation is hopeless Peli alofa is a
climate activist and founder of kiraan a
local climate Protection Organization
she and other campaigners bought this
plot of land when it was completely
flooded together they work to build a
wall and drain the land they want to
show others that they are a resilient
nation and they don't want to
leave this is our resilient Village
we're always
underwat when it's high tight we will
not here water will be right in the main
road residents are braving the encroach
in Sea waterer they're teaching others
how to grow food in constantly salinized
soil pel's nephew Ralph spring is the
gardener here and he knows how
cultivation can work in these
conditions a growing food um uh on
raised beds over the ground if you if
your place is salt salt water in Ed and
um we also make our own soil and that's
a skill that every household should
should uh should know to plant their own
food to be healthy we collect a lot of
our Browns these are chips made from uh
all sorts of we have some leaves inside
that are brown now some some as you can
see some of the sticks from brushes and
all this one will stay at the bottom
because we know this will take time to
decompose and then we'll put good soil
on top that's what we'll use for
planting his services are a vital
contribution in a country where an
increasing number of crops are dying
because of the salt water but Peli and
her colleague Maris Peter know that this
won't fix everything they need more
resources you know kilas our government
wanted to raise Islands here and maybe
we we do not have the means to do that
but there are countries in the world who
have islands and they've built their
Islands because they have the two things
they have the technology and they have
the funds they have money those are the
two things to help us to stop the
problem that we're facing we're not
going to run from the problems we're
going to face it but we do not have
those two
things it's not yet clear exactly how
the main island of teraa will be
elevated the problem is that the island
is densely populated residential
buildings government buildings and
hospitals would need to be demolished
before the island could be raised up and
then rebuilt another possibility is
filling in a kind of replacement Island
the government has remained tight lipped
on these costly ideas and so far nobody
has responded to our requests for an
interview China is one possible donor
because it works closely with kirbas but
the West fears new Chinese military
bases in the Pacific as yet there's no
information on the kirbas government's
plan in this area CLA and tangaroa and
Tera say the same thing they live with
their 10-year-old daughter in a small
house on teraa the main island of kabas
they say information about climate
change is only reaching the other
Islands very slowly despite the visible
changes so because the the term climate
change for our people it's really a new
words but they they can aware they are
aware of the changes that occur in their
Island so by answering that I think uh
it's definitely confusing but our people
are facing the the the severe impact and
yeah I think we experience it in in so
many ways the water already plish of
course we have a a very narrow Island
but why now you know people used to have
good water but why now that we we have a
a salty water right now water is the
biggest problem rising sea level are
pushing salt water further in land
making groundwater unusable importing
bottle drinking water is too expensive
and rain water is the only option for
many people tangaroa says you can no
longer distinguish between the rainy and
dry seasons sometimes it rains all the
time sometimes not for years making the
water supply inconsistent uh because
this one is full yeah and I have to
collect uh extra
water uh that we can use for
for our
needs because we drink green
water Claire and tangaroa also have a
well in their Garden their water isn't
salty because they live in the middle of
the island but that also means they have
a lot of responsibility not only do they
drink from the well their neighbors also
come here to get water that's why
tangaroa cleans it once a month and the
neighbors help
out
just to make sure that our our water
inside this this one is clean every
every day yeah yeah you know when we
start building a house we don't have a
we don't have a water tank we don't have
rain water we use this this well to
drink
water we used to drink this
water and we really need to take care of
this W this
water that's in case no no rain no
rain this is our water yeah this is our
drinking
[Music]
water kirbas is full of solidarity
tangaroa is on his way to see his friend
Tabo araa OA who lives right by the Sea
like the other Coastal residents he's
built a wall in front of his house for
protection it has been standing for 40
years and has made Seaside living
possible on the overcrowded Island but
that's gradually changing when they
built their the wall that time yeah they
don't have a problem with the the sea
the the sea and by that time things
happen to the SE War they start uh the
war the W start uh uh broken during the
the king's
ties I get scared when the king ties
come
especially when it's windy my wall is
always on the verge of
breaking the next morning they survey
the damage from the night before it
wasn't as bad as Tabo had feared but he
still has to repair his wall a stone has
come loose it's only a small repair
needed today but it has to be done
quickly if I don't fix this now the next
flood this afternoon will cause even
more damage stones will break loose and
the land beneath it will just get washed
away it can still be saved however
researchers predict that the rate at
which sea levels are rising will only
accelerate more conservative
calculations predict a rise of 1.1 M
compared to today should that occur
kassa's fate would be uncertain but
judging by the impact that the climate
crisis is already having on this small
country it's reasonable to assume that
land will continue to shrink in the
future and that drinking water will
become even more scarce without
International Aid residents could become
climate refugees if our islands is
disappear uh from this Earth then um we
we will not we will be nothing because
what is important for me is my culture
my
language my my people so I request to
the world that they will be they need to
sacrifice and have compassion on the
lowly islands like talu Marshall Island
mivs and and kipus who already affected
by the climate change
impact the residents are committed but
they need developed countries to invest
money and resources to save kirbas
there's even a song hear about climate
change every child knows the words just
like they know what climate change means
for kirbas tangar roa's niece Cindy
bonato sings it in the
choir
myself searching for my refuge as the
world is getting worse day and
night my people in my future my country
on my
own stand firm and staying strong Until
the End of
Time climate change is growing strong
the rising wave will kill a soul and we
cry yeah we cry to the Lord to help me
through

foreign
cycle of training runs throughout the
year there is the rest face and then
there is a development stage you know
like pre preparation towards the season
and then they will have the
pre-competition
the pre-competition period is now where
you have a structured weekly training
sessions that are done on a daily basis
doing different types of training
the structure of that cycle
is that you have an athlete doing two
sessions of either endurance speed
training or speed training so that is
the general structure of the weekly
session it's a composition of speed
endurance strength training and Recovery
runs
okay
the best way to execute uh training to
achieve that component of speed
endurance and speed is to train on the
track
because you are doing it in a measured
area it's uniform you can also monitor
progress in terms of the times achieved
I think drug training is one way whereby
you can test yourself you can test your
muscles whether they can
that it can
help to be up and down up and down and
and it it tells us
in the next two months three months
[Music]
going up to 15 and 16 kilometers the
whole session
no because you go there with a set
volume let's say this week you're doing
thousands in maybe three minutes and 10
seconds
maybe after two weeks you know when you
go to the same track ideally for a coach
to monitor progress the time should be
moving from 310 which you did you know
some some weeks or two weeks back
should tour around
305 or even closer to three minutes
so besides
achieving the the speed that you are
looking for whether it is speed
endurance or speed it also is a a better
way of managing monitoring the progress
okay guys the 10 position is very
important for an athlete because it's a
fundamental these are fundamentals and
the colors
of lasting long in the spot
because it it builds your mentors mental
strengths
and also it is giving you extra
speed endurance
[Music]
the tempo session the real temp position
is a basic training
which is holding a consistent face
a consistent face can be if you are
doing a 10 kilometer or a 14 kilometer
training
it means that you are going to always
Haul on a constant speed it could be if
you are doing a 255 per kilometer or 250
per kilometer always
the lock that we are having in Uganda is
that when we are having a Tempo session
that we can go down the mountain so we
can do it on 1100 meters altitude so
that means more oxygen it is also the
only place we have in our area that we
can run on a flat Road
and yeah because of Flat Road lower
altitude the boys can and the girls can
run they can develop much more much more
speed
we are not doing it every week so do I
we are doing it about two times in three
weeks so uh it's a very important
session but it is also very tough that's
also one of the reasons reasons that we
are not doing it every week
perfect nice
you really have to be focused with your
mindset because
if you you have to battle
the edge of giving up especially when
you're doing a tough Temple session
sometimes you find that you are your
your brain is telling you that you need
to stop it is too hard so
you it really trains you mentally and if
you go for a race
I know that you will not be able to to
give up easily
[Music]
easy running Communists training that
give us 50 up to 60 percent of The
Athlete's performance
easy run is important for athletes the
main one is to as after hard the
training session or median training
session and or Long training body to get
a recovery
[Music]
for example if today is competition I
can do is running in the evening my my
body becomes to normal
the PS4 is running maybe as me it is
different according to the athlete also
that is different according to the
course area that means high altitude
or up and down or flat area
even in in Ethiopia there are many
[Music]
slow altitude sometimes High attitude
that's why the pace is different
[Music]
fan
it's like going for a gym
if you go to gymnasium you need to go
for more than three months in order to
cut muscles and become fit
s that you need to train for long
and for a longer period so that's
all the trainings and can cover there
and take all the distance
affection
this it needs consistency
that it doesn't need that you are happy
and tomorrow you are down it needs that
you run consistently and at you know
four months six months you will achieve
in a good way
uh what is really important for me is
that it's not so much the performance
is how
somebody moves from point A to point B
you can have an athlete that has
probably certain
ability and that athlete puts 100
percent
effort and achieves
100 percent
potential
to me as a coach that's the best thing
that I when I go home I really feel good
foreign
[Music]

[Music]
[Music]
when i was young growing up looking at
the mirror i didn't love myself
confidence is the key in everything in
life because when you want to achieve
something you can have
all the skills
in the world in order for the magic to
happen you need the confidence in
everything that you do and martial art
taught me confidence
[Music]
sydney
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
what's remarkable about that first
meeting is how unremarkable it was
no one in that room would have looked at
george and said
ten years from now
this man will be considered the greatest
fighter on the planet
a great metaphor for who george st
pierre is as a person a guy who came
from nowhere
through his own study and hard work
took himself from obscurity to
superstardom and from that
delicate beginning
came the career of one of the greatest
fighters of all time
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
[Music]
to be honest
george's first
title fight where he defeated matt
hughes
george was still in a fairly immature
part of his career
physically
and tactically
he was the champion
but mentally he wasn't there yet
take it paul
overhand pull over
for me the most interesting one
is not the first time george won the
title but the second
[Music]
nothing
in my life have been given to me
easily easily easily easily
even when i was a kid one of the best
gift i think that my parents gave me is
to teach me the the value of hard work
george comes from a very grounded family
his his mother and father
did a fantastic job of raising a
strong-willed but still humble child
[Music]
[Music]
i believe my
my first loss
i lost it because of a lack of
confidence
and then
i win the title because after i realize
that everybody is a human being nobody
is invincible
soon after george had won the title
he got injured
and
took
a decision
which was
there's no other way to say it was
unprofessional he took on a challenger
matt sarah who was himself a very
dangerous opponent
in a state of physical injury
and
underestimated the danger
of his
of his opponent
[Music]
and i think that my second loss in my
career i lost it especially because of a
too much confidence
i had a false feeling of security
it makes me realize that no matter how
good you are
and how well you're doing you're always
at one mistake
to lose everything
that revealed very quickly that the
young man who had won the title
wasn't ready to keep the title
there is a world of difference between
winning a title and keeping a title if
you think it's hard to win a title i'll
tell you right now it's ten times harder
to keep
[Music]
i believe it's important to know where
you're from but not to be haunted
by the bad souvenir
the scars show where you come from but
they don't have to dictate where you're
going
[Music]
live
every second in the present
[Music]
you can see in george a natural
curiosity and intellectual curiosity
across many subjects it's not just
martial arts he's fascinated by
everything from
the study of dinosaurs to ancient
history
foreign languages it's
when you see that kind of general
curiosity you know someone will be a
good student
[Music]
after i retired i was diagnosed with
ulcer colitis it's a inflammatory of the
intestine
at the time i it was very bad i was on
severe medication
i've met a doctor jason fong who
introduced me to fasting
so i start to implement fasting into my
my life
then after i
met
paul saladino and he opened my eyes to
a new world
about animal based diet and it had a
very positive effect on my ulcer colitis
three
if you want to make a healthy choice in
your life you have to look at history
how your ancestor when they kill an
animal they go for the the organs
we have different tastes now especially
in the western world but we forgot some
time that the organs are the most
nutritious thing that we can get because
it has a profound effect not only
physically but also on the brain
on our creativity
how sharp we are
i like to learn about the the past where
we come from because i always believe
that life it's a repeating cycle and in
martial art the same thing if you're
fighting someone you look at his past
fight you'll see that he has repetitive
things that he does all the time
[Music]
people
say that after the uh the loss to mass
error george changed his tactics
and became overly conservative it's
actually not true
what he did change was his preparation
for pages
and so he went 180 degrees the other way
into almost overkill with preparation so
that nothing
got left
out of the equation
immediately i wanted to erase my loss i
was angry at myself i wanted
i never wanted
to be real i wanted to erase it but i
couldn't do that you cannot go back in
the past but i was doing the wrong thing
because instead of focusing on what
snacks what's
on the present moment i was always
focusing on i'm gonna beat him next time
i'm gonna get my rematch
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
oh
i met a guy
he's a sport psychologist and he says to
me said george you're not focusing on
the right thing
i said yeah but i want to have my
revenge he's like yeah you will have it
at one point
but
you need to go
and focus on the present right now
because that's what matters
so he made me carry a brick
a very heavy brick
he made me write the name of sarah on it
[Music]
after a few months i couldn't take it
anymore as i i want to get rid of the
brick and he told me are you sure he
said i said yes so he came to montreal
and
we went near the ceiling river and he
told me to grab the brick
and he said now get rid of it so i
grabbed that brick and i threw it in the
snare river
and it makes me feel so good at the time
i had like a relief of
pressure
and it it's a it's a physical gesture
that i did that at profound and pack on
my mental
i i remember it's very hard to explain
but i immediately focused on the present
on my
my upcoming fight i won the fight i
worked my way up add another title shot
after
and i was able to to get to get my
revenge and become world champion again
[Music]
warrior is someone who works really hard
to attain what he wants
he
will face many obstacles
he will hit many walls
but because he's a warrior he's gonna go
through it
and at the end he's gonna succeed
[Music]
i believe that people have a wrong
perception of life i believe that most
of them
believe that human beings that achieve
extraordinary
things were always successful and never
felt
i failed many times but i succeeded at
the end of my career because of those
failure those failure made me
better
you can distinguish between a martial
artist and a fighter okay a fighter gets
ready for the next fight if there's not
a fight coming up he probably won't
train
but a martial artist will train even if
he'll never fight again he sees the
value in what he does is an end in
itself rather than as a means to an end
when i was young growing up
looking at the mirror i didn't love
myself but
i loved who i could become
and even nowadays i'm talking to you i
still not achieve that goal people
believe is i'm only talking about my
career i still have a lot of things that
i'm working on in order to become that
person
the most impressive ones are those who
see their training
and the art that they're
studying as an end in itself
and will continue their study throughout
the duration of a lifetime
rather than for the duration of an
athletic career
i'm much closer now that i was when i
was a kid looking at myself in the
mirror
but i'm still not that idea human being
that i want to become
jesus
inaccessible
just

one of the most controversial things
that I talk about on this channel and
especially on Tick Tock is scripting
your documentary I find it hilarious
because everybody always says the same
exact thing if you're scripting your
documentary then it's not a documentary
it's reality TV but what you're not
understanding is that almost every
single documentary that you see has a
script or at least a treatment now
that's not every single documentary but
the majority of them do that doesn't
mean that you're feeding lines to your
subjects or telling them exactly what to
say however think of your documentary
script like a guy it's supposed to be
there to help you shape your story it's
not a rule that you have to strictly
abide by or to put words into your
character's mouths having a documentary
script believe it or not will help you
save time money and allow you to overall
be more efficient than if you were to
just grab your camera run out your house
and go film something and the only
reason why I know this is because I've
done that I went out and I followed
people for weeks at a time and I got
back to the editing room and I'm like
yeah maybe 20 of this works the rest is
all garbage the rest is useless So today
we're going to talk about how to write
an effective documentary script that
actually helps you tell better stories
and finish your films
before we get into talking about writing
a script there's a few very important
things that you should do first number
one is Define your story in one or two
sentences the truth is if you can't do
this then your story is too complicated
let's take my docu-series along the goat
for example this is a story about a gym
that has become breeding ground for
young and up-and-coming Fighters This
series will follow them on their journey
to become the greatest of all time
simple two sentences that tells you
exactly what this series is about if you
can do that if you can sum up your story
in just one or two sentences then that's
a good indication that you have
something that's digestible and easy to
pitch the second thing that I always
suggest is doing pre-interviews with
your subjects this will allow you to get
to know them and ask them questions
questions about their life and their
journey and what they're trying to
accomplish my advice is to do this with
as many characters in your documentary
as possible that way you get to know
them and their role in the overall Story
Once you have all of this done now
you're ready to start your script
there's literally no way you're going to
be able to predict the outcome of this
documentary but the goal is to give your
best guess as to where you think this
story could go so coming back to my
document series of all the goat I would
start my script by introducing some of
the characters and how their lives are
intertwined with each other for your
documentary maybe it's where the main
character started their Journey or
talking about their childhood or the
Catalyst that got them to embark on this
journey in the first place law the goat
is a dreamer's story this is about
Fighters putting it all on the line and
sacrificing everything to obtain their
dream it's important to think about the
theme of your story what is the main
human emotion that you're trying to
Showcase and think about how you're
going to write that into the First Act
of your film once I have the main
characters established and we've set the
stage for the world that our audience is
going to be in we then need to introduce
the conflict
[Music]
and this could be where your character
faces their biggest adversity for law
the goat this could be an injury or
maybe even one of the fighters losing
and then you start to have your first
problem in your story you might have a
very obvious problem that you introduce
or you might have to create this
illusion for this adversity or
exaggerate my suggestion is to figure
out what your character's problem is or
what you think it could be and how you
think they would respond to this how
would this problem affect them and
remember we're writing a script based on
what we think and how we perceive the
situation is going to be and pan out but
the truth is is that all of this has to
be subject to change because they might
not react the way you think they might
encounter an entirely different problem
than what you're writing and that's okay
you just have to remember that these are
the basic ideas that are going to take
you through the different steps of this
journey so try to remember that you have
to be flexible
[Music]
now that we've introduced the conflict
it's time for our character to start
taking action how are they fighting back
you need to highlight the showdown
between your main character and their
enemy or the emotion or whatever problem
this whole thing has been leading up to
they need to be able to go Toe to Toe
and have this battle that's what you
need to Showcase in this third Act is it
a competition that's been something that
we've been building up for or are they
on the precipice of catching the
criminal in your true crime documentary
whatever it is that your character is up
against they eventually have to go
toe-to-toe and that needs to be written
in your script and again it might change
it might be something that you think is
gonna happen and it might be something
completely different but at least you
know the story beats and how it's going
to get there
final thing that you script is the
outcome of this battle and just as I
said before you take your best guess of
what you think is gonna happen and you
play it out in your head now let's just
say for example one of the fighters that
I'm documenting I have in the ending
that he wins but he actually loses
well you have two options number one you
flip the script and you still interview
all the same people and instead of it
being a happy ending it's more of an
ending that's real and maybe left on a
sad note or that could be the big
adversity that you've been waiting for
that you could actually follow up with
and that's something that I've actually
gone through and a great example of how
you can be flexible in your storytelling
and in your script writing and remember
that everything that you're scripting
everything that you're writing down
could still be used you just have to
frame it differently you have to be
moldable and shapeable and flexible to
tell this story what I like to do with
the ending is come full circle with the
theme of the story what is that
Universal human emotion that you nod to
in the end for me and law the goat a
fighter winning or losing doesn't affect
the fact that this is a dreamer story
and sometimes dreams don't come true and
if it does then it's a beautiful story
but if it doesn't it's still a great
story worth telling so try to ask
yourself what is the emotion that you're
trying to Showcase last week I put out a
poll trying to figure out the kind of
content that you guys are struggling
with and by far the most requested
content was storytelling and honestly I
was pleasantly surprised because I
really didn't think that this was
something that you guys are interested
in and I'm glad because this is by far
the most important aspect of filmmaking
is figuring out how to tell good
Universal stories and I'm totally aware
that this video might not get a ton of
views and I'm fully aware that script
writing and writing in general could be
boring for your average filmmaker but it
is a very important aspect of filmmaking
and one that needs to be paid attention
to I also asked you guys last week and
I'm going to continue to ask you guys
through the weeks ahead on my
documentary videos what would you guys
like to learn in a documentary course
more than anything I want to know from
you guys what are the things that you
need to be able to tell better stories
and finish your doc Americans and you
know a lot of you guys on that pull put
storytelling and I'm I'm very glad about
that but if you guys can drop in the
comments down below specific things that
you would like in this documentary
course I really want to know and I
really want to add that and Implement
that into this course and give you guys
something of value that actually works
specifically for you so I'd like to
thank you guys for watching this video
don't forget to like And subscribe to
the channel if you haven't already and
I'll catch you guys in the next one

school violence erupted again today
suddenly and with a vengeance columbine
high in littleton colorado
it has been a horror in 1999
two high school students went on a
deadly rampage
and the images seared themselves into
the nation's collective memory
one of the worst school shootings ever
15 dead bodies
still being identified an american
nightmare that too many schools know too
well
yet how much of our explanation for that
nightmare was right
the entire country was confident that
these two killers were two
loner outcasts from the trench coat
mafia
who were targeting jocks in a revenge
fantasy
none of that was true misguided
perceptions of the columbine shooting
continue to influence us today
1999 two students culminated
months of planning by donning black
trench coats and attacking their school
armed with guns and an arsenal of
homemade bombs
they terrorized teachers and peers they
had
a couple of duffel bags at their feet
and we witnessed them pulling out what
we assumed to be paintball guns
that later on turned out to be something
completely different
my secretary comes in and
yells that there had been a report of
gunfire and bombs exploding
so i ran out of my office saw a gunman
coming towards me
i remember hearing gunfire
and i remember glass breaking behind me
i was laying in broken glass from the
the window that had gotten shot out
all i could hear was the the fire alarms
going off
um and then the gunshots at a distance
okay has anybody been injured
okay and the school is in a panic and
i'm in the library i've got
stunned down another table tip heads
under the table
we were all crouched under the tables
and we could hear the
um the the gunshots um getting louder
and
a couple times there was a big boom and
the floor would shake
oh god the gun is right outside the
library
they came into the library eric leaned
under the table and pointed his gun
at me i mean i was like trembling under
there like a little leaf
i saw the shotgun stared at the shotgun
and
all i remember is seemed like the barrel
of the gun was the size of a cannon as
soon as that bullet entered my backpack
and
actually paralyzed me shattering my
vertebrae
that's when the pain set in so there was
like eric um
on my right and then dylan was up on my
left
and i looked up at dylan and i said hey
dylan and he said hey man
and i said what are you doing and
it still like chills me how he was just
like
killing people the killers fatally shot
12 students and a teacher in less than
20 minutes
then they turned the guns on themselves
12 kids died on my watch
along with the teacher in our lives
you're not supposed to bury your kids
and they were all my kids
before the world had fully grasped what
had happened inside the school
there was a scramble to make sense of it
we're getting coverage from four
stations in the denver area
of a shooting at a high school a still
developing situation and one that looks
like it's not going to be over
anytime soon horrors like columbine
terrify us
and we need an explanation so even if we
don't have
an answer we find one and we find it
really too fast
two witnesses that we talked to on the
telephone describe them as members of
the trench coat mafia
these are kids they claim routinely
dress and blatch trench coats
kids were watching this on tv
and also it was the early days of cell
phones if they weren't seeing it their
friends were watching on tv calling them
on their cell phones
um and letting them know they were
saying that um that they wanted to do
this for their revenge
for the school i guess because i mean
they're such an outcast at our school
was this little round and round feedback
chamber so when a kid goes on tv and
says oh yeah they were outcasts
another kid who doesn't really know the
killers well or at all
thinks oh oh they're outcasts oh i
didn't realize that then when he's
interviewed he says they're outcasts so
you're you know you're contaminating the
witness pool
like that and speculation about a
black-coated mafia and its supposed
grievances ran wild
a gang that apparently hated athletes it
was all because
people were mean to him last year the
trench coat mafia
is more than just black clothes these
boys were dangerously strange
in a yearbook photo of some group
members that was broadcast nationwide
neither gunman appeared one member of
the trenchcoat mafia
john savage said there was a good reason
for their absence
eric and dylan were not not at all a
part of
the things that we did as a group they
didn't hang out with us
they weren't trench coat mafia at all
and he says the media's description of
him and his friends
had little basis in fact the trench coat
mafia was like we were
we were video game nerds we weren't we
like you know sit around the table and
you know play dungeons and dragons you
know which is just about
the least dangerous thing you could do
it was a
group of friends that had similar
interests some kids referred to him as
the trench coat mafia but it was not
that it was an organized club
but the explanation about outcast loners
seeking revenge against bullies
had the dual advantage of being both
dramatic and familiar
what happened here at littleton is a
grotesque distortion of high school
fears and rivalries involving cliques
the in groups and out groups
that are a part of teen life in america
author dave cullen spent nearly 10 years
on his account of columbine
researching police records the killer's
diaries and their lives at the school
he said the boys had busy social lives
and didn't seem motivated by bullying
there was lots of bullying at columbine
it was a high school in america
did it have anything to do with driving
these two boys to murder
i cannot find any evidence of that the
killers directed their hostility toward
the whole student population
placing propane bombs set to go off in
the cafeteria at lunchtime
but the devices failed to detonate as
planned columbine actually wasn't a
successful shooting
it was a failed bombing how much more
indiscriminate can you get two big bombs
to kill everyone who happens to be in
that part of the building at the start
of a launch
cullen describes the killer's motives as
a cocktail of malice self-loathing
and a craving for fame over time they
became something like a two-man cult
bent on making their mark on the world
in one final act
it was a murder-suicide for both of them
for eric it was primarily a murder
for dylan it was primarily suicide they
took the tactics of terrorists
and said we can do the same stuff for
our own aggrandizement
eric talked about his audience in his
journal and whether they were going to
understand this
and there was one message observers seem
to take from the event immediately
school shootings have become a dark
stain on american life the phenomenon of
kids turning guns on their schoolmates
is all too familiar
it's not just littleton we know that now
we've had lots and lots and lots of
places
columbine came after a string of school
shootings in oregon
arkansas and other states reaction to
the colorado massacre
helped fuel a national movement towards
school security
parents across the country are demanding
to know what their schools are doing to
keep
their children safe today nearly half of
public schools surveyed nationwide
employ police or hired guards at least
21 states mandate lockdown drills for
school shooting scenarios
and millions of dollars have been spent
on everything from metal detectors
to anti-bullying programs
when people hear as somebody was caught
planting a columbine the world knows
what that means
more than a decade after columbine we're
still struggling to figure out not only
what causes school shootings
but whether or not we're seeing more of
them and coverage of the issue
offers little clarity school shootings
are on the rise in america
i'm telling you i have the numbers to
show it but there's actually very little
consensus on those numbers
experts say that the number is
statistically unchanged since the 1990s
the number of school shootings in
america has been rapidly in decline
over the last decade researchers can't
agree on a methodology for tallying up
attacks
they make different decisions about
whether to include non-fatal attacks on
schools or foiled ones
or even on-campus suicides or gun
accidents
and this leads to vastly different final
numbers
we unfortunately tend to judge how
frequently events occur by how often we
hear about them and that
of course depends on on news reports of
these things happening
the death toll rises in an attack inside
the school cafeteria
in los angeles two students were wounded
in an
accidental shooting a school shooting in
texas leaves two
students injured one statistic with a
more clear-cut definition
is overall homicides in schools the
center for disease control regularly
tracks those numbers
and the trend line is clear while they
vary from year to year
school homicides are essentially flat
across the decades
they're also extremely rare there are
over 300
shootings every day in the united states
how many of those occur in schools
almost none of them
and rare as they are when school
shootings do
happen there's some evidence that past
attacks
and intense media focus on the killers
have helped inspire
future ones that he was inspired by the
columbine killers attack
eight years ago today the gunman adam
lanza was obsessed with the 1999
columbine high school attack and some
news outlets are beginning to take
notice
we are not during this broadcast using
the name of the shooter
often it seems that in history remembers
the names of murderers and not the names
of
victims
it's good that school shootings are
still shocking because it shows that
they're
they're really rare so i think it's
important to
to kind of keep in mind that there are a
lot of schools all over the world
where no one's ever been shot
i could spend my entire life living in
fear wondering
when's the next attack or when's the
next person gonna do that but
that would be it i'd be living in fear i
would be giving in to
what they wanted to happen
you

[Music]
At the start, it was all different.
No, this isn't your white picket fence American Dream start,
I mean the kid was popping pills for 
Christ's sake.
Yeah you think that sounds wild?
Wait until you hear this next part:
He didn't even need them.
That's right, his mom was what you call a hypochondriac
and self-diagnosing Champion.
A true medical infomercial evangelist.
Today three out of four doctors recommend
the ingredients in Anderson for headache pain.
She decided Kyle will be better off getting started on medication early.
For his health of course.
In reality,
it helped Kyle put on weight.
Growing up lower middle class,
his family lived paycheck to paycheck.
With hand-down clothes from his father,
and the daily medication routine,
Kyle was different.
It separated him from the kids 
at school.
Luckily his father was a hotel manager in Miami,
so when the hotel switched owners,
the entire family relocated to Dallas, Texas.
Thrown into a new environment,
the kid was desperate to change.
[Music] 
and [ __ ] did.
Kyle flipped the script,
he loved the waters.
In Dallas, he developed a passion for diving.
[Music]
His Relentless work ethic for 
diving,
later became the backbone of his trading.
He worked so hard, he even 
got a scholarship.
[Applause]
Besides diving,
College was boring.
Chemistry Labs,
molecules,
anatomy,
yaaaaawn.
It's putting me to sleep already.
But that's where his life was heading,
and he hated it.
Every chance he got, Kyle hit 
the waters to get his mind off things.
In his junior year at Uni, he faced the 
choice.
Picking an elective.
Knowing he couldn't take another life-draining class,
instead, he wanted something more exciting.
In his search, he came across a class titled "Options and Futures".
Deep down money has always sparked his curiosity. 
Ever since his childhood and his deep-rooted anxiety towards it,
he wanted to learn more.
So he took a chance,
and like an elk-steak fresh off the grill,
his juicy taste consumed him.
Up till now, his relationship with 
money had been one of fear and ignorance.
Even though his class covered a lot of the basics,
Bonds,
Stocks,
Options,
to Kyle,
it was the Book of Revelations.
The key to escaping living life 
paycheck to paycheck.
After the first class, Kyle took the class book back to his dorm.
In a week, he had finished the whole book. 
Despite his pre-med basis,
Kyle finished top of the class,
and it ignited his Fame.
He wanted to switch major.
[Music]
Fearing his parents' reactions,
he debated his choice.
Could he do it?
What if he didn't do it?
Would he spend the rest of his life bored out of his mind and unhappy as a doctor?
Nah, he didn't want that, so for the first time in his life,
the kid followed his gut.
He switched his major to finance with a focus on Real Estate.
Real Estate had always been historically somewhat safe.
Right after, he went crazy.
Kyle had become obsessed.
He was so intrigued with mastering the concept of money,
every day after class he walked off campus reading any Finance book he could get his hands on.
Plus, we're talking any Vincent Norman Peel on Tony Robbins book out at a time, and  
Tony Robbins wrote a lot.
I did.
In exchange for his college parties and endless diving,
at a slow pace,
he became comfortable with Finance.
Naturally, the kid graduated with a degree in Finance,
and undergrad in Real Estate.
He walked away with a solid understanding of finance,
and a feeling of direction.
From a spark flame, it grew into 
a burning desire.
His curiosity for compounding interest,
molded into resolve.
He knew he wanted to achieve Financial Freedom
by mastering Finance.
To become a grand master in finance,
he knew he would have to play in the big leagues.
There was only one place to go, that's wild enough to satisfy those desires:
Wall Street.
 [Music]
In the early 1990s, Wall Street was not a place you walk into.
You were born into it.
Yeah, business was booming, there was plenty of positions,
but it was a dog-eat-dog environment.
Competitive firms were doing whatever they could
to get an edge.
And only hiring the best of the best,
was part of it.
And best not as in skill,
but 'best' as in fanciest credentials.
You know, the Princeton,
Harvard,
Stanford type of credentials,
Places where you couldn't get in unless you had a wealthy family
or a senior-position Uncle
who will get you that spot.
It was Cutthroat.
But Kyle had already overcome his first obstacle,
his mindset.
I mean he was still permanently spinning pens
and tapping his feet in every conversation,
but hey,
mentally, he now had direction.
He wanted to get into Wall Street.
He wanted to prove himself 
and achieve true Financial Freedom.
No matter what the cost.
Educated on money,
Kyle is now thinking like the wealthy,
aiming to minimize the time he traded for money.
Plus, he had picked up the habit 
of reading books
from which he learned the power of positive thinking
and grit.
His credentials 
were probably as worthy as a Dogecoin.
Yet he refused to compromise.
There's nothing to go back 
to.
Kyle made a simple decision.
He was going to interview with every single Wall Street firm
until one of them, let him in.
Kyle wrote countless letters,
sacrificing any last bit of pride 
he had,
he knocked on all their doors.
But it got him interviews.
Some of these interviews were retail brokerages.
After his third interview with the retail brokerage firm 'Prudential Securities',
the interviewer asked him:
'Listen Kyle,
I'm gonna be honest with you.
We normally only hire experienced professionals.
People who are moving to their second career.
We've never hired someone straight out of college,
so why should I hire you?'
Or translate it transparently,
Why hire a kid with limited economic understanding and no wealthy connections?
To which Kyle responded:
'Because if you don't,
you'll be sorry.'
[Music]
But the high was quick to pass,
this was Wall Street.
And as a lot of rookies on Wall Street,
it was straight to the trenches.
For a year and a half, Kyle got his start at Prudential Securities,
where he went through all their global trading programs.
With minimal 
pay in crazy overtime hours,
it's mentally tough.
His superiors towards guts out.
He had no personal life.
But going through that program, Kyle learned a lot.
All the different hierarchies of thought 
and specializations of the big firms.
The Prodigy finished top of class at Prudential.
Within no time you got to offer for Bear Stearns.
With the $2500 he had earned, he bought his first ticket 
to Geneva
to explore a new industry:
Hedge funds.
[Music]
While it's nothing new to you Traders now, 
at the time it was revolutionary.
Like crypto nowadays,
in the 90s,
hedge funds was the new 
booming game.
Kyle wanted in.
But he was still a rookie.
His new role at Bear Stearns was simple:
Make the big shots look good.
He started out as a research analyst.
He researched potential interesting company stocks and presented his findings.
The big shots he pitched his ideas 
to were a group of short sellers.
Inspired by their work,
Kyle competed against fellow rookies 
and tried to work hard to impress the big shots.
Working long hours and often pulling nighters,
Kyle was hungry.
His focus in life was identifying overvalued or fraudulent stocks.
He researched 
everything from
East Germany shipyards
to Texas mortgage lenders.
Kyle's macro-analysis skills were growing.
His research tips were solid
but it wasn't enough.
If you wanted to get ahead and move 
up the ranks,
you needed an edge.
Something all the big shots that the firm would turn to you for.
An edge that no one else developed.
After years of grinding his way up at Bear Stearns,
Kyle developed his edge.
He developed the talent for sniffing out corrupt [ bullsh__ ],
and wasn't afraid to let anyone 
know.
Short Selling based on macro-analysis.
See, Kyle was smart.
He realized that most traders were limiting themselves by focusing only on the U.S markets.
Kyle wanted to keep the freedom of 
looking at a global scale.
Even though he often made micro-scale trades,
shorting overvalued U.S company stocks was still the name of the game.
But with this macro perspective,
he could also take Global-driving event trades.
This liberty allowed him to concentrate 
only on trades with the largest upside.
His edge was unique,
and every big shot at the 
firm,
wanted a piece of it.
At the age of 28, Kyle became senior managing director.
One of the youngest in Bear Stearns' history.
His tireless dedication had paid off,
but not without paying a hefty price.
He had sacrificed his youth to the firm.
Despite being behind the analysis of some of the greatest trades,
he was still answering to the big shots.
While he did all the work,
he 
still relied on the so-called experts to make the final judgment call.
They were the decision-makers.
From shaping his mindset in college
to crafting his skills and forming a 
unique edge over the years,
Kyle had grown.
But in order to satisfy his grand ambition
and truly achieve freedom,
he decided there was one final step to take.
Risking everything he had built over the years at Bear Stearns,
Kyle decided to start his own firm.
He launched his firm Hayman Capital Management LP
with 5 million of his own money and 28 million from investors.
The pressure and constant feeling 
of anxiety
reached new Highs.
But he knew, it was his only shot at achieving his grand ambition.
But starting your own firm is not exactly a walk in the park.
It's like chewing on a piece of glass 
and staring into the abyss.
Not exactly a fun experience,
unless you're into that of course.
To build a hedge fund, you need reputation.
Since your sole purpose is to manage other people's money,
you need to figure out how to get the wealthiest eyeballs
on you
and well, Kyle had Jack [ s__ ].
Other hedge funds managers have reputations from their iconic trades
and historic performances.
Kyle wasn't known for anything.
To make matters worse,
he was now responsible for the livelihood of other people.
Kyle is good-natured,
he hated firing people.
Trying to figure things out he was burning through 
his fund's War chest.
A lot of it is on money.
With average performance,
some of the investors started to express their doubts.
Kyle had gone from the golf court,
back of trenches.
He needed a home run play quick.
He felt the pressure tightening around his neck,
[Music]
While at a wedding in Spain, Kyle was taking the 
edge off with some fine wine.
Finally catching a breather.
He struck up a passing conversation 
with the NYC investment banker,
who brought up an interesting topic:
Synthetic CDOs.
That's right.
A Bubble Boy.
For those of you that watched The Big Short,
it was the key to the 2007 housing market crash.
Aka
the synthetic CDO
was the atomic bomb with a drunk president
holding his finger over the button
Kyle couldn't believe it.
Confused with the depth 
of dog [ s__ ] behind the conversation,
he knew he had to learn more.
So at the hotel after, this dude 
gave him a number to a CDO manager.
At the end of the day, he took the call with the manager
who proceeded to explain to him,
the true complexities of dog [ s__ ] CDOs.
While he learned a lot from the call,
Kyle felt more anxious and disturbed than ever.
If he was right, it would bring down 
the entire economy and destroy millions of lives.
Chilled to the bone, all his trained corruption 
and fraud-detecting instincts pointed him  
towards a massive opportunity.
He smelt the dog [ s__ ] miles away
He had to figure this thing out,
so he set his eyes on a California shop called 'Quick Loan Funding',
small place started by a guy named 
Daniel Cedric, ex-car salesman.
But the dude was printing money.
Even funded a 35 million-dollar film for his fiancee actress.
His firm hired private investigators to test 
how hard it would be to get a mortgage.
Within no time, investigators all secured mortgages 
with no income verification,
or down payment.
Based on additional internal research,
this was the biggest case in American history.
He knew he had hit gold.
The kind of trade that would get him his reputation.
But no one believed him.
Every investor he pitched, said he was crazy.
He pitched hundreds of investors in an attempt to get more capital.
With minimal success,
it looked hopeless.
No one cared.
The pressure from 
running his own firm was building up.
Burning through his cash,
losing even more investors' faith,
he had nowhere left to turn.
This call will make or break him.
Potentially losing everything, 
and utter humiliation in the industry.
His back was against the wall. 
With all the experienced investors 
telling him he was wrong,
it was hard to swallow.
When everyone tells you you're crazy,
you're the one that's insane.
The fear
was paralyzing.
[Music]
One night, working overtime in 
the office, he started daydreaming.
Reminiscing on how far he came.
His childhood,
the medication,
deciding to become a doctor,
the courage of changing his path,
and the years dedicated to 
proving to others that he was great.
His constant fear of feeling 
inadequate.
It had always driven him.
And then it hit him.
Nothing had changed.
It was the so-called medical experts all over again.
Everyone always knows better.
Regurgitating theory from the college medical books, or
rephrasing Morgage Stanley research reports 
in their fancy Brioni suits,
They all had the answers.
But how many of them, actually do the work?
He knew he did,
and he knew the corruption he found.
And so Kyle, made the call.
Despite the high stakes,
he would rather go out betting on himself,
than to continue through the fear of others.
Kyle decided
he would have faith in his own work.
[Music}
Reignited by his youthful flame, 
Kyle set out to short the housing market.
He switched up his approach.
Instead of pitching investors the opportunity,
he pitched them the low risk to reward.
His new approach was more risk-averse.
To reassure investors, 
he shorted the time frame.
Instead of going in early and maximizing profits,
instead, he would wait,
and let the key indicators fall first.
And then go in.
Fewer profits, but more investors.
And it was the right call.
With more investors on board, Hayman Capital 
took all hands on deck to prepare their biggest bet.
There was no going back. Kyle went all in.
If they failed, his firm Heyman would be over.
[Music]
It's August 26th, the head Trader at Heyman 
Capital charged us towards Kyle's office.
The KPIs they tracked on the mortgages 
have fallen below their set entry point.
Unnoticed to most, the falling 
dominoes had hit a point of no return.
Kyle's team began purchasing CDSs,
as a bet against the multi-trillion dollar subprime mortgage market.
This was it.
What followed was months of suspense and disbelief
that their positions weren't 
marked down the way they should.
The costs,
millions in premiums.
But unlike Michael Burry, 
he had started his trade way later.
As in early 2007, his bets started playing 
out.
Profits started rolling in.
Fear had started spreading as subprime 
mortgage lenders started going bankrupt.
Instead of enjoying the wins, Kyle managed 
to get more investors to tag along in his trade,
doubling down on his play.
The next few months were 
the most stressful period of his life.
If the fraudsters figured out a way to keep up with the facade,
Kyle's wins would revert back to 
the premiums,
and he could once again
lose it all.
[Music]
It was the perfect trade.
When it was all said and done, Hayman Capital made close to 4 billion for its investors of the trade,
Kyle used the leveraged power of derivatives to 
short-sell about 4 billion of Subprime Securities
to synthetic CDO Market.
In the following months,
news spread of Kyle's legendary trade.
He had earned a reputation,
so much so that Kyle testified as an expert 
witness before the U.S. House of Representatives,
and the financial crisis inquiry Commission.
With Hayman Capital's success, and 
making millions for himself in the process,
Kyle felt he'd become a master of his own fate.
While the legendary short 
saved his firm and made him crazy rich,
Kyle was still looking ahead.
Driven by his constant fear of inadequacy,
and the pleasure of proving people wrong,
[I constantly feel inadequate,]
[which maybe is what drives me,]
Kyle has his eyes set on becoming an A-Plus firm.
For the past few years,
Kyle has been focusing his research on what he believes is the next big opportunity for the coming decade:
China
[Evergrant on the brink of collapse]
and Japan
[it will be further depreciated,]
[or because, it can be overshooting,]
[it can be coming back]
What does your own research 
work tell you?
Is he right?

[Music]
planet Mars is visible in the sky with
the naked eye as a bright orange scar
thus the planet was known since
antiquity
due to its color the planet was named
after Mars the God of War
the observations of the strange paths of
Mars among the stars made by the Danish
astronomer Tycho Brahe's led Kepler to
discover the laws of planetary motion
[Music]
with the telescope some bright and dark
marks can be observed on its surface by
the end of the 19th century the
astronomers Schiaparelli and Lowell made
visual observations of many straight
lines on its surface these lines were
named channels they believed that there
was once an advanced civilization living
on Mars that had struggled to survive by
transporting water from the planet ice
caps to the arid equatorial area through
these channels the first astronomer to
dispute these beliefs was Eugene
antoniadis
by observing the 1909 apparition of the
planet with the then enormous Madonn
great refractor Antonia proved that the
channels were an illusion and under
perfect seeing conditions they were
fractured geological formation
[Music]
you
[Music]
after the Second World War
telescopic observations provided much
information about the atmosphere and the
morphology of the surface of Mars
[Music]
the real exploration of the planet begun
in the 1970s with the use of unmanned
spacecraft since then numerous missions
have revealed many details of Mars
we have also managed to land
remote-controlled small vehicles
equipped with special instruments to
study the soil of the planet and search
for elementary forms of life
[Music]
unfortunately these searches show no
evidence of life until now it seems that
the planet is dead but the search
continues
[Music]
we now know that Mars orbits the Sun at
the mean distance of 228 million
kilometers we also know that the planet
rotates around its tilted axis in 24
hours and 37 minutes its diameter is six
thousand seven hundred and ninety-four
kilometres and its mass only one tenth
of Earth this small mass is the reason
that the Red Planet cannot retain a
significant atmosphere
today Mars is an arid and inhospitable
place with a mean temperature of about
minus 23 degrees centigrade yet in the
hemisphere that is illuminated by the
Sun the temperatures can rise to 35
degrees centigrade its thin atmosphere
has strong winds and dust storms and
consists mostly of carbon dioxide and
nitrogen with only traces of oxygen at
the poles huge amounts of ice can be
observed the polar ice changes in
appearance along with the seasons of the
planet most of this ice is frozen carbon
dioxide but it seems that there is also
some water ice
on its surface many mountains valleys
Highlands deserts and empty riverbeds
were observed
[Music]
[Applause]
in the past the planet had water in huge
quantities this water either escapes
from the planets of space or was trapped
in reservoirs inside the planets crust
there are also numerous small and big
craters and some huge inactive volcanoes
the biggest volcano on Mars is Mount
Olympus and is 25 kilometres high its
base covers 600 kilometers this volcano
is the biggest in the solar system
[Music]
the large cannon Valles Marineris has a
length of four thousand kilometers and a
depth of up to seven kilometers the
length of Valles Marineris is equivalent
to the length of Europe and extend
across one-fifth the circumference of
Mars
right
[Music]
in 1877 two tiny irregular-shaped
satellites were discovered orbiting the
planet
[Music]
the largest satellite named bubbles is
27 by 22 by 18 kilometers and the
smaller demos only 15 by 12 by 10
kilometers
these objects were probably asteroid
captured by Mars gravitational field and
thus became its satellites
in the near future we could build
scientific colonies on the planet in
order to explore and reveal all the red
planet's secrets we have already
designed instruments and vehicles to be
used by astronauts in future exploration
[Music]
it seems that the time is growing near
when human will step for the first time
on the surface of another planet of our
solar system

[Music]
and welcome back to the fluctus channel
from the earliest days of Commerce
companies and individuals alike needed a
way to transport goods from one place to
another
[Music]
ships were the best option back then
just as they are today
these large boats could carry thousands
of pounds of products move relatively
swiftly and travel to Ports worldwide
over time these smaller vessels evolved
into today's container ships
which can carry tens of thousands of
containers and loads of Advanced
Equipment
[Music]
in the 1700s and 1800s galleons and
other wooden sailing ships were the
primary methods of moving cargo from
place to place
all right
unfortunately the cargo was loaded and
unloaded by hand which was labor
intensive and time-consuming
different ships were also designed to
carry different cargo types making
loading and unloading inefficient
[Music]
also complicating matters were the poor
conditions aboard these older ships
rotted wood and bad storage practices
could quickly spoil shipments of food
and other organic materials before they
get to their destination
fortunately in the 1950s a trucking
entrepreneur named Malcolm McLean
devised an idea to standardized
containers
these new self-contained steel boxes
could be easily loaded onto a truck
train or ship while the ships could get
the most out of each Journey
[Music]
McLean's company Sealand service soon
launched the first container ship the SS
ideal X
the ideal X was 524 feet long and could
carry 58 33 foot containers at once
containerization quickly gained
popularity due to its efficiency and
cost effectiveness
by the 1970s most of the cargo was being
shipped in containers
[Music]
container ships became more extensive
and specialized and special container
Terminals and cranes were installed at
ports to better accommodate them
[Music]
among the largest ever constructed is
the oocl Hong Kong which is
1311 feet long
[Music]
and can carry 21
413 20-foot equivalent containers
[Music]
and the Evergreen everlot which is 1 312
feet long and has a teu capacity of 24
0004.
the latter ship is owned by Evergreen
Marine a Taiwanese shipping giant with
more than 150 cargo vessels in its Fleet
of these nine are in the same class as
the ever a lot Class A
despite their immense size the Evergreen
Class A vessels are typically crewed by
just 20 to 25 people consisting of a
captain officers engineers and other
workers
life on board an egg container ship can
be both challenging and rewarding
the crew Works long hours often spending
several months at Sea before returning
home
to make them comfortable the
shipbuilders installed a variety of
amenities
these include well-appointed Lounge
areas
Lively crew quarters
as well as gyms and Recreation rooms
where the crew can relax and unwind
during their off hours
another well-known company in the global
shipping industry is mayorsk based out
of Denmark
[Music]
E-class vessels have similar Dimensions
to the Evergreen class A's but have
slightly less carrying capacity
[Music]
the work schedule on these 1 300 foot
ships typically follows a rotating shift
pattern where crew members work in
shifts of four to six hours for a period
of several months
nearly all the onboard space is
dedicated to the storage containers
so most of the crew is located in the
tower which stores the bridge and crew
quarters
engine room is located at the stern of
the ship on the lower decks
those working on the deck are typically
charged with checking the lashings and
inspecting the cargo containers
regularly
oh
there is also a mess and Kitchen on
board where crew members can enjoy their
daily meals
and facilities for properly disposing of
food and other waste
constructing a vessel of this size and
weight is done in sections each of which
is fabricated indoors
the bulk of the assembly is accomplished
inside a dry dock using specialized
heavy lifting cranes
as each section is moved into place they
will be welded together to form a
complete hole
[Music]
though the deck of a container ship may
appear flat it is actually made up of
multiple cargo Chambers hundreds of feet
deep
these are where most of the cargo
containers are stored during transport
though several thousand will also sit
above the deckline
once the hole of the ship is complete
the tower and crew quarters will be
added
next the ship's equipment is installed
this includes the engines
propellers Rudder steering gear and
other mechanical and electrical systems
the final stage is the installation of
the crew quarters and other interior
furnishings
[Music]
from design to completion the average
large-scale container ship will cost
tens or hundreds of millions of dollars
[Music]
to ensure they operate as intended
companies like Maersk will put each new
vessel through a battery of tests known
as sea trials
during this process the ship is put
through a series of tests and drills to
ensure it is seaworthy and ready for
service
over several weeks the crew and
Engineers will examine the ship's
propulsion systems
steering systems navigation equipment
and safety features
the ship's engines will be tested at
various speeds and under different loads
to ensure they operate correctly
foreign
systems will be tested to ensure the
ship can maneuver safely in all
conditions
once the sea trials are complete and
necessary adjustments have been made the
ship will be officially delivered to the
buyer and can begin its service
[Music]
all around the world hundreds of
billions of dollars worth of Port
infrastructure have been installed to
allow container ships to do their jobs
[Music]
these include massive heavy lifting
cranes and Acres of Port facilities
where the offloaded containers can be
stored cataloged and taken to their
final destination usually by train or
truck
[Music]
one of the largest and deepest container
terminals in the world is Minami hanmoku
in Yokohama Japan
thank you
the terminal is situated on a man-made
Island in Tokyo bay and covers an area
of approximately 127 hectares
it has a total Quay length of 2500
meters and is equipped with 12 births
Each of which can accommodate even the
largest container ships
the terminal is exceptionally Advanced
and equipped with state-of-the-art
container handling Solutions
these include automated stacking cranes
automated guided vehicles
and a computerized management system
this allows for quick and efficient
loading and unloading of containers
helping to minimize turnaround times for
ships
automated or not the container loading
process is crucial to the success of any
shipment
this is accomplished using a variety of
Machinery particularly cranes
these move the containers into place
while workers on the ship lock them into
place
all containers have locking mechanisms
at the corners so the burst is attached
to the hole and each subsequent
container in the stack is attached to
the one underneath it
once each stack is complete it will be
further secured with lashing equipment
such as chains cables and turnbuckles
[Music]
the crew also checks the weight and
distribution of the containers
throughout the process to ensure that
the ship is properly balanced
upon arrival at the destination Port the
ship is positioned at the dock and the
cranes begin unloading the containers
[Music]
the crane operator uses twist locks to
release the container from the ship's
deck individually
[Music]
this requires a lot of care and
organization not to damage the rest of
the stack
[Music]
depending on the container's Final
Destination it may be put onto a truck
for immediate storage or loaded into a
freight semi for delivery
in many cases ports like these will be
constructed near Railway stations
allowing the cranes to place the
containers directly onto flatbed cars
for immediate shipment
[Music]
the fact that the largest ships can
carry more than twenty thousand
containers this process can take up to
three days

18:45 in North America looks like this
it was divided between the United States
the Republic of Mexico the British
Empire and finally the Republic of Texas
in 1846 after a decade of indecision the
United States annexed Texas which upset
the Mexicans this was because Texas had
itself seceded from Mexico and the two
also claimed the same land which now
meant that the claims of Texas were the
claims of the USA President James K Polk
sent troops to the disputed Mexican US
border and as he had hoped fighting
broke out which meant war Mexico
surrendered after the u.s. occupied its
capital Mexico City in the subsequent
1848 peace treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo
Mexico ceded all of this territory in
the same year the United States and
Britain came to an agreement over the
disputed northern territories and
settled on this so within only four
years the United States had grown from
this to this and it was spurred on by
the idea of manifest destiny this was
the argument that the United States was
willed by God and destined to spread
westward and control all of this
territory before making it fundamentally
American all of this new territory was
not necessarily a good thing though so
America at this point was economically
socially and politically divided North
versus South urban versus rural slave
state versus free state and federal
versus state government the North was
much more urbanized industrialized and
for the most part had outlawed the
practice of slavery many in the North
sources of barbaric practice a sentiment
reinforced by its high rate of European
migration whom for the most part came
from nations which had already outlawed
its practice the South was much more
rural with a greater focus on labor
intensive agriculture which meant that
slavery was economically valuable and
had to become a fact of life there those
who held slaves there also believed that
slavery was simply the natural order of
things
the reason that the US had previously
hesitated on the annexation of Texas was
due to these internal tensions over
slavery in the US Senate each state held
the same number of senators and within
the Senate there was a balance between
the states which allowed slavery in
those which had abolished it Texas was a
slave state and so the balance was upset
which led to fist debates over what
should happen with the new territories
and how they can be used to address this
imbalance there were many in the u.s.
who were fiercely opposed to slavery and
thus didn't want any more slave states
in the Union one example was David
Wilmot who tabled the Wilmot Proviso
which was supposed to ban any
territories acquired from Mexico from
permitting slavery but he got nowhere on
the opposite side senator Jefferson
Davis of Mississippi argued that the new
territory should be comprised of slave
state and that furthermore they should
annex Cuba slightly more
middle-of-the-road was Stephen Douglas
who argued for what was called popular
sovereignty meaning that new states
should be allowed to decide for
themselves these arguments culminated in
the compromise of 1850 which gave
statehood to California as a free state
allowed the New Territories in the south
to decide whether or not they wanted to
allow slavery and importantly it
implemented a new and very controversial
Fugitive Slave Law this required anyone
in any state even if a had abolished
slavery to Hambach escaped slaves to
their masters what this meant was that
the North had to actively play a role in
maintaining slavery which was not
something that they could abide also as
a side note in 1853 the US purchased
this land of her Mexico thus completing
its modern-day contiguous borders
throughout the 1850s anti-slavery
sentiment called abolitionism grew
throughout the north with men like New
York Governor and later Senator William
Seward in the much more extreme John
Brown being outspoken critics of slavery
in 1854 the kansas-nebraska Act opened
up large-scale settlement of migration
to those states whose position on
slavery would be decided by popular
sovereignty
thus proponents and opponents to slavery
flooded into Kansas to aid their side in
the debate this resulted in what is
known as Bleeding Kansas where by both
sides they're attacked and sometimes
killed the other further raising
tensions in the nation 1856 or the
pro-slavery incumbent President James
Buchanan of the Democratic Party run for
re-election he won but this election is
important because he ran against a
brand-new party the anti-slavery
Republican Party which for the most part
dominated in the north the next year
1857 saw a very important ruling by the
Supreme Court in what's called the Dred
Scott case this was where Dred Scott a
slave was taken by his master to
Illinois a free state Scott argued that
being in a free statement that he was by
law free the court wrote no and further
declared that black people were not
intended to be US citizens at all and by
extension they had no rights worth
protecting needless to say this was a
very controversial ruling and further
raise tensions between Pro and
anti-slavery factions 1858 so the
Republicans attempt a challenge Stephen
Douglas for his seat by putting some
chap could Abraham Lincoln up against
him Douglass defeated Lincoln but both
had taken part in his series of debate
which has made Lincoln well known across
the country and cemented him as a
leading abolitionist fortunately after
this tensions between the north and the
south between Pro and anti-slavery
factions died down and by died down I
mean got considerably worse the fear
abolitionist John Brown launched a raid
on Harpers Ferry Arsenal this was
supposed to cease weapons from the
government and give them to slaves to
incite revolt it didn't work Brown was
defeated captured and later hanged both
North and South were now in a state of
mutual hatred and there was talk in the
south of secession in 1860 things got
worse the Republicans nominated Abraham
Lincoln as their presidential candidate
in the Democratic Party was divided in
the south they nominated current vice
president John Breckinridge and in the
north they chose Stephen Douglas the
vote was split Lincoln won and since
Lincoln was an abolitionist many in the
South feared what he would do next
Lincoln was actually pretty moderate and
pledged not to interfere with slavery in
existing state but the damage was
already done before Lincoln had even
taken office South Carolina had declared
itself to have seceded from the United
States within a couple of months these
states had joined them this also
included Texas who had been in the Union
for like five minutes at this point
these states then went on to form the
Confederate States of America under the
presidency of Jefferson Davis during the
early months of 1861 South Carolina had
demanded that since they were
independent federal troops should
evacuate the federal government refused
to maintain their garrison at Fort
Sumter on April the 12th 1861 the
Confederate States Navy were part of the
fortune captured the next day thereby
beginning the American Civil War by July
these states had also joined the
Confederacy and thus will also award the
United States so before discussing the
war itself it's important to discuss how
both sides saw the conflict both sides
referred to the Declaration of
Independence to justify their fight the
north also called the Union cited the
all men are created equal bit whereas
the Confederacy focused on the right to
alter or abolish on just government's
bit the Union claimed that slavery
helped the entire nation back and
prevented the south from industrializing
and modernizing they also argued that
owning another human being was you know
wrong the Confederacy claimed that the
north was barely even American anymore
with all those immigrants there and so
it wasn't for those who lived there to
tell them what to do they also argued
that it was their right to form a better
Union since as far as they were
concerned the current Union did nothing
to protect their enshrined rights to
property that property being slaves so
in terms of strengths and weaknesses the
Union held massive advantages it was
more industrialized had many more miles
of railways and telegraph lines and had
a much larger economy it also had a
population of 22 million versus the
south 9 million of which three and a
half million were slave
and thus not likely to fight all of
these things considered it would seem
inevitable that the Union would crush
the Confederacy quickly but when the two
sides first clashed at the First Battle
of Bull Run
the Confederates won this was because
they had many competent generals the
most notable of course being robert e
lee the confederacy generally speaking
also had much higher morale because it's
much easy to convince men to fight for
the homeland than it is to get them to
fight for concepts such as Union and
abolitionism the Confederacy also hoped
to gain foreign support to which it
primarily turned to Britain Britain was
reliant on southern cotton imports and
when the Union blockaded the South it
meant the Britain's textile industry was
severely disrupted so in late 1861 when
the Union captured Confederate delegates
on the way to Britain in what is called
the Trent affair the British were
furious since it wasn't for the u.s. to
dictate who Britain could speak to
Britain postured but after Lincoln
released the diplomats tensions called
and Britain then told said diplomats
that they were on their own it was clear
that the war would not be over quickly
in 1862 played host to two important
battles the first was the naval clash
here at the Battle of Hampton Roads
which is important because it was the
first crush of ironclad warship the USS
Monitor and the CSS Virginia the
Confederates had hoped to break the
naval blockade but failed after this
came the Battle of Antietam which
despite the Union having twice as many
men was a stalemate but given that the
Union didn't lose this battle ax gave
Lincoln the opportunity to issue a
warning that unless the Confederate
states surrendered by the end of the
year he would abolish slavery the
Confederacy of course did not do that
and on the 1st of January 1863 Lincoln
issued the Emancipation Proclamation
which abolished slavery throughout the
states of the Confederacy but not in
those still in the Union which
incidentally now included West Virginia
which had itself split from Virginia
Lincoln couldn't unilaterally abolish
slavery everywhere since he needed the
permission of the states to do so since
the South was in revolt they didn't have
any legislators whom the Union
recognized so Lincoln could do it on his
own the Emancipation did shift the
framing of the war from one of
maintaining the Union to one of ending
slavery
this made Britain and France his office
of mediation that hypocritical since
they had already abolished slavery
themselves so 1863 also saw the war's
most famous battle the Battle of
Gettysburg which saw Lee attempt to
bring the horrors of war to the north
but he was defeated and subsequently ran
away this battle was seen as a bit of a
turning point and when Lincoln won
re-election the next year in a platform
of I'm going to crush them it became
clear that only total victory would do
the Union blockade was taking its toll
on the
soon after the loss of Atlanta to
General William Sherman it became clear
that the Confederacy was going to lose
and on April the 9th 1865 at the
Appomattox Courthouse General Lee
surrendered to grant effectively ending
the Civil War Jefferson Davis was soon
after captured the South was occupied in
the Union now had the difficult job of
repairing the damage
Lincoln was presumably very happy with
this victory but wouldn't have long to
enjoy it Lincoln took the time to go to
the theater and a man could John Wilkes
Booth a Confederate sympathizer took the
time to kill him Andrew Johnson
Lincoln's successor as president now had
to create a piece that could heal a
broken nation 1865 saw the passage of
the 13th amendment which abolished
slavery throughout the United States the
primary cause of the Civil War was done
away with and so began the process of
healing a nation but of course that
would take a long long time I hope you
enjoyed this episode and thank you for

anas Aro anas one of BBC's investigative
journalists have come out to speak on
their documentary on the late senior
Prophet tib Joshua now since the
documentary was released the questions
most people have been asking is that why
did BBC wait for tib Joshua to die
before they are now coming out with a
documentary on him a lot of people are
of the opinion that BBC should have done
this documentary on the late Prophet
Joshua while he was alive because now
that he's dead and they've done this
documentary on him how will he be able
to defend
himself and how will we be able to know
that all these so-called victims are not
lying against him since the dead cannot
speak well a nurse has come out to
answer our questions in a short
interview with ar TV he has explained
why the BBC released this documentary on
the late Prophet Tibi Joshua even though
he is dead watch the video that follows
for all the details thank you for
this just introduce for for those who
don't know you my name
ish and I work with
thec I'm you are part of this well um I
wouldn't say we all have contributed to
it to make this documentary sucess okay
now what is the major take away from
this well I think that the major take
away from this is the level of abuse
that we've all seen in this film and I
don't want us to look at it with the
lenses of religion it's a pure human
rights abuse story which all of us as
journalists have been do and when you
have a situation where girls have been
raped girls have been sexually abused
where there are manipulations of
Miracles and others it's about time we
say no to these things and we stand fa
and say it as it is let people know what
the real story
is a lot of people perceive this as an
attack on the church well I don't think
it is and I have emphasized that we are
not here to talk about Rel we are here
to talk about human rights abuses we've
done stories on human rights abuses all
lives as journalist this is not any
different from the stories we do and I
think that if there is something wrong
as journalist we should have the courage
we should have the the energy to be able
to tell it as it is if it's a human
right man is
now what what do you think what are
recommendations the death of a person
does not mean that the issue is there
there are
equally important and many victims who
have have suffered as a result of the
atrocity we talk about hler today he's
dead but we talk about the atrocities
and the human rights abuses that to we
talk about um um a lot of leaders
tutorial leaders who have committed
crimes and we still talk about them so
the death of a man does not extinguish
the crime we have to be bold as African
journalist to tell it as once it affects
have you thought about the trauma all
these women have going through have you
thought about the the problemss that
these people are facing how do we
address the situation there is
government um um side of it where when
the church broke down nothing happened
as journalist we should be asking the
question what was government supposed to
do why is it that nobody was brought to
when clearly the building fell as a
result of um structural def so these are
all issues we have to look at as
journalists and ask the right questions
to make sure that
there an
answer yeah so that was what anas had to
say about why the BBC released this
documentary on the late Prophet TI
Joshua even though he is dead please
what do you think about what he said let
us know in the comment section below uh
we realized that the video was very very
noisy we apologize I think when they
were interviewing him the place was very
noisy that's why the interviewer
couldn't help it and it appear yes he
was also one of the people that worked
uh on the on the interview anyway guys
what do you think uh also don't forget
to subscribe to the channel as we'll
bring you more and more videos until
then see you in the next one God bless
you
bye-bye

criminal cyber gang has stolen as much
as a billion dollars from
over 100 financial institutions over the
past two years
the gang which has been dubbed carbonac
carbonac
the authors of the report call it the
great bank robbery of the modern era
their ultimate goal was to steal as much
money as possible
and they largely accomplished that 2014
russia in the middle of the night
one of the kaspersky labs employees is
called by quote
the most stressed out guy he ever talked
to
unquote it was a bank employee of one of
the largest russian banks
and he was so paranoid that he didn't
even want to reveal what was going on
he feared that his phone might have been
bugged and his emails hacked
and insisted on a personal meeting as
soon as possible
it turned out that the bank's domain
controller
was sending sensitive data to unknown
servers in
china the domain controller is the most
important server of any business
and if you can access the domain
controller you have control
over everything else in that network
this means that whoever gets their hands
on this server
can do everything from looking at
insignificant customer data
to adding and removing funds from
accounts and
even sending millions of dollars through
the swift banking system so
if this server is doing things that
nobody knows about
the bank probably has a very big problem
astonished by the fact that someone
hacked into the domain controller of a
bank worth
billions of dollars the kaspersky
employees went to work
they analyzed every single network phone
and computer connected to the internal
banking network
at first they didn't find anything
suspicious
however some of the computers had the
screen sharing software vnc
installed on them and upon questioning
the bank about it
they found out that nobody ever
installed it
one of kaspersky's experts then thought
that someone must be spying on the bank
employees for some reason
to test his theory he opened a blank
word document on one of the computers
and wrote
hello he then waited and
waited and waited until the computer
suddenly began to type on its own
hello you won't catch us was the reply
the experts were now dead set on
catching the mysterious hackers
and went on to try and find out just how
on earth they managed to gain control
over something as important as the
domain controller
they discovered that a bank employee had
received an email from someone who was
claiming to be a legitimate customer
however
in reality this email was completely
fake
to make things even worse this email had
a malicious word document attached to it
the hackers had infected the file with
their malware
and once the bank's employee opened this
document
the malware activated itself and
installed a vnc
back door on the computer this is what
is known
as a phishing attack or to be more
specific
a spear phishing attack in these types
of attacks
hackers try to look as credible as
possible by creating emails that mimic
real people or businesses these emails
usually have an
infected file attached to them which can
be anything from a word
excel or powerpoint document and in some
cases even images or video files
once they successfully infected a
computer the hackers could now remotely
watch
and control the machine the attackers
then used this infected pc to infect
the rest of the machines connected to
the network and to search for the
administrator's computer
this is where the next phase of the
attack begins
they would slow down the admin computer
by running as many background programs
as possible
and hoping that one of the bank
employees would eventually contact
it support to fix the pc and this
is exactly what happened once the it
support arrived
they entered the admin passwords and
tried to fix the problems on the
computer
however unbeknownst to them they didn't
fix anything
instead they had just compromised the
security
of the entire bank thanks to a key
logger
a program that records every keystroke
made on the keyboard
the hackers obtained the admin passwords
and were now
able to log into the admin account and
infect the remaining network of the bank
the hackers now had access to absolutely
everything and this is where phase
3 started they would spy on the
employees for months until they knew how
they operated and what protocols they
followed
they were basically a shadow employee
silently watching and recording
everything the bank was doing once they
knew about all of the protocols the bank
employees
followed the robbery started
first of all they would impersonate
high-ranking banking employees and
manually send
massive amounts of money to their
accounts via the international banking
system known as
swift secondly they used the bank's
e-payment system to send money to their
accounts
which then again sent the money to other
accounts located mostly in china
and the us these accounts were then
emptied by the henchmen of the group
which are known as money mules
the next method was akin to the stuff of
hollywood movies
because the hackers had access to the
entire internal network of the bank
they were able to remotely control atms
and make them spit out cash whenever
they wanted
these atms were usually in remote places
and the money was once again
collected by money mules these methods
were pretty amazing
but it was the last procedure that was
the most interesting one
they would take accounts that had small
amounts of money in them
inflate them and then pocket the
difference
however this is where they messed up for
the first time
they accidentally inflated the account
of an elderly russian man who
only had 34 rubles in his account when
he went to bed
the next morning he had over 10 million
rubles in the same account
luckily for the hackers the bank thought
they had made a mistake and no
investigation was started
even though the experts knew exactly how
the hackers infected the bank
they were not able to find any traces
that would lead them to the stolen
9 million us dollars and the case was
eventually put on hold
a few weeks later eugene kaspersky the
ceo of kaspersky labs
traveled to a cyber security conference
in singapore
there he wanted to talk about his
experience with the carbonic hackers
and to his surprise it turned out that
this was not
an isolated case europol
the european union's law enforcement
agency
had also registered a few of these
attacks on european banks
the two then decided to team up with the
banks that had been hit by carbonic
different cyber security specialists and
a few experts from other intelligence
agencies
the group then formed the joint cyber
crime
action task force also known as jcat
and started to pour resources into
hunting the mysterious carbonic group
at first they didn't find any clues
about the hackers
until one of the kaspersky labs
employees found a tiny mistake
in the carbonic code this mistake
enabled the experts to send a request to
the carbonic command and control server
in basic terms if they sent a very
specific message to this server
they would receive a very specific
answer however
there was one problem they had to send
this request to the carbonic command and
control server and not any other server
but nobody knew the physical nor the
digital address of this carbonic server
this meant that the kaspersky team had
to literally
scan the entire internet and send this
request
to every single server connected to the
web
hoping that one of the servers would
eventually answer them with the message
they were looking for
after two days they got exactly what
they wanted
the carbonic command and control server
answered their request
and as a result of this the experts were
able to find it
the server was located in the country
with the best it infrastructure in
europe
and the second best connected country in
the world
the netherlands the dutch police quickly
managed to get their hands on the server
and invited the experts to investigate
it the analysis of this command and
control server then revealed the
terrifying true
scope of the carbonic attacks they
weren't just targeting banks in europe
and russia
but in almost every country in the world
from china bangladesh india and other
asian countries
to africa and even the usa tonight the
u.s
is under cyber attack as federal
officials warned that a likely
russian-based hack
has penetrated deep into u.s national
security infrastructure
the breach is widespread and there are
growing concerns tonight
about what may come next without anyone
noticing
the carbonic group had been infiltrating
hundreds of financial institutions and
stolen
over 700 million us
dollars after this incident the
investigation got a lot more serious
the jcat task force began to cooperate
with other intelligence agencies that
were also searching for the same
criminals
these included organizations such as the
fbi
cia romanian russian and moldovan
intelligence agencies
and many more as the experts got closer
to the carbonic group
they suddenly disappeared the hackers
went
silent for a few months only to return
and commit
the biggest mistake of their hacking
careers
taiwan 2016.
the cybercrime group was back to
business as usual
but two of the money mules were
inexperienced and would cause a massive
problem for the carbonic group
while they were retrieving money from
some hacked atms
an unsuspecting local taiwanese resident
approached the bank to also get some
money
as the resident approached the two money
mules got so nervous that they left as
quickly as possible
and forgot a stack of 60 000 nt
dollars in the atm surprised about the
strange behavior of the two men combined
with the fact that they left a decent
amount of money behind
the resident decided to alert the police
the taiwanese police then watched the
cctv footage of the atms
and immediately realized that something
was off
they acted incredibly quickly and before
the criminals knew it
the incident was all over the news the
first bank
reported that over 70 million nt dollars
was withdrawn illegally the withdrawals
were made
in both taipei and tai zhong across 34
atms and 20.
to make matters even worse the police
had over
500 officers going through all of the
cctv footage they could
and they eventually tracked down the
address of the two men
the competence and unbelievably quick
actions of the taiwanese police
then led to the identification of 22
suspects
most of them were russians and the rest
were from eastern
europe the carbonic group was now
in big trouble and even though 19 of the
22 suspects had already escaped taiwan
three were still there alone in a
country that was hunting them
and with millions of dollars in cash
one of the remaining suspects was a
latvian man known as andreas pergodovs
he was the alleged leader of the
operation and after he saw his face on
national tv
he quickly decided to cut his ties with
the money
he went to a mountainous area near
donghu park in taipei
hid two bags full of cash and proceeded
to travel to the yilan province
the other two remaining members of the
gang were still in taipei
and decided to store their part of the
stolen money in the luggage lockers at
the taipei train station
only a few hours later two men arrived
from eastern europe picked up the
luggage
and calmly went back to their hotel what
they didn't know is that hundreds of
police officers were watching them
through the taiwanese cctv
camera network once they arrived at the
hotel
and left their luggage in their room
they went to have brunch in the hotel's
restaurant
this is where the police finally took
action and arrested the two men
in a perfectly coordinated operation the
police also captured andreas paragudovs
on the same day
the taiwanese police had done what
nobody else could
and even though the arrested men were
only henchmen that didn't know much
about the carbonic group's leaders
the taiwanese authorities managed to
make the first arrest in the carbonic
case
this is where the manhunt for the
leaders of the group begins
spain 2018
spanish authorities were investigating a
criminal organization that was
laundering money
in spain with the help of interpol an
international law enforcement agency
the spanish police were able to find out
who was delivering the money that was
being laundered
and who their clients were through sheer
coincidence
they discovered that one of the clients
of the money laundering criminals was a
ukrainian computer specialist
known as dennis k after thoroughly
investigating this man
it was revealed that he had links to the
russian and moldovan mafia
and that he had coordinated several
cyber attacks for them
they had been cooperating since 2013
and while the mafia provided dennis k
with the money mules
he would pay a hefty 40 percent of all
of his profits to these eastern european
criminal organizations
dennis k and three other members of the
group were finally arrested in the port
city of alicante in 2018
and upon raiding their property police
found boxes full of jewelry
two bmws and 15 000
bitcoins which at the time were worth
about 150 million
us dollars the rest of the 1 billion us
dollars was never found
and even though dennis k was supposedly
the leader of the group
kaspersky labs believe that there are
many more people involved in this
either way the group is still active
today
and still stealing millions every year
operating under different names
such as fin 7 joker stash
cobalt spider and many more

The island of Tsushima is situated between
the southern coast of Korea and the Japanese
island of Kyushu.
Only a short distance from Korea, Tsushima
was a prominent base for Japanese pirates
to raid Korea, known as wakō.
As Tsushima itself was mountainous with little
arable land, many turned to providing for
themselves on the sea, either through fishing
or making the short trip to Korea.
In the thirteenth century the raiders found
Korea a particularly vulnerable target, as
the kingdom suffered continuously from a far
more fearsome enemy: Mongol horsemen of the
Great Khan.
Over a thirty-year period, Mongol forces repeatedly
invaded Korea, and the Korean King Gojong
was forced to seek refuge on an island.
During this destabilization, Japanese pirates
attacked Korea several times, though these
attacks ended by the time King Gojong made
peace with the Mongols in 1259.
It is these attacks which first brought the
Japanese, and Tsushima itself, to Mongol attention,
alongside rumours of the great wealth of the
Japanese monarchs.
When the new Mongol Emperor Kublai Khan began
sending envoys to Japan in the 1260s, demanding
they accept his Heaven ordained rule, Tsushima’s
close proximity to Korea made it a natural
stopover for the Khan’s messengers.
However, the Japanese government, the Kamakura
Bakufu under Hojo Tokimune, repeatedly refused
to even see Kublai’s envoys.
One returning group of frustrated envoys in
1269 captured two fishermen from Tsushima,
Tojiro and Yashiro.
The two were brought all the way back to the
court of Kublai.
There, the most powerful single individual
on the planet entertained two humble fishermen,
showing off his grandeur and demanding that,
upon their return, they would tell Hojo Tokimune
to show him proper respect, that the Khan
wished only to have the Japanese King at his
court, and to bequeath his fame to posterity.
On returning to Japan, the fishermen found
no more success than Kublai’s official envoys
did.
The continued diplomatic offenses were not
forgotten, and Kublai’s pretensions only
increased with the declaration of the Yuan
Dynasty in 1271.
With the fall of the key Song Dynasty stronghold
of Xiangyang, preparations soon followed for
an invasion fleet against Japan.
On the 2nd of November 1274 an armada of perhaps
20,000 Mongols, Northern Chinese, Jurchen,
Khitans, and Korean soldiers and sailors aboard
nearly 1,000 ships set out from Happ’o on
Korea’s southern coast.
Tsushima was where the hammer blow would strike
first.
By the evening of November 4th, the defenders
spotted the Mongol fleet off the Tsushima
coast.
Lacking naval powers beyond their small pirate
and fishing vessels, the Japanese had no way
to harry the Mongols at sea.
Tsushima was at that time controlled by the
Sō clan, whose head, Sō Sukekuni, was the
deputy shugo, military governor, of the island.
According to the Hachiman Gudokun, a Japanese
source written soon after the invasion, on
Tsushima there was a shrine to Hachiman, the
Japanese god of war.
Tradition holds that on the day the Mongol
fleet neared Tsushima, a fire broke out at
Hachiman’s shrine - a foreboding omen.
The fire was extinguished, and white doves
were seen gathering on the roof of the shrine.
As doves were the messengers of Hachiman,
Sukekuni interpreted it as a warning from
Hachiman: for why else would the god set fire
to his own shrine?
Some modern authors have interpreted this
as the doves having caused the fire, perhaps
from incendiaries tied to them and hence,
the opening salvo in the Mongol attack upon
the island.
Either way, news reached Sukekuni that a massive
fleet was approaching.
Sukekuni rallied his forces: some 80 mounted
Samurai and their retainers.
He led them through the night over rough terrain
to set up on the beach of Komoda, and prepare
for the dawn.
As the Yuan fleet neared Komoda beach early
on the morning of November 5th, Sukekuni sent
a small vessel out to inquire as to the purpose
of their arrival.
With the bakufu having rebuffed the Great
Khan’s envoys repeatedly, the time was well
past for talk.
Sukekuni knew chances of victory against such
a massive force were non-existent, yet lined
the defenders of Tsushima up for battle all
the same as the smaller enemy landing craft
neared the shore.
The primary weapon of the samurai was the
bow, their valuable and iconic yumi, with
which each warrior was highly skilled.
Like the Mongols, the Samurai fought as mounted
archers, though their maneuvers on horseback
could not compare to steppe nomads born into
the saddle.
The wealthiest samurai were well protected
in their colourful and distinctive yoroi,
though on a poorer island like Tsushima few
of the 80 samurai gathered by Sukekuni would
be so well armoured.
For sidearms, Sukekuni’s warriors had their
single curved blades, the predecessors of
the famous katana, while the remainder of
his forces were armed with little beyond spears
and naginata.
In contrast, the forces sent against him were
varied, commanded by the Mongol general Ho-tan.
Most of the infantry Ho-tan threw against
Sukekuni were Chinese and Korean levies raised
by the Khan, armed with spears, large wicker
or bamboo shields, and protected by cloth
and gambeson-like armours.
As per Mongol tactics, these troops considered
most expendable were sent in the first waves,
soaking up enemy arrows while the more valuable
Khitan, Jurchen, Turkic and Mongol horse archers
disembarked from the ships.
Generally lightly armoured but highly experienced,
their composite bows made them a deadly counter
to the samurai.
The sea voyage and need to lead their horses
from the landing craft meant they could only
slowly get into their formations, preventing
them from immediately trying to outflank their
enemies as was their usual practice.
While the Mongols readied their horses, the
Korean and Northern Chinese troops were sent
against the samurai.
Per Samurai tradition, battle began with a
whistling arrow sent high into the air; per
Mongol tradition, drums marked the start of
their own advance.
Sukekuni’s skilled archers took a heavy
toll on the foe marching up the beach.
As the Yuan forces neared them, challenges
for single combat by the Samurai went unanswered
by the Chinese and Koreans, marching as they
were behind rather un-samurai-like large shields.
Unused to the press[ure?] and greatly outnumbered,
Sukekuni pulled his men back to the treeline
where the Yuan advance was slowed.
Here, the swordsmanship of the samurai made
itself known.
One of Sukekuni’s closest comrades, Saito
Sukesada, brought down several of the Yuan
soldiers and one senior Mongol officer.
Standing over the fallen officer, Sukesada
shouted threats at the Mongols, calling on
any who dared face him in battle.
The Mongols responded with arrows, three of
which pierced the armour of Sukesada’s chest
and ended him.
In the tradition held in the history of the
Sō family, seeing the doom that awaited them,
Sō Sukekuni loosed the remainder of his arrows
into the Yuan, and led one final futile cavalry
charge into his foe.
In the end the defenders were slaughtered,
leaving the island open to the Mongols, and
over the following week Tsushima was overrun.
Towns were burnt, many were slaughtered, and
a number of women of the Sō family committed
suicide lest they fall into Mongol hands.
A worse fate awaited the prisoners.
Both Japanese and Yuan sources attest that
wire was threaded through the palms of the
prisoners, mainly women, who were strung along
the prows of the Yuan ships as a gruesome
necklace.
By the 13th of November, Tsushima had fallen
and Ho-tan ordered the fleet to the next island,
Iki.
Here, the deputy shugo Taira Kagetaka had
had time to prepare his forces, sending word
to Kyushu for aid.
After sending women and children to Hinotsume
Castle, he took 100 mounted Samurai and their
retainers to meet the Yuan fleet on the northern
beaches of the island.
Kagetaka’s forces held them off for a few
hours, slowing down the Yuan landing, but
were unable to prevent it.
As the Yuan foothold grew, Kagetaka had no
choice but to withdraw to Hinotsume Castle
in the evening.
Here, the small wooden walls would not long
provide shelter against the warriors who had
taken Xiangyang.
Kagetaka sent his daughter, Katsura-hime,
with a single samurai to take word to the
bakufu, and prepared for a hopeless last stand
as the Yuan encircled the castle.
Women and townspeople within the castle joined
in the defence, hurling what they could at
the enemy.
Catapults and Mongol arrows made short work
of those on the walls, and when Kagetaka attempted
to lead a valiant sally through the gates,
he found the Mongols pushing captive Japanese
before them, wire threaded through their palms,
living cover for Mongolian archers.
His numbers dwindling, Kagetaka led what was
left to the castle.
As fire began to engulf the fort and his remaining
men gave them what time they could, Kagetaka
watched his family commit suicide before he
too joined them in his final act of defiance.
Iki was thus overrun, and slaughter and other
atrocities followed.
Katsura-hime never made it to shore, her boat
coming too close to Mongol arrows.
Survivors, such as Katsura’s Samurai bodyguard,
brought news of the terrors on Tsushima and
Iki to the rest of Japan.
In popular tradition, upon learning of these
horrors the regent, Hojo Tokimune, stated
that this would be the most momentous occasion
of his life.
When asked by a nearby priest how he intended
to reply to the Mongol invasion, Tokimune
shrieked “Katsu!”
- Victory.
As we covered before, the Mongols would not
find victory on the shores of Hakata Bay,
where stiff Japanese resistance and an unexpected
storm pushed the remnants of the fleet back
to the Yuan realm.
Undaunted by the efforts of this small archipelago,
Kublai threw another, even larger fleet against
Japan after he had conquered the Song Dynasty.
In 1281 his forces returned to Tsushima and
Iki, though little information is provided
on these second encounters other than the
fact local defences once again fell quickly.
One detail provided is that Saito Sukesada’s
son, Sō Moriaki, continued in his father’s
legacy and fought the Mongols on the beaches
of Tsushima.
Another is that the crying of children in
the mountains of Tsushima alerted the Mongols
to the presence of families hiding there,
resulting in the deaths of 300.
Ultimately, the invasion of 1281 proved an
even greater disaster than the first, and
thousands of Chinese, Mongols, and Koreans
met their end in the sea off the coast of
Japan.
Local defenses on Tsushima and the Japanese
islands continued to be maintained during
the following decades for the possibility
of a Mongol return, which was threatened but
never materialized.
Emboldened, Japanese pirates once more began
to threaten the coast line, continuously attacking
Korea throughout the Yuan and Ming eras, and
in time ranging as far afield as Malaysia.
On Tsushima and Iki, memorials stand to the
brave samurai who stood against unstoppable
odds, local heroes who gave their lives for
the defense of their islands, small garrisons
against perhaps the most fearsome army in
history.

for sponsoring a portion of today's video.
(frantic screaming)
(horn honking)
- What, what!
- I love this movie. I love this movie.
- Welcome to the club pal.
- Wanna see it.
(laughter)
That's great.
- Ah, The Fast and The Furious movies
we all love the franchise
but technically they're not very good.
What if I told you that
there's an entire genre
of knockoff Fast and Furious
movies that make The Fast
and The Furious look like
The (beep) Godfather.
But the best of the best of the worst
of them all might be the movie
we're talking about today.
200 miles per hour, the
story of a young man
on a quest to avenge his brother's death.
The only way that he knows how
by going 200 miles per hour.
Today, we're gonna look at
some of the most moving,
well acted in action pack scenes
from this absolute Goliath of cinema.
I'm James. He's Justin. This is Nolan.
Let's go 200 miles per hour.
- Thanks to eBay motors

(playful music)
- Justin's seen it a cool dozen times.
I've seen it once and Nolan
has seen it never times.
I mean just the specifics alone all right.
It's written by a guy named Thunder Levin.
So if you're an initial D fan, you know
that literally translates to
- yeah, wait a minute.
- His name's Thunder Lightning.
He also wrote Sharknado and
it was directed by this guy.
So Nolan, are you ready
to experience 200 miles
per hour for the first time?
- I forgot that that's
what we're doing today.
So yes.
- Excellent. The movie kicks
off with our protagonist,
Rick, who is an amateur
racer working on his FC RX7.
His brother, Tommy, pulls
up in a brand new 370Z.
If you watched our video,
real mechanics react
to bad car lines, then you
might recognize this scene.
(crickets chirping)
- It's like an $80,000 car.
- No it's not!
- 0 to 60 in three and a half seconds.
- No.
- Quarter mile 11.5 seconds.
- No.
- And 193 miles per hour top speed.
(laughter)
Yeah. And it's not
gonna be stock for long.
- He's like yeah and
it's not gonna be stock.
- It's not stock but it's already modded.
Those aren't OEM stickers.
- Yeah. So this is 370Z.
- Yeah.
- You got a decent one for
like what? 12 15 grand.
- I love the vanity license plate too.
Ohh fa sho.
- That's possibly the
best vanity license plate
I've ever seen in my life.
- And very fitting for a 370Z.
- I am legitimately jealous
of that license plate.
- It's pretty good. Yeah.
- Oh fa sho.
- Oh fa sho.
- So yeah. We're two
minutes into the movie.
So far zero facts about cars are correct.
The brothers then head up to
the Sepulveda suicide race.
And at the Sepulveda suicide race,
they meet up with their crew,
including Claudia, Rick's girlfriend.
- Okay.
- And Kelly, the magical mechanic.
- Well?
- You've been messing
with my timing again.
Haven't you?
- It is my car.
- There. I fixed it
(laughter)
- Dude.
- She's like, alright.
- One. She can tell that the timing is off
by looking at a car that is off.
- That's awesome.
- And then she touches it like this.
- Yep. Boop.
- There I fixed it.
- Click.
- And then the bad guy shows up.
Kayce in his Nissan GT-R.
- Ooh.
- Kayce got his older
brother, Tommy, into racing
for pink slips.
- Oh, I think I
- Rick is like, "No dude
what are you doing?"
- Okay
- His brother like grabs
him by the back of the neck.
And he goes, "Hey you're
gonna be the first one to
go to college. I like that.
Mom likes that. I got this."
He's got that like Ryan Gosling like,
"Hey, you wanna go for a
drive? You want a tooth pick?"
(roaring car engine)
(tires squealing)
- Definitely speed ramp.
- Oh no!
(metal crushing)
Oh, oh no. Not the 350.
(Laughter)
- That's one of my favorite parts.
- That's my favorite part.
- Tommy!
- The whole crowd just teleports.
- Yeah. They're like a mile away.
- Dude is trucking.
And I wonder how many
takes they got out of him
before he was like,
(heavy panting)
like the entire plot of the
movie depends on the idea
that Kayce killed Tommy in this race.
- Yeah yeah yeah.
- Let's let's watch the tape back
- Let's analyze this.
(roaring car engine)
(tires squealing)
- No, Tommy just sucks driving.
- Tommy just sucks a driving.
(metal crashing)
(laughter)
The sound mixing is pretty
- Now the 370 is magically a 350.
- Oh.
- You know, what's hilarious
though, the first time he
turns right he rolls the car.
- He should be in NASCAR.
So at this point I'm like, alright
Kayce's not that bad of a
guy, but then he does prove
that he is like a real,
like, kind of crappy dude
because he shows up at Tommy's funeral.
- Bold.
- Yeah. And demands that
Rick give him his card.
- Whoa!
- Because he was racing for pinks.
And if he can't have Tommy's car
then he needs to have Rick's car.
They decide to race.
- Okay.
- Now back to the garage and
Kelly lays out her plans.
- Take a look at this.
I made some sketches.
- Oh nice.
(laugher)
- That's the Pumphrey 502.
- Oh nice.
But like, I also want to call
out all the eraser marks.
- They just had someone
set like draw a car.
- I bet the director drew it.
- You know what? This just might work.
- That's gonna be awesome.
- Okay.
- They've said that four times.
- I think this is a good time to call out.
There's a theme in this movie
that for some reason, the biggest fear
of going fast in these cars is
that it will lift off
the ground and fly away.
- I love it.
- Maybe 10 times in this movie they
bring up the concern
of the car flying away.
You're not worried about
popping the engine.
They're not worried about, you know
anything other than the car flying away.
- Yeah.
- Kelly's sketches are approved
and now it looks like this.
(upbeat music)
That is sick.
- That is sick.
- Okay. It's green now.
- I love it.
- Hey. You don't think I'm
letting you take my baby
out without me. Do you?
- So now it's green, right?
Totally understandable.
- Yep.
- It's gotta spoiler on it. That's cool.
- Yeah.
- Time for a first test drive.
- Let's do it.
- All right I want to know
if you notice anything
about the car.
- All right. I'll pay attention.
(engine roaring)
(tires squealing)
Oh, it's a Nissan now.
- Apparently during filming
the RX-7 was stolen.
- What?
- Yes. So that was on
set in a trailer with a
truck attached to said
trailer all belonged to
Justin Pawlak, the former drift driver.
- Whoa.
- And it all disappeared.
- Hi Justin.
- Whoa, that sucks.
- Yeah.
- So you know when I originally
saw this movie, I was like,
It was so hilarious that
they just went out of
their way to build a lookalike car.
But that's what happened
- That's wild, man.
- Rick goes to see his girlfriend.
She's very upset that he's racing.
So he leaves there comes
back to the garage.
He's like, yo, I gotta
go test the car again.
- Let's see what happens.
(engine roaring)
Oh no. It's the cops
- Oh. Oh. Flying real low.
- Just wait.
- Son of a (beep).
(laughter)
- Whoa.
- The effects are amazing.
- I love this movie. I love this movie.
- Welcome to the club now.
- I wanna see it. That's great.
- I just wanna mention that we're only
30 minutes into this 90 minute.
Yes. So they try and out run the cops.
- Somehow they avoid that
stunt driving helicopter.
- Yeah. They avoid the helicopter.
Helicopter's gone parked in a parking lot
and in broad daylight.
The cop catches them.
- You, on your knees! Elbows in the air.
Don't you (beep) move.
- What do you mean elbows in the air?
- Is this really necessary?
- Is that a message from Kayce?
- No.
- No.
- That's a message from me.
The man who has your balls in his hand.
- Again underwrite the techno babble
overwrite the tough guy.
- The balls in his hand.
- I think that was ad lib.
So the cop demands that Rick
like forfeit the race to Kayce.
Because if you haven't noticed,
he's a bit of a crooked cop.
They head back to the garage,
meet up with the crew.
But wait a sec, did they
hit 200 miles per hour
in the helicopter chase?
- 160 miles per hour.
- 160.
- Wow.
- Son of a (beep). I
can't believe we did it.
- They made that up.
- I love that.
- Those guys were rehearsing lines
and they made (beep) that up.
I love that.
Yeah. Those guys are having fun with it.
- Do I know my ground effects or what?
- Do I know my ground effects or what.
She attributed to the top
speed to the body kit.
- How are we gonna make it any faster?
We've done every mod made for it.
- We could use nitrous.
- Nobody makes a NOS system for the MX-5.
And there's a reason for it.
- MX-5. See again, I think
this was written for Miata.
And then they found a way cooler,
in my opinion, car to be the hero.
- Or they thought it was
a Miata the whole time.
- Yeah. Maybe they
thought this was a Miata.
They track down the only guy
in LA to ever run nitrous on an MX-5.
And Rick goes and pays him a visit.
- I saw the Speedo hit 180
but I really wasn't sure because
the car was shaking so bad.
The front end began to lift up.
- He sounds like he's given a testimony
- Flipped (beep) over end
right through a second story window.
I was wearing a four point safety harness
and that thing came apart.
I flew out the car window,
landed in a pile of (beep).
- What?
- Going 140 hits the switch
car literally takes off.
But then, but goes (beep) over end.
- He falls out.
- Some point his four
point harness breaks.
He goes out the window.
This is a now in a house.
He falls into a pile of (beep).
Domingo's like, yo you
can have my kit for free
if it helps you beat Kayce.
Because if Kayce's outta the
game, that's more money for me.
Then something messed up happens.
- Oh.
- Kayce follows Claudia,
Rick's now ex-girlfriend.
So it is a 12 minute scene of
this guy following this woman.
It's a lot of time to spend
on something like that.
What are you doing Thunder Levin?
She runs out.
Rick picks her up.
Oh, I also wanna point
out the nitrous button
is the windshield wiper
switch in the RX-7.
So he hits the nitrous
to get away from Kayce.
(engines roaring)
- In his 240
- Get that alignment checked on.
- Oh look 160 dude.
Ah, look at his speedometer.
His speedometer got a label maker over it.
It says MPH.
That is a thermometer.
- That's a air pressure gage.
- It's air pressure gage.
Art department's like I found hack.
They just turned the
compressor to 160 pounds.
Okay. So again, he just
saved his girlfriend
from being taken and he's
stoked about going 160.
- Yeah. He's in the middle of the
- It works we're not taking off.
- Take this piece of (beep).
- It works we're not taking off.
We're not flying in my car.
Even at 160. We're not flying.
So they're still moving now.
But then wait till we cut to the wide.
- (beep) you.
- Definitely moving.
- Oh my God.
- Rick!
(cars crashing)
- That's why his bumper's all messed up.
He's doing that to himself
(frantic screaming)
(horn honking)
- What? What?
- Well, he just lost his car.
- Oh, I didn't think about that.
- He lost his car. He's fine.
So he goes back to the
crew and they're like
we got a crazy idea.
Remember that 370-Z that
got rolled 27,000 times
that your brother died in?
We're gonna go steal it
from the police impound.
And you're gonna race that.
- All right.
That's a hair brand idea if
I've ever heard one. I'm in.
- It seems is impossible but Kelly,
she says she can do anything.
She rebuild the car in two days,
which you know is totally possible.
- Just go down to the dealer.
They'll give you parts.
- All right.
So the car's fixed. Ready to rock.
They line up for the final race.
- Let's go.
(tires squealing)
(car crashing)
- Oh no, my light pole.
- He's a good guy.
- Kayce!
- Kayce!
- Kayce!
- They don't show any wreckage.
It's not the budget.
- Think about this.
You can't shoot him.
They'll know it was a gun.
- He's got a point.
He's got a point.
- He's got a point
- But this next move he does is legendary.
- They have the technology.
- You're right. I can't. You can.
- Where'd that gun come from?
And it's already taped up.
- One, Two,
- Hey, Flynn.
- And the crowd teleports again.
- She's a genie.
- She's a genie.
- She has magical power. She can teleport.
She can fix things with
a touch of her hand.
So then what happens?
- Rick realizes that racing won't
bring his brother back then.
Domingo Juarez shows up.
- Domingo Juarez.
- Remember he landed in the (beep).
Domingo offers Kelly a
job on a NASCAR team.
She says, she'll think about it.
And then he pays Rick a
hundred thousand dollars
for the 170.
- Because it has historical value.
- Right.
- That's great.
- Yeah. And now Rick can go
to college and that's 200 miles per hour.

1848, and the Austrian Empire
is having some trouble.
This trouble occured on March the 13th in Vienna,
When a crowd, mostly made up of students, demanded more rights,
And the government obliged.
By shooting them.
Which led to riots. This riot was a part of larger trend of revolutions which swept across Europe in 1848
To oversimplify, they were largely concerned
with improving the working lifes of the peasantry,
Increacsing democratic representation,
and in many cases wanted to form states along national, ethnic and linguistic lines.
This was bad news for the Austrian Empire,
since it was very diverse. It included
many ethnic groups such as Germans, Hungarias, Czecks, Slovaks, Ukrainians
Called Ruthenians at the times
Poles (known as Galicians), Croats
Serbs, Italians, Romanians and many, many others.
Some of these people wanted better representation, and others preferred outright independence.
The events in 1848 spread outside of Vienna quickly, and March 15th
In the city of Pest, revolutionaries demanded extra rights and soon after
declared Hungarian independence.But Ferdinand would still be their king
The central government struggled to respond
affectively. and in Italy the Austrian army withdrew from
from most of the revolting Italian states. this left them wide open
for invasion.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

like walking into here there's nothing
in here that's like oh yeah I might want
to try that I've tried celery I threw
that up instantly I don't want to
say I'm addicted to mac and cheese but
because it sounds so weird but like my
body won't let me eat anything else I
didn't choose to be like this why do
they have so many broccolis you know do
you eat the bush I never would have
chosen to be like this looking at that
there's like Gore I'd rather have random
chemicals than knowing that like I got
to drain the blood out of my meat oh I'm
actually like serious like like this is
a problem it's weird for me to think of
eating any food that's not yellow my
name is Austin and for the past 17 years
I've eaten almost nothing but mac and
cheese
[Music]
this is my go-to pan and I don't really
like to deviate there's another pan that
my grandma sometimes uses but like if a
different pan gets used like I can tell
I try to keep everything super specific
that way stuff just stays the same I'm
20 years old and I live in Keystone
Heights Florida
it's a backwater for sure everyone was
kind of the same and if you were any
different than the norm it was super
weird like I've seen it's kind of crazy
all stacked up like that kind of puts
into perspective just a week supply of
mac and cheese at all times I don't
think I've ever really met anyone who
said how I don't like mac and cheese
I love this cheese because some good-ass
cheese this is what normal cheese looks
like to me you know there was some
cheese sauce should look like not a
heathen
so I don't eat with this like a wooden
spoon I eat with some silverware I'll
just take a seat at my desk and normally
I'll just watch some YouTube will eat
most of my diet like nine times out of
ten in the gaming night is gonna be
Velveeta shells
I'll eat deluxe for cheese and normal
craft Annie's and Bob Evans Bob Evans is
pretty good for like I'm microwaved mac
and cheese I think most people see Mac
and cheeses that comfort food I mean you
can't deny how good mac and cheese
tastes man like it's definitely still
like a comfort food for me it's cuz it
does taste good
I'm like a walking advertisement for a
bubble you know Internet but it's
definitely a problem I'm sick of it but
in the same way like I don't want
anything else you know
when I try to eat new foods the first
thing that happens is like blinders on
the food gets to the point where it's
like somehow in my hand I'm about to eat
it like that
as soon as I enters my mouth it's just
like a sensory overload of all the
things this is the texture this is the
consistency this is how it feels in your
mouth Oh Oh God there's the taste and
there's a bunch of new flavors that
you've never experienced before even if
I like what I'm trying I'll still have
like this just kind of involuntary gag
if I don't like it sometimes I'm
actually just straight-up
thrown out like on the spot I've never
bought anything other than mac and
cheese for myself whenever I go shopping
this is all that I'll eat of velveeta
like I don't like any of these other
things so Vitas always just been the
most consistent it always tastes pretty
much exactly the same I didn't even know
they got many ones but I don't even want
to try the mini ones just cuz they'd be
different you know like two different oh
the bacon one grosses me out I can't
stand the thought of mixing that with
mac and cheese white bean I don't know
what that is anything that adds to mac
and cheese like don't it's mac and
cheese not mac and cheese and white bean
like in this it's an abomination you're
going into some some vomiting territory
I hate peppers this makes my stomach
queasy just like looking at it the
texture of pasta and it was like my
favorite because it's like not mushy
until you chew it I know it's so bad for
you when I read the ingredients I don't
know what enriched macaroni product
means like like a bunch of stuff that
I'm familiar with but then a bunch of
other stuff that sounds like it could be
used to make like a chemical weapon I
could get some four cheese but like nah
nah there's definitely a lot of things
I'm missing out on because of not eating
that thing whatever that is like the
color throws me off of that like the
color makes me upset I have any one
worked up the courage just because like
bitter things is such a strong reaction
meat is like the worst one to me that
was like a chunk of meat from an animal
that had like muscle and fiber and like
veins in it oh my god uh it's kind of
like a comfort zone in the hellscape
that is the raw meat vegetables I know
that I need to eat do you just eat an
eggplant like just take a bite out of it
or like what do you use a knife plant
for it when I'm over there at the mac
and cheese out I know that there's
something that I can walk up to and yep
pick it up put it in my cart like this
my girl I'd rather just stick with my my
ride-or-die you know
what brings you to counselling at this
time I have been doing or ears with
being and extremely picky eater please
dr. Dean
my social life and I soon fear it will
begin to my physical health this is my
contact information for the therapist
that I found I even find out that
selective Indian disorder was an actual
diagnosable disorder until I was out of
high school I was laying in bed and I
was just scrolling through YouTube it's
like seven people who eat only one thing
or something like that it was by good
mythical morning good mythical morning
what if you could only eat one thing for
the rest of your life that is the
question of the day thought about that a
lot at the very beginning he starts
specifying egos so this is an actual
disorder
it's called selective eating disorder
it's where these people have an
avoidance to new foods and they just
latch on to one food and I was like oh
my god I'm not crazy like it has a name
this thing that's been hanging over my
head so that means that I have a point
to attack it from have you seen him
Intel professional before yes I have I
was recommended to go to a mental health
professional by DCF where I was
diagnosed with PTSD from an abusive
household my parents did the best they
could with what they had my dad was
really awesome sometimes and sometimes
he was not so awesome you know like
there's a lot of conflicts it would get
physical between me and my dad and where
I actually got removed from the home
that day was I was asked to take the
trash out and so like I took the trash
out and there was like a stack of papers
right after the trash and so my dad
comes out and he starts yelling at me
for taking his lid I guess it was like
payroll papers or something something
really important like that he comes up
and he tried to take my my skateboard
for me because of course I skateboard
and he walked back in he was like I just
snapped up
I just amped that board I just
your board over my knee and like that
was the first thing that I'd ever bought
like on my own like with my own money
and so like I just turned and I kicked
at the wall my foot went through the
wall
my dad charged at me knocked me down and
pummeled me while I was on the ground
and he slammed my head into a coffee
table I was all bloody and I passed out
on on my neighbor that was when DCF came
in and started like an investigation it
was definitely during that time were
like I was like just super super sad
that's where I get the idea from like ie
mac-and-cheese because like in that time
it was the only thing that like if I
asked for like on a bad day wouldn't
cause conflict I had to learn how to
make it myself it was always like well I
know that I'm gonna have mac and cheese
like I can control that he never could
say why he didn't want to eat anything
else
we've never forced him I never tried to
force him that's real hard for me
because I'm from old school I was
brought up to someone fixed my plates
you eat everything without it and you
stayed there till you did eat everything
that was on it I love my grandparents
they're very accepted they never make me
feel ashamed about it it's never like
you need to change you have something
wrong it's always like we're just
worried that you're unhealthy I think
you'll always be with me yeah
and I don't care hey he wants to stay
here until he's thirty it's okay with me
maybe not so much grandpa but he's a
good boy Jerris like my brother
essentially he's like my best friend
above all I can probably count on two
fingers the amount of time that I've
brought up like my eating which eret I
think he had told me about it before the
okie eight was mac and cheese and it
seemed kind of weird at first but I
don't really judge people I don't know
cuz it's like if you want help I'm not
against helping you but it you know it's
kind of one of those things like you
can't help someone that doesn't want
help yeah and it seems like you get a
lot of opportunities to try all their
foods and you showed no interest in it
so again I'm not going to push the issue
because I know I can't change your mind
true I definitely used to be embarrassed
like oh man I'm just weird there was a
time where like I just felt excluded I
barely ever even really go out to eat
with my friend because I don't just be
sitting at the table with my plate of
mac and cheese as opposed to everyone's
full plate a lot of people struggle to
understand
so like a lot of people that I choose to
tell about it don't ask you know because
they they know that I'm actually like
serious like like this is a problem you
know heading to ground zero boxing it
became like a thing where like I just
wanted to prove to myself having the
background of like my trauma as a kid
and having PTSD and not being able to be
around any kind of like physical
conflict to like going and being in a
ring or so on and just like straight
beating the out of each other it
felt like I was like I was making myself
feel worthy I started boxing three years
ago whenever I went for the first couple
of times like I just loved the working
out and then I loved feel like I was
like a part of something my coach's name
is Giovanni he's just the best dudes
like a dad to me
I exercise four times a week really
heavily at the gym I got up to like a
really unhealthy weight because I
stopped going to boxing so I could tie
I'm at the age now where I know that my
metabolism has slowed down I definitely
know that I have to maintain physical
activity to keep myself it is to
counteract my terrible awful carb filled
diet I went to the doctor for a physical
five weeks ago now it's a new doctor so
I told him not only eating mac and
cheese for like 17 years and he was like
when you're older it's gonna be a
problem
music but for right now I have no
worries part of me kind of wishes he
would have said something more scary
than you're fine I feel like I need
someone to tell me like you don't change
like you're gonna fuel the consequences
you know he told me at a mac and cheese
diet and I was like what
as I well you know you're boxing but
you're gonna have to start eating right
if you want to go ahead and get in
better shape come on show me your winner
let's go when it comes to mental health
issues if you can't talk about what's
going on then you can't get the help you
need I feel like a lot of men think
that's a weakness when it's not you know
there's a problem the weakness is
ignoring it let's go let's go finish
strong pretty strong that's all you got
now bad kid not bad so grandpa and
grandma send my love okay of course more
than anything I want to be like my best
me and I'm taking steps to get there
tomorrow I'm meeting a new therapist
named Ashley I hope it's gonna give me
the ability to be at a neutral unbiased
stance whenever I try new foods it's
like the stepping stone to being able to
do the things that I want to do easier
it's been about two years since I've
been to a therapist office she had never
dealt with anyone who had sed her
solution was to just just go home and
like soak some broccoli and cheese and
just try it if only it was that easy
whenever I left there to try and find
another therapists office it was very
very difficult and has proved to be very
difficult to find any reasonable
therapist who takes my insurance
insurance companies seem to think that
mental health is like a luxury you know
nice to meet you we're gonna take a seat
tell me more about your story for so
long like it was just a shadow that just
like loomed over me
as soon as I knew that it had a name
like it gave me like a hope wait what is
a normal day like running eating for you
I'll have like a box of Velveeta shells
mac and cheese that's typically just
what I eat through the day like that's
it pretty specifically that brand a
single kind right I'm just alone in my
room eating it and if you went back to
that planning piece what do you see in
that dinner has always been water pan
pot you know like on the stove eight
minutes and then like you're done that
means we want to look at what meals have
been like throughout life I never
remember ever eating family dinners like
at the table and I would always eat mac
and cheese all the adults said it was
just like oh it's just an it was picky
eater phase yeah anytime I try something
new even if I like the first bite of it
I almost will always have an involuntary
just a gag what's the experience that
goes with that gagging what have you
noticed oh it's embarrassing I think
it's super embarrassing I think through
the lens of trauma a lot mm-hmm so have
you experienced physical abuse yes and
so if you think a fight flight or freeze
yeah I was a freezer can you relate
those feelings now to what it's like
approaching foods if I sit down and like
I'm in a room with the intention of
trying a new food then my stress like
immediately skyrockets like and it like
stays up until like the penultimate
moment hits we're like I try it and then
like I have that guy reflux I'm like all
right out of the way I didn't like it
and then like it's it's done and then
like it goes down or like I get out of
the room and then it goes down you
basically draw the stress curve of your
hand whenever you're done yeah what's
happening that's part of what my job is
to teach people yeah to understand
what's happening and that it will have a
beginning and end it's going to come up
yeah and it's gonna go down like a wave
right but we often feel it rising and
think that it's gonna continue to just
go up yet what we want to do as we're
approaching foods as know what might
happen
okay and regardless we're going to be
working on building skills to keep you
grounded in your body you know we'll be
looking at a hierarchy of foods that
you'll establish right and so it's
exposure and then it starts to
extinguish some of the fear we build a
new pathway and that pathway it looks
like I actually can feel this feeling
and go forward right and with I just
hope like I can get to a place where
like I'm equipped to deal with like what
I'm feeling when I try new foods that
way I can try new foods out like a
neutral unbiased look you know like
instead of just having the massive
anxiety associated with it you know it's
completely separated from from like who
I Who I am you know it's like a relic of
whenever I was in like a worse mental
place and like it's just kind of stuck
with me you know like that is a really
great way to conceptualize it yeah it's
a part of you you don't need anymore
yeah but that is so deeply ingrained
that it's still there yeah you have a
lot of insight you're pretty motivated
to do it yeah oh yeah for sure
so I can like slowly open up like what
restaurants I go to and stuff you won't
be able to go to more restaurants more
restaurants just be more social with
with with eating and stuff you know what
we'll do from here is just look at
frequency and when you can come in next
so that it can make the most of your
time in your commute I'm super excited
all right Austin thank you so much for
coming in yes I'm so excited to work
with you safe travels back thank you
very much you have a good day
it was wonderful meeting Austin he has
so much insight and such an openness to
developing a better understanding and
he's truly motivated to do this work
even though he knows it's gonna be
really uncomfortable for him I think we
went better than expected
actually she's definitely really cool
definitely gives me hope especially
since she's so confident and how much
I'll succeed like makes me it makes me
feel really good makes me feel really
confident mac and cheese for money is a
comfort food for Austin well it has had
that effect it's not about that anymore
he would like to be able to eat other
foods to have variety and to eat
vegetables nobody feels crippled and
paralyzed by the idea of doing so and so
he falls back on mac and cheese because
it's what his brain and body will allow
it's where he can have some peace and so
you're having to work against your body
to get yourself to sit with food in your
mouth the perceived threat is so much
more than the actual experience but you
can't convince your body of that without
doing a lot of work to chip away at it
I'm not ashamed of Who I am I wouldn't
want my kids to see me just eating mac
and cheese all the time well while my
kids eat a more balanced meal than me oh
my god I found out about selective eater
sorter just by pure luck it was just
like an aimless thing that just hung
over me and like I just thought like
that was just one of my idiosyncrasies
it's like one of my little quirks I
definitely didn't choose to be like this
at all this selective eating disorders
has its hooks in me and it's just like
holding me back
it's exciting thinking like I could get
to a point where like I'm able to try
new foods and possibly you know like
them and enjoy them
[Music]
hey I should have been talking about
something dramatic

[Music]
oh
right i'm ready
what just happened
hello i like money
[Applause]
[Music]
hello internet welcome to film theory
the show that's all about soaking up
knowledge like a sponge over the years
we've done our fair share of spongebob
theories from concluding that spongebob
was actually adopted to trying to solve
the krabby patty secret formula but to
this day there's been one very popular
theory that we've never touched and that
is the nuclear mutation theory basically
the theory that all the sapient sea
creatures that we see on the spongebob
squarepants show are the result of
nuclear testing now that might initially
seem like a logical leap like why would
anyone jump to such an extreme
conclusion about the backstory of these
characters but when you stop and
actually look at the evidence there's a
lot here that adds up with the biggest
point being that spongebob's home is
called bikini bottom named after the
infamous bikini atoll which as you may
know is a group of islands in the south
pacific located more than 3 000 miles or
5 000 kilometers off the coast of
australia basically in the middle of
nowhere this remote location prompted
the us government in the 1940s to say
hey this seems like a great place to
test our nuclear weapons and boy howdy
did they do a lot of testing on those
islands according to official reports
the united states detonated 23 nuclear
devices during the time including one in
1954 that was 1 100 times larger than
the hiroshima atomic bomb in a lesser
known part of the story there were
actually about 150 people living on
those islands that they had to relocate
during the period of testing and then
they sent back to live on the island
seriously in the 1960s there was
actually an attempt to resettle the
bikini atoll islands something that
ended in the 1970s when they realized
that um living on a former nuclear test
site ain't great for your longevity it's
honestly a horrific story and also real
scary how little scientists back then
knew about the full ramifications of the
nuclear weapons they were testing and
that child friendly story is where
bikini bottom got its name no theory
there friends just pure fact it is
directly mentioned on the viacom
international website program
informacion for the show and since it's
common knowledge at this point that
radiation causes mutations hey maybe
these humanoid sea creatures are the
direct result of said testing at the
atoll so that's the theory friends i've
certainly heard worse heck i've
certainly made worse in fact the theory
was so good that it got mainstream
attention back in 2017 when the
huffington post interviewed spongebob's
voice actor tom kenny they asked him
point blank what do you think about the
popular theory that spongebob is the
result of nuclear testing and rather
than trying to dance around the question
he confronted it outright quote well
bikini bottom is kind of named after
bikini atoll you know where they did
nuclear testing decades ago but i don't
think spongebob and his friends are
mutations i think bikini bottom is like
its own world when the camera drops
below the water and you go to bikini
bottom it's almost like it's another
planet you know there's never topical
references in the show there's never an
oprah joke or who wants to be a
millionaire joke or anything topical or
pop cultural in spongebob and i think
that helps keep it really timeless and
everlasting end quote uh
what never a pop culture reference tom
have you seen the show that made you
famous you've got references to mary
poppins too bad you forgot your umbrella
a clockwork orange
otherwise known as number 655321
that iconic scene from rebel without a
cause
and sure those are just cultural
references but then again what about
this how will we ever get back to bikini
bottom now i can take you there who are
you i'm david hasselhoff david
hasselhoff riffing on his 80s tv series
baywatch yeah and regardless you have a
squirrel that's explicitly from texas
it's texas spongebob even sings the
ever so humble there's no place like
home song in an episode i'm not trying
to be mean to tom kenny or anything i'm
just trying to establish that this is a
world that very clearly interacts with
the real life surface world thereby
meaning the bikini atoll theory has legs
to stand on horrific disgusting mutant
legs anyway that's his opinion but again
he's just the voice actor could it be
possible that stephen hillenburg the
show's creator intended for this to be
the case he was after all a creator who
was formerly a marine biologist and
cared about things like humanity
polluting the ocean so why not start a
series about the pollution of nuclear
fallout and that sponge boys and sponge
girls is what we're exploring today
we're looking into both the science and
lore of spongebob to definitively prove
or disprove this massive fan theory and
let me tell you this the final result is
not only surprising it's actually the
first time something like this has
happened on film theory no joke a
theorist first so put on your best
theorist pants friends because i'm ready
i'm ready i'm ready for a theory review
leave your theories in the comments
below
i'll pick my favorites in the next
episode of morty
first sure it's named after the place
but is bikini bottom's location in the
show plausibly near bikini atoll in the
pacific ocean yes it has been proven
time and again that bikini bottom is
indeed in the pacific ocean in the
season 3 episode pranks a lot we see
sandy launch herself out of the ocean
and back to texas and she comes from the
east and in the spongebob squarepants
movie as our titular yellow rectangle
sings goofy goober rock the camera zooms
out of the ocean specifically at the
location where bikini atoll is irl it's
not the most accurate of globes but if
this is australia and that's north
america here's where bikini atoll is irl
and here's where they zoomed out of in
the movie yep it is definitely real
close even the sea life that we see in
bikini bottom lines up here we see all
sorts of animals large and small filter
through the town but large permanent
residents like pearl the sperm whale yep
bikini atoll is absolutely within her
range of habitat blue whales like frank
the whale yep in range puffer fish like
mrs puff yep and on and on the list
continues so just from the initial check
here yes bikini atoll lines up both
geographically and marine biologically
with the places and characters that
we're seeing throughout bikini bottom so
let's now look at the science of
radiation most media tend to treat
nuclear radiation like magical fairy
dust that just gives special powers to
anything it touches why is the hulk
green and super strong radioactive blast
where did peter parker get his spidey
sense radioactive spider how did
professor x become a telepath a
radioactive bomb at least if you're
reading the x-men comics from the 1960s
yeah they've kind of washed over that
part of marvel comics history but in the
early days professor x was the result of
his parents working on the first atomic
bomb anyway even spongebob the show
leans into this trope with the character
atomic flounder who's apparently so
radioactive that he can just cause
people to spurt extra mutant arms by
touching them with his nuclear touch
careful medical boy he's got nuclear
touch now of course that's part of an
in-world tv show that spongebob and
patrick are watching on a vhs tape and
not really canonical to the true setting
of bikini bottom but it does demonstrate
that the concept of nuclear mutation
does exist within this fictional world
which then begs the question just how
realistic is the trope this isn't just a
digression it's a question of science if
steven hillenburg wanted to ground his
show in some element of science just how
close to real science is this concept
well it's certainly far off but also not
as inaccurate as you might expect i
think we all understand that nuclear
radiation is bad and dangerous right
like i don't think any of us are eagerly
running away to roll around in the dirt
of chernobyl hoping that we become the
next jubilee a former nuclear testing
site is generally not the kind of place
that people or marine wildlife are going
to want to live nor the kind of place
where they're going to be able to thrive
and build a fully functioning marine
society well sure it is true that
nuclear radiation results in mutations
the vast majority of them are bad and
not just like a little bad they're bad
in a cause your organs to stop working
properly kind of way so does that mean
that nuclear radiation is a non-starter
and trying to induce beneficial mutation
like we see in spongebob no because
while most mutations are actual death
sentences it doesn't mean that all of
them are see for instance the atomic
gardening movement of the 1950s which
aimed to intentionally induce mutations
in living plants by blasting them with
radiation now before you get too excited
about this being a way to help your
petunias grow it's important to remember
that most plants didn't fare too well in
these experiments in gamma gardens as
they were called gardeners would arrange
a 5-acre circular plot with a radiation
source in the middle the plants nearest
to the center usually died and most
others featured what researchers at the
time described as tumors or other
abnormalities but there were incredibly
rare situations where the mutations were
actually beneficial in nature and you
see that right there's the point the
breeders who are trying to develop new
types of plants didn't need all or heck
even most of the plants to survive the
process their goal was to just take the
most genetically fit or genetically
interesting from each generation and use
those seeds to create more of them it
was essentially a way of accelerating
the process of selective breeding
instead of waiting for interesting
mutations to occur naturally you
artificially induce them using radiation
and according to dr pierre lagotta of
the international atomic energy agency
radiation breeding has produced
thousands of useful mutants including
varieties of rice wheat pears peas
cotton bananas and peanuts and going
back to bikini atoll for a minute sea
life seems to be returning there
according to a recent article the place
is slowly coming back to life with quote
coral the size of cars as well as
schools of fish and crabs that eat
radioactive coconuts all of this is to
say that while the spongebob nuclear
testing theory might seem absurd on its
face or something that would only work
in science fiction it is actually based
in some level of scientific fact it is
certainly possible from a scientific
angle that this theory could work except
there is one big problem that ultimately
debunks this theory and that's time
because while the bikini bottom nuclear
testing theory does indeed square with
some real world evidence what it doesn't
hold up against is the tv evidence the
actual lore of the show the entire basis
of the nuclear testing theory is that
the intelligence of bikini bottoms
residents and their ability to create a
human-like society is the result of
mutations that happened in the 40s and
50s when the island was being bombarded
with nuclear devices the big problem
there is that bikini bottom has a
history far older than that in the
episode dunces and dragons we flash back
to the 12th century and see that bikini
bottom back then bikini bottom shire was
home to a basic society of sapient sea
creature don't hold thy breath we'll be
lucky if we get fed again by the 12th
century bikini bottomshire had the
ability to verbally communicate a basic
system of government basic architecture
in other words all of signs of animal
intelligence that we see from them in
the present day centuries before us
humans ever started messing around with
nuclear technology at the end of the
episode spongebob tries to brush it all
off as some dream huh patrick but
patrick quickly subverts that worn out
trope by pointing out that one of the
citizens of bikini bottom shire the
king's jester squidly has time traveled
back to the present along with them
besides that spongebob's reactions
throughout the episode and the existence
of the medieval moment stadium in the
present day confirmed that the
civilization of present-day bikini
bottom has a history dating back to the
medieval era 12th century don't you see
patrick we really are in medieval times
and the history of unnaturally
intelligent sea life in bikini bottom
goes back even further than that all the
way to the prehistoric era surely we all
remember the primitive sponge and
primitive star memes that originated
from season one
what are you simpletons doing and while
these two might not seem like the
shining example of advanced animal
intelligence just take a look at them
they're wearing loincloths which mean
that they're sophisticated enough to
create clothing and while they haven't
developed a spoken language squidward is
able to train them to use basic tools we
see the same thing in the episode
spongebob bc where prehistoric society
has advanced enough that we see basic
language starting to develop
[Music]
i could list more examples here but i
think you get the point usually in these
videos the lore leads us to a ridiculous
theory that eventually gets debunked by
science but this time it's actually the
exact opposite the lore is the thing
doing the debunking there's no denying
that bikini bottom is inspired by and
named after bikini atoll and as we
explore today the marine life matches up
the real world geography matches up we
know nuclear testing happened there heck
we even know that in super rare cases
nuclear fallout can result in beneficial
mutation from that perspective the
citizens of bikini bottom could
absolutely have been made into the
advanced society they are today as the
result of human experimentation but the
theory just doesn't hold up when you
actually examine the lore of the series
bikini bottom was advanced centuries
before humans discovered the destructive
force of radiation an unexpected outcome
to be sure but it looks like the nuclear
testing theory just doesn't hold water
or as you might say it's just a theory a
film theory and if you're looking for
something that does hold water or soda
or milk look no further than these
reusable dishwasher safe cups that we're
selling over on food theory that's right
you goofy goobers food theory right now
has merch which means that i now have
another bullet point on my modeling
resume in all seriousness though if
you're a fan of spongebob i recommend
you check out our latest food theory
episode where we tested the double
krabby patty with the works in real life
let's just say it performed incredibly
well as incredibly as this food theory
apron looks on yours truly follow the
link below to watch that episode and
check out food theory merch because food
theory's got it all t-shirts reusable
cups aprons pizza plushies that's right
now you can have your very own slice
just like i had back in my theater days
so don't be a kelp for brains make your
theory dreams become a reality today and
cut

you

during my travels in india
i met a man at an ashram he was about 45
50.
a little older than everyone else
he tells me a story
he had retired and he was
traveling on a motorcycle with his wife
at the time
coming behind them
a truck ran into them
and it killed his wife
and he was
badly injured almost died
told he wouldn't necessarily walk again
in a coma for a while
when he came out of it and found out
what had happened
he
naturally was devastated and
heartbroken and
physically broken
and he knew that his road ahead of
rehabilitation and
physically and psychologically was going
to be hard
he had one friend who was a yoga teacher
who said we're going to get you started
on the path to recovery
so she came over and
threw yoga helped him be able to walk
again
after he could walk and
regained his ability to move around
he decided to head to india
and
explore some more yoga and while he was
there he
started to learn about meditation and
hinduism and buddhism
so he told me that you know he never
would have
thought to ever go down this path he
would have probably laughed at anyone
who
goes to india to find themselves
you know i said did you
get what you were hoping for
and he said
even though i lost my wife
i've never been happier
because it put me
on this path
i remember joking with my friend in high
school
that
can you think about not thinking we
noticed that the mind never stops
thinking
and we noticed that you really can't
think about not thinking
and that was a
kind of a question that
plagued me for a long time
there's a greater wisdom
that comes
when we're not clouded in thought when
we're not lost in thought when we're
addressing exactly what's happening and
not some mentally constructed
simulation of what's actually happening
we
always see movies and they have this
beginning and end but any movie you see
something happened before it started we
just don't see it
so we fall for this illusion that things
have this beginning and end
for a long time physics believed that
there was a beginning to the universe
and only now they're beginning to say
there might have been something before
that
we get attached to certain
people and
forms and
things and situations
the truth is nothing less the truth is
things will always change
when i was an ad man in new york
i had a unique perspective of
how
marketing and advertising works and how
it creates
demand
and how it influences people to
want products they would never normally
have wanted
and i was responsible for a lot of that
[Music]
more money
more clothes
more
luxury items more
cars vacations
nicer home nicer furniture
we all know this feeling of you want
something you get it you feel this rush
of dopamine and then very soon after you
crash and you want something else
the native americans have one of the
most beautiful concepts in the world
they have 10 000 different languages and
all these tribes and none of them have a
word for ownership or possession
they don't understand the concept of how
something can belong to one person
it's really a man-made legal
you can't
truly own anything
what you really realize is that
so much of what people get obsessed
about and go crazy over is just not
important not necessary
yeah i i suffer because i
crave things that i don't have
and i
have an aversion to things that i don't
want
when you can just
step back and see the big picture and
know that good things will come
good things will go bad things will come
bad things will go
then your happiness doesn't
rely on any kind of external situation
that's the key to lasting happiness
a lot of people
in our modern materialistic world
think that success equals happiness
that if they just get this position or
this raise or
this bonus they'll be happy
but personal experience as well as
scientific studies have shown that once
people's basic needs are met
more money

one
book i read was called becoming your own
therapist by a high buddhist llama
and that's to me what i found that
spirituality really is
when you realize
that
life is an illusion that
everything is one
that everything has meaning because we
project meaning onto it
that you can
kind of awaken from this
rollercoaster of life
step off
and just appreciate
in the marvel at the you know
engineering of the roller coaster or the
complexities of life instead of feeling
so
attached to it and consumed by it
we all have spiritual moments
throughout our lives
that first moment you see a sunset
or a flower
maybe a piece of art
and you just say
wow
and and in that really true awe
and wonder you know that childlike
wonder that
school's usually beat out of us
that is the moment we're all
fully present
fully alert
fully appreciative
and and there's a
a real connection
made between
the experience and the experiencer
god and the universe are really
interchangeable
words
the universe loves us god loves us have
faith in the universe have faith in god
it's all it's all the same i mean if if
god is everywhere then god is the
universe and
you don't have to believe in god to
believe in the universe
i am god but so are you
so is everybody
so treat everyone like god
including yourself
and remember
[Music]
even though you're god
you're no better than anyone else
[Music]
a wise man
once said
the universe created itself to
experience itself
through us
names are useful in that
they help you
know who someone's talking to
but they can also
be a deception
because the truth is we're all just the
same we're all one
who you are
who you think you are the the
personality you've constructed and that
other people have told you you are
your name your class
religion
whether it's a sexuality or a
gender or
nationality
this physical body
is
your house
you are
the inhabitant
and
the you i'm talking about
is the life force energy
the
conscious awareness which there is no
physical part of the brain or body
that science has
found that is responsible for
consciousness
and when we focus
on these
labels and identify
with our
temporary
experience
we mistake
our deepest sense of self with some
temporary experience
and we see people as labels
instead of infinite
beings of potential
and it allows for a dehumanizing
of each other
if you were to look
at human skin
under an electron microscope
you would not be able to tell
where the human being
begins and ends
[Music]
there is no
fine barrier between the person
and the universe
there is just
a flow
from one to the next
and the only reason we perceive
separateness is because of the
limitations
of our senses
[Music]
human beings can only see
[Music]
0.0001 percent
of
the spectrum of light
and we can only hear point zero zero
zero one percent of the spectrum of
sound
if we could see
infrared and if we could see ultraviolet
and x-rays and energy and
hear
the whole spectrum of sounds
the universe would appear very
differently
there would be no empty space
it would be so full
we would just see this sea of energy
and there would only be oneness
there is no
separate you
no separateness
there's a deep interconnectedness
there's only oneness
there's a difference between
loneliness and aloneness
loneliness is when being alone causes
suffering
but aloneness
is ultimately
recognizing
others as yourself
when you realize
that you are one with everything
[Music]
all suffering
exists in the mind
no matter what happens to you
[Music]
no matter how terrible
there can be peace
you are not your trauma
you are not your circumstances
[Music]
you are that
eternal
unchanging
light of consciousness
your true nature cannot be hurt
your body can be hurt your property can
be lost
[Music]
but nothing can touch the true you
space
silence
and
our
pure conscious awareness
are similar
in that nothing can alter those states
you can never freeze space or burn space
or
alter
space
in any way it's eternal
and unchanging
this is the nature
of
our true selves
the realization comes that
it's not your life you can't possess
something you are
you are life
all the
knowledge and wisdom
is in each and every one of us
you don't have to read any book or
belong to any religion
this is
a universal
and
available to everyone
way of living
never forget that every moment is a
miracle you know that's that's the goal
of spirituality is to
never
forget that
death is the beginning of the
last great
adventure and
exploration of humanity it's every
person
gets to go explore this thing that no
living person knows about
death and of itself is a beautiful
process it's it's like being born
death is the great equalizer no matter
how rich or how poor we're all going to
that same direction
everybody lives on through
life living on
we're all
the same life force energy
[Music]
and that
that'll go on forever
life will go on experiencing
the universe
as
the universe intended
[Music]
we've all been everybody
and we'll all be everybody
[Music]
it's it's about enjoying the good times
while they're here
and knowing they won't last
and when the bad times come
we uh
we know they won't last either
[Music]
[Music]
imagine a movie
where the camera is shaking all the time
[Music]
it would be
the worst movie you've ever seen
you could barely
focus on anything that's going on
and you'd probably walk out in five
minutes
stillness is
everything
an opportunity
to observe
our chaotic mind
and allow it to settle down
no matter what else is happening
[Music]

on the 6th of March 1945 American tanks
from the famous third Armored Division
fought their way into the heart of the
German city of Cologne
desperately trying to repel the American
advance and hold the vital bridge over
the river Rhine were the last few tanks
of the once formidable 106th Panzer
Brigade
What followed was a unique chapter in
the second world war captured in real
time by combat cameramen on the ground
in this video we'll use the latest
technology and wartime footage to follow
the Epic action that is today known as
the cologne tank Jewel
by March 1945 the Western Front looked
something like this with the Germans
being pushed back towards the mighty
Rhine all along the front including just
here in Cologne
Shattered by Allied bombers it was a
shadow of its former self but
nevertheless as Germany's fourth largest
city still represented an important
Allied objective
let's wind the clock back to 1945 and
blend the wartime aerial over the modern
satellite image to see the city as it
was then
one key location is the impressive
Cologne Cathedral which even today
dominates the Metropolitan City Center
and conveniently for us serves as both
an orientation point and the American
objective in the fight
it was in the shadow of this Cathedral
that the famous tank Jewel would take
place
but to get there we need to move
westwards and back in time a little
by early March U.S forces of the
legendary spearhead division found
themselves here on the outskirts of
cologne having fought non-stop since
Normandy
leading the advance into the city were
the tanks of Colonel Leander Downs task
force x some 45 in total but in this
video we'll follow just two
this Sherman 76 commanded by 26 year old
Wisconsin native Lieutenant Carl Kellner
and Eagle seven a brand new Pershing
tank commanded by Sergeant Bob early
the Pershing in particular was important
weighing 46 tons with 100 millimeters of
frontal armor and a powerful 90
millimeter gun the five-man tank was a
big step up from the far more common
Sherman albeit a largely untested one in
action all that would soon change
but just why is this action unique in
second world war history well it's
thanks to these guys a group of
journalists photographers and combat
cameramen who were embedded within the
leading elements as they Advanced
meticulously capturing still images and
footage along the way foremost amongst
the most staff sergeant Jimmy Bates Leon
Rosamond and Fred ramage who armed only
with cameras ran all the same risks as
their armored comrades
so what exactly were the Americans
facing in truth it's hard to be precise
it was a chaotic time for the German
Army but we do know that remnants of the
badly Mall 363rd Volks Grenadier
division were in place in the area we
also know that at least three German
tanks from Panzer Brigade 106 were in
the vicinity on the far side of the rail
bridge and were to be thrown into the
fight last minute in the attempt to stem
the advancing American tide
the plan of attack was something like
this units would push in on each flank
of the city sealing off any Escape North
or South whilst at the same time a
central column led by the tanks of enf
companies of a 30-second armored
regiment would attack from the Northwest
driving into the Heart of the City to
capture the cathedral and hopefully the
vital hohen zollin Bridge Over the Rhine
our route in this video will follow this
Central advance
let's get straight down to the ground to
the Village of pulheim to pick up the
story
we know that the Americans were here
thanks to at least a few landmarks still
standing in the area which can be traced
today
it was here at about 10 a.m on the 5th
of March that cameraman Jim Bates
captured footage of the American column
advancing down this road at this time
all the tanks of task force x revising
down the same route and met Little
Resistance until they reached cologne
suburbs it was here that the Infantry
came into their own advancing with the
armor their role was to clear houses
along their route of Advance it was a
tough job requiring GIS on the ground
with plenty of guts to be first in the
door by mid-afternoon on the 5th of
March The Wider part of the venlor
Strasser a road leading directly to the
city center was reached
this exact location we can identify on
film today is it allows us a unique
opportunity to follow these leading
tanks
here we see the early's eagle 7 was
firing towards the old Cemetery as they
continue to clear a path eastwards
by the end of the day the westernmost
suburbs were cleared and those famous
twin spiers of the cathedral were
finally in sight albeit some way off
it's likely that U.S forces held here
for the night regrouping and rearming
for the much Sterner test that was to
follow
on the other side of the city the
Germans too were preparing late in the
evening a Panzer Mark IV arrived from
Southwest Germany at the Eastern Bank of
the Rhine after a hellish Journey under
continual Air Attack 18 year old Gunner
Gustav Schaefer was glad just to be
alive only to learn that the following
morning he was to advance directly into
cologne
let's take a moment to understand the
situation on the morning of the 6th of
March it's likely at this time that the
single group split and took two separate
but parallel routes into the city one a
group of four Shermans led by eagle 7
taking the suburata Strasser and a
second group including kelner's 76 and a
75 millimeter armed Sherman continuing
along the vinlo estrasse the aim being
for both groups to converge on the
Square in which the cathedral stood
it seems that the camera team split two
with Jim Bates and Liam rosaman
following the group led by early's
Pershing and another team including
Clarence garrel and Fred ramage
following the pair of Shermans along the
second route
only a few roads apart the tanks would
remain in radio contact throughout
let's return to Young Gustav's Schaefer
shortly before 10 AM he recalled
receiving the order to advance and
describes what happened next
we drove three tanks right over the one
Solon Bridge into the city once there
two tanks were immediately directed to
the Central Station when we had crossed
the bridge and the other two drove to
the Central Station an officer told us
to drive further into the city we then
ran for the restaurants passing the
cathedral until we came to an
intersection
now we know that by 10 am on the 6th at
least three tanks a mark IV and likely
two Panthers Advanced into the ruins of
cologne commanding one of the Panthers
that day was Oberlin Wilhelm Battleboro
an experienced tank commander holding
the Iron Cross first and second class he
was to take up position as per orders of
course unknown to the advancing
Americans in a tunnel just north east of
the cathedral
returning now though to the Pershing
group accompanied by cameraman Bates
they also Advanced directly towards the
mark IV commanded by Ober Felder Rolf
militzer with Schaefer at the Gun Site
the nerves were incredible on both sides
as the two tanks cautiously close
distance slowly feeling their way
through the rubble-filled streets a
civilian vehicle driven by a local
grocer Michael delling with his employee
27 year old Katarina Esser in the
passenger seat came racing into view
apparently trying to escape the
approaching firefight in the almost
deserted City they unknowingly drove
straight between earlys and militar's
tanks with tragic results
tents with nerves and unsure who
occupied the car both Clarence smoyer
the gunner in the Pershing and Schaefer
in the mark IV opened up riddled by
Machine Gun fire the opal slew to a stop
with delling dead at the wheel and young
Katarina Esser mortally wounded beside
him
as is often the case in the fog of War
civilians find themselves caught in the
crossfire
no one else in Cologne that day would
have been shaken by an enormous
explosion moments later as the Holden
zolan rail Bridge the last possible
Lifeline for the German armor in Cologne
was blown up by German pioneers
there was now no way out it would be a
fight to the end
with each tank now alerted to the
presence of the other by Trace of fire
smoya caught sight of the mark IV as it
hastily reversed behind a building
now out of sight for its location known
smoya decided on a new course of action
and repeatedly slammed armor-piercing
rounds into the five-story building
directly in front of the enemy tank the
resulting debris which collapsed onto
the Panzer blocked its turret from
rotating
surrounded outgunned and demoralized by
the blowing of the bridge and the damage
to their tank sergeant militar and
Gustav Schaefer had finally had enough
they exited the tank running down this
road and into a side street before
taking shelter in a nearby Hotel
basement apparently determined to fight
on the remaining three crews stayed in
the damage tank and from here disappear
from the pages of History
with the path now clear the Pershing
cautiously began to advance towards the
cathedral with infantry and Camera team
in tow
by shortly after midday we've left the
left Advance at least clear for some
distance with the Pershing leading of
firing as it moved on the right though
things were so far were looking quieter
both counters and the accompanying
Sherman working as a pair had reached
about this point identifiable clearly
today by the remains of this Roman Tower
by matching our on-the-ground view with
the footage of that day we can see the
same point and the way in which the
tanks advanced
all seem to go well until emerging onto
this street just a few hundred meters
from the foot of the cathedral a series
of destroyed buildings blocked any
further Advance watching on with his
camera in hand was Clarence garrel and
British photographer Fred ramage
having called in a specialist Sherman
bulldozer to clear the route the crews
were waiting with girl slightly to the
left rear of the second Sherman
now pointed his camera directly down the
street at a darker area amongst the
rubble he wasn't to know it but hidden
here in the railway tunnel was
BattleBots Panther seconds later a 75
millimeter armor-piercing shell slammed
into the gunshield of kelner's Sherman
tearing through its armor and probably
killing driver Julian Patrick an
assistant Gunner Curtis spear outright
about seven seconds later a second shell
hit the Sherman and as Geral continued
to film Lieutenant Kellner and Corporal
John Gia Luca emerged from the smoking
turret with kellner's left leg clearly
having been lost in the explosion
Gravely wounded Kelner made it just a
few yards behind the tank before
collapsing
tragically he would die a short time
later and is today buried in his
hometown of Sheboygan Wisconsin he was
just 26 years old
shocked by what they'd seen and unaware
of the enemy Tank's location the crew of
the second Sherman began to reverse to
cover behind a rubble pile when it too
was hit this time in the right track by
the concealed Panther with its crew
abandoning though powerfully rather than
fleeing the area several crew members
ran to the aid of Kelner the moment
being captured by Fred ramage's
photograph which later appeared in Life
Magazine
in the space of less than a minute two
Shermans have been knocked out by an
unseen Foe and three men had lost their
lives
but where exactly was this enemy tank
today we know from a letter written by
battleborth himself that the panther had
taken up position beneath this bridge
close to the railway station and it was
from here that they had spotted and hit
the two Shermans taking the distance
from the known points and the visibility
along the street which by the way is
much wider today than it was in 1945. we
can calculate that the shots were fired
from this exact location at a distance
of some 340 meters
we know from Clarence smoyer that a few
minutes later f company's Commander
contacted the commander of e-company who
in turn contacted early informing him of
what happened and asking him to go down
and take out that tank
now aware of the very present danger
somewhere along his route of Advance
early decided to get a better look from
something like safety before risking his
tank
entering this building through these
lower Windows he climbed the stairway to
a mezzanine along with Jim Bates
in the meantime the panther had finally
broken cover and moved forward some 100
meters to take up a new position right
here
covering three lines of approach to the
cathedral to the left Center and right
it could command the area but was also
now far more exposed
electing to face its strong frontal
armor directly forwards towards the
knocked out Sherman battleboreth seems
at that time to have been unaware that
the powerful Pershing was actually much
closer and off to his right
let's take a moment to understand the
situation at this critical time so Bates
and his camera along with early have
climbed one set of stairs to get a view
out of a window on the end of this
building
the Pershing minus its Commander for the
moment is stationary here and a few
meters to the rear and filming up the
street is rosenmann the panther itself
facing towards the two knocked out
Shermans is approximately here
it was just after 2 p.m when Bates
photographer Jim Hines and early reached
this window and standing well back into
the room to avoid being seen spotted the
panther side on some 120 meters away
Bates later recalled his conversation
with early
he told me to stay there and he would
come back in his tank and try to put the
German tank out of commission and I
could photograph it he had one of the
new M26 pershings with the 90 millimeter
gun
Sergeant early said he would turn into
the square under me stop and fire at the
German tank
returning to Eagle 7 and briefing the
crew as to what they should expect they
fired up the 500 horsepower Ford V8 and
began to advance smoya a well-trusted
member of the crew have been told not to
wait for an order but to fire as soon as
he got a shot hoping at this range that
the pershing's powerful gun would knock
out the panther with a single shot
inside the panther Bartel Booth faced
with three possible routes of Advance
made a decision ordering his Gunner to
Traverse to the right possibly having
heard the engine of the approaching
Pershing life and death for both Crews
was now down to a matter of only
milliseconds
as the range closed and the Pershing
cleared the corner building Bates having
moved up one floor to get a better View
and with rosaman in the street began to
roll
hesitation was the deciding factor
as Bartel booth and his Gunner peered
through the dust at the first signs of
the emerging Pershing he reportedly
called Don't Shoot
knowing that Schaefer's mark IV was in
the same vicinity and apparently not
recognizing the silhouette of the
Pershing hit the two unseen on the
battlefield he believed it may have been
one of his own tanks
by the time he realized his mistake it
was too late
the Pershing had cleared the corner and
without stopping slammed around from
only 110 meters directly into the side
of the panther
jolted by the explosion and likely in
fear for his own safety Bates a ducked
at the moment of firing and missed the
first impact but rosaman to the rear
filmed the Pershing shot
Bates rose again just a few seconds
later capturing the second round
smashing into the Panther's side armor
and kept filming as smoke began to
billow out
knowing that further rounds were surely
coming battleboard was already
abandoning his tank with his crew
following after
the famous cologne tank Jewel was over
but what became of This Crew captured on
film as they fled their burning tank
a detailed look at Bates 16 second film
clip slowed down and stabilized when
combined with the outstanding work of
German historian dick lubker allows us
to try and piece together the sequence
of events
the first clear frames in the bass
sequence show the turret Cooper hatch
opened and a crewman presumably barter
both himself standing up we also see the
impact hole of the first shell on the
Panther's side
for the next four seconds the tank
commander struggles to roll onto the
Panther's front deck before dropping to
the ground
the next frame show the tank commander
running for cover and the radio
operators still emerging from his hatch
at the front right of the tank and also
diving off the front deck
as he disappears The Gunner begins to
emerge from the same cupola hatch which
the commander exited
finally the driver emerges from his
hatch at the front left about the same
time as smoya's second round strikes the
tank very likely killing the Gunner who
is yet to exit
over the total sequence we see four of
the five-man crew in view with surviving
records suggesting that battleborth
driver kernig and one other man were
late and taken prisoner a fourth Unknown
man died of his wound after escaping the
tank and a fifth was likely killed in
action
Bates footage is truly powerful it was
then and it is now
a snapshot of a moment in time which
affected all of those concern for the
rest of their lives
Clarence smoyer was no different
he reflected years later
I never went to that tank and looked
inside but they told me all of the crew
perished there I thought about it many
many times when we were firing I don't
remember seeing them getting out it
always did bother me that they all had
to die I'm happy that some of them did
survive very happy
immediately following those actions the
Pershing reversed stopping outside this
building some 100 meters away
leaving their position in the upstairs
window Bates and rosenman emerged onto
the street to join them it was here that
this famous scene was captured showing
the crew of Eagle 7. no doubt simply
glad to be alive
the battle for cologne was over
Bob early Clarence smoyer and the men of
third armored eventually went home as
did Gustav Schaefer Wilhelm bartelborth
many of their comrades didn't
smoya himself never forgot that day at
the Cathedral and returned several times
after the war to visit the spot from
where he fired those famous shots
on one trip in 2013 he met Gustav
Schaefer whom he had last seen through
his Gun Site 68 years before
they got on well and left his friends
so that brings us to the end of this
short video we hope you enjoyed it and
want to send special thanks to diet
lupka whose Research into this subject's
been vital and piecing this incredible
action together

[Music]
most people
think it's a nutty idea
[Music]
no nuclear war is going to happen man's
too smart for that
and if it does be signs it'll mean the
end of everything so there's no need to
worry about
that's the way everybody feels
there's enough nuclear destruction
that if 100 other maybe even a
thousandth
of it were used in the world of
50 000 nuclear weapons
well it wouldn't take many just to
destroy
humanity forever
[Music]
my life has been a completely different
life than most people have
i went into service when i was 17.
[Music]
i spent four years on active duty then
and i was at one of the five bases in
the united states
where secret aircraft were allowed to
land
we were sending these planes off to look
for these
russian bombers that were coming into
our space
and i could see you know the threat
in a different point of view
if you looked at it at that time how
many people thought there might be a
nuclear war
oh it was like 60 70 percent of the
people
60 70 percent of the people today do not
think there will be a nuclear war
but there's 10 or 20 percent
we're very convinced that there will be
i've been working on this concept
of the r2 it's developed over time but
now for 60 years i've been expecting
this
great catastrophe
i started off with four buses
and then i came into a larger amount of
money
i sold the company i had for 50 million
dollars
with the additional money we extended
the shelter
when we quit we were at 42.
the arc ii is completely overkill is the
shelter
it's supposed to withstand a blast mile
and a half outside the crater
you'd almost have to hit it on top
people show up and say you want to trip
through it if you would see it i say
why
i mean just here to
take my time you think boy crazy guy
doing this
generally people just think i'm crazy
i was totally lost in my younger years
trying to figure out what life was about
and i searched like most people don't
i went every area one can look to
try to find the truth
we're created with a purpose everyone
individually
we have free will and we can choose to
follow that purpose or not
[Music]
does this catastrophe occurs
i have this dream that i want to help
the society recover
[Music]
we're doing it for other people
everyone's welcome to come
we live a totally different lifestyle
than anybody else
we don't buy new cars we never go on
trips or vacations
[Music]
kids were just raised with it and
everybody thinks it's crazy
people are looking they say well that's
a strange person
he doesn't have the kind of goals and
all
that we have
[Music]
whatever is put out because it's being
published in
the newspapers or over the tv
that's what you believe
[Music]
i'm just someone with a different
view that they therefore discount
[Music]
everything that i do and everything that
anybody does
it's going to come to naught
[Music]
eventually
[Music]
i've often thought all the time i wasted
doing
this business that thing that project
you know
that's was my path and i followed it
consciously and conscientiously
and i've come to discover
that i dare not change one thing
in the least

the badlands home to some of the
strangest creatures ever to walk deserve
they were designed to serve in the event
of war but they have long since been
abandoned now without masters they're
perverts to the one thing they
understand fighting
we begin our journey on CB dustbowl
commonly known as a heart of war this
desert is where it all began and after
so many years it would be thought that
the blue team had developed some pollen
scents however that is not the case and
they still suicide into the red team in
the beginning of every mission they've
yet to realize that the red team places
Sentra's in exact same spots every time
but one day they will learn the red
team's goal of course is to prevent the
control points from being captured by
the blue team one method they have used
to correct effects is a strategy of
shooting through walls that has being
demonstrated by this heavy however he
soon decided it's not working in this
case and shoots the stairs instead the
blue team intentional capturing the
first control point using uber in an
attempt at pushing past the red team's
line of sentries it looks as though it's
working but the red team also has an
evil which they pop resulting the
mountains ersity between the two teams
they know they can't damage each other
so they just stand that staring until
the uber runs out which point in the
heavy and medic come to their centres
and retreat in the aftermath as heavy
appears unsure what to do the blue team
was advancing and after a moment of
thought he decides to try and defend
their control point along with his
engineer who attempts to build a century
unfortunately it is too late in the red
team are driven back leaving blue to
capture the control point over a control
point number two the engineers are
already preparing the lines defense
however they seem to be having trouble
upgrading their sentries they've both
built them in truly awful spots and one
of the engineers had rather run around
aimlessly than doused the file in his
building the other engineer eventually
upgrades his central tier level 2 but
unfortunately aspires other ideas he
sneaks past the entire red team and
places sappers on both turrets an
engineer comes running but he is too
late to save his own century before it
is destroyed
he then completely ignores the sapper on
the level 2 proceeds to burst entry in
the corner the second engineer is know
it to be seen and is presumed dead
meanwhile this blue engineers I'm
significantly more luck than the red
team's engineers he has already built a
century a teleporter editor Spencer and
upgraded the central to level 3 what he
is defending though nobody knows he has
been cursed by being on a attacking team
building central slowly will ever know
that is all he will ever do until death
claims him back at the second control
point the red team's decided to abandon
centuries altogether instead they've
come up with a much more sophisticated
plan that is for the entire team dwarfs
kind in one place nonetheless as anyone
would expect this turns out to be a
terrible idea
and they're quickly and brutally
massacred leaving the control points but
captured by the blue team though at
first the Scout seems to ignore the
obviously deserted area instead running
straight to his death the rest of the
blue team however see the opportunity
and grasp it winning the battle though
that was only one of many battles to
come on the way to our next destination
we make a short detour a cost nucleus as
Liz it will be short but the arrow
demonstrates an important part of the
behavior of bots for a beginning of
every round the bots committed mass
suicide Erling themselves straight to
their deaths largely looking back the
eyes fixate on the control point which
they're being programmed to capture they
never learn only obey and because of
this thousands of BOTS die every day our
next location is PL upward the blue team
here is attempting to block the enemy
base using a bombs and conveniently
placed tracks of course the red team
hasn't thought of removing the tracks
all they know is killing which doesn't
cover manual labor you'll notice here
these demo men are placing some
elaborate sticky traps it doesn't matter
where they put them bots never look
anywhere before word so they just shoot
as sticky bombs in the cartridge general
direction meanwhile at the blue team's
engineer as waited to build his
teleportal entrance at this point where
he will build the exit not even he knows
but he knows one thing that is he must
build a teleporter entrance however the
fight begins near something a boss has
never had before
it decides being a teleporters a
terrible idea and makes it hasty retreat
back into the base the red Demoman still
watching a sticky trap waiting for the
blue team to come out and push the cart
sure enough they're less and five bots
come out now instantly blown to pieces
after that the red team appears to have
the upper hand however the blue team
user uber and managed to push out of the
spawn they quickly employ the popular
strategy of everyone puts the payload
even though you only need three be able
to push it at max speed and to please be
working well for them as image to
capture the first point with lift to no
trouble but as the rest of the blue team
push the cart the spy has made a
discovery he has never seen such an
object and thus is unsure what to do the
decision is quickly made for him though
as the heavy walks past minigun spinning
and bullets spraying everywhere the spy
moves on with his life and stumbles
across the red team century this he
understands he is quick to SAP it and
the strange red building standing next
to it his joy is short-lived though as
the red pyro sees what's going on ends
despise life the engineer doesn't even
flinch today in the life of a
construction worker eventually the blue
team manages to push past the red team's
in its line of Defense's and makes her
way towards the second point however it
appears the blue team was more of a
threat to themselves in the red team are
as they once again demonstrate a sheer
misunderstanding of fatal drops both
this demo man and scouts think they have
what it takes to face the mountain part
but both fall to a sticky end at this
point the biggest cause of casualties
for the blue team seems to be the clip
as demonstrated by yet another team
member not looking where they are going
the casualty rate for the red team
meanwhile has plummeted due to the lack
of blue team to fight its medic decides
the blue team doesn't lead Anubha the
term drop has never been more
appropriate this demo man also falls off
the cliff
however the cause was more because of
the fact that he was blown off as
opposed to extreme idiocy this soldier
decides he wants to join a medic however
the last second he changed his mind and
cleans on to the side of the cliff for
dear life it attempts to climb up only
make him fall further for a moment it
looks as though he'll do it but at the
last second he slips losing both him and
two friendly medic fall to their doom
despite their lack coordination the blue
team makes progress but it's at this
point that the blue team are taught an
important lesson on how not to push a
cart for one explosion sends the entire
team flying the cliff is still hungry
for victims and claims the life of this
medic the rest of the team are unharmed
except for this demo we land safely but
jump skiers get anyway after this
obvious setback the blue team regroup
and continue to push the bomb to the
enemy base they managed to succeed in
their efforts but once again they fail
to look where they're going and they
only win because of the medic who for
once hasn't walked up the cliff we now
return to our first location dustbowl
after their recent victory the blue team
has decided to take a victory break the
sniper unfortunately is not interested
and attempts to leave however spawned
organizing his privilege and remained
shut the team's engineer decides now is
the time to put his teleporter entrance
and he swiftly does so but afterwards he
appears to be confused about something
they constantly Rams his face into this
chain-link fence
try as he might though he is unable to
return to the first area back inside the
blue base this spires discovered
something incredible located it in this
very corner what it is only he knows for
it exists only in his thoughtless mind
the alarm sounds signalling the
beginning of the fight and it snaps the
spy back to his senses
leaving him Dazed and Confused the fight
goes well for the blue team they seem
capture the first control point but
unfortunately for them their engineer's
diglettz tinkly pacifistic attitude
towards this battle one can only assume
he is making a stand against the ways of
war either that or he is just upset over
the fact that he wasn't allowed spurred
essentially in the first area meanwhile
with the red team has been assembling a
defensive last and they have decided
that standing four soldiers in a row is
the best strategy it may not be the best
way to defend a control point but no one
is going to take this wrong
especially not with the help of a
friendly medic to help them out the red
team has also employed the help of some
engineer's we have in turn built an
elaborate century nest as experts in
their field they know to get the best
efficiency out of centuries you have to
build them as close to each other as
possible
whilst being fed by a dispenser these
sentries will never be destroyed in
battle but as intelligent as these
engineers may seem there is always a
flaw in the bots strategy in this case
the engineers appear to have developed a
fascination with their teleporter for
every couple of seconds they seem to
remember its existence and have a race
to see you can get there first
the winner of course is teleported
straight back to the nest the loser
however has to walk all the way back
this continues indefinitely and for all
we know they could still be there today
but we do know one thing and that is
that the blue engineer is still standing
there still resisting the war going on
before his very eyes he has gained a
follower in this heavy but the heavy
soon grows bored and returns to battle
leaving the engineer alone making his
albums worthless
for our final location we head over to
courts sawmill the bots II have been
fighting over this location for years
but for some reason they find it
difficult to survive in its hazardous
environment nonetheless they attempt
once again to catch the control point
and it appears for once the blue team
has succeeded unfortunately all good
things must come to an end as his medic
discovers as he watches all three of his
heal targets run blindly into the side
of the source if he could feel emotions
he would definitely feel sadness the
medic searches for a new target to heal
he comes across this demo man after his
failure to keep his last patient alive
he immediately pops uber to try and save
him from the soul unfortunately schnapps
enough and the demo man is cut into the
medaka so distraught that he doesn't
realize the thought has saved him from a
pyro instead he panics and walks
backwards into it ending his own life
over on the red team the soldierin
medica pit is skiving from duty instead
of fighting they stand on the outskirts
of battle waiting for it to be over
however the fighters instead brought to
them as they are discovered by the blue
team in a moment of panic the medic pops
dooba to save his own life this seems to
reinvigorate their courage and they run
into the fray but sadly just like the
rest of their team they fail to look
where they're going and they are both
killed our journey is almost over but
there is one more thing we need to
address for the petitioning of the
engineer and dust bolt has paid off and
he has persuaded his team that fighting
is not the answer because of this they
have congregated in this corner to
demonstrate how they feel the red team
meanwhile are just confused as to why
they aren't being attacked nevertheless
they are happy for the rest fight for
once the Badlands are peaceful no
fighting will occur here today no one
knows how long this peace will last but
for all we know it could mean the
beginning of a new day for BOTS
everywhere

Who is ever going to marry her?
Have you seen the colour of her skin?
Ewww she is so dark
She won't be able to be seen in the dark
Dark skin, Dark skin,Dark skin
Anku!
I have really good news! The boys' family is coming to see you
I don't want to see any boy 
At least listen to me ... meet them just once 
The boy is very nice and he also earns very well
He's a well-behaved boy from a good family
Are you even listening to me?
No, I don't want to listen 
Four boys have already rejected me, FOUR!
Do you have any idea how bad I feel?
It breaks me, mom 
It hurts my soul
I know everything... what you think
You think I don't know?
It's all my fault
Everyone told me not to marry your father 
He's very dark and so your kids will also be born dark-skinned
But I was in love 
Now you have to suffer because of it
Your dad has gone to heaven now...and left us to deal with this
But if we are in this situation now we have to deal with it and you have to eventually get married
What do I tell everyone? My daughter does not want to get married?
Mom, Please stop crying
I'll meet the boys family

The Ottoman Empire attempted to besiege Constantinople
and end the Byzantine Empire on a half-dozen occasions.
But these sieges were interrupted by the Crusades, civil wars, rebellions and the invasion of Timur.
However by the middle of the 15th century,
the Ottomans consolidated their territory and finally entered a period of internal stability.
The next siege of Constantinople was imminent.
In 1444, Sultan Murat II defeated the European Crusaders at the Battle of Varna.
The king of Poland and Hungary, Vladislav, was killed during the battle
and that plunged the most powerful states in Central Europe into a crisis.
Still the Ottomans faced resistance from the Albanian Lord Skanderbeg
and the Voivode of Transylvania, John Hunyadi.
The latter sent numerous letters to the Pope and the kings of Europe
calling them to another crusade but since no one was willing,
his activity was limited to raiding into Ottoman territory.
As Skanderbeg was previously an Ottoman vassal, Murad sent three punitive expeditions against him
but all three armies were ambushed and defeated by the outnumbered Albanian forces.
Meanwhile, the Sultan was preoccupied with minor rebellions within the Empire
and a campaign against the Despotate of Morea in 1446.
During the campaign in Greece, Murat forced the ruler of Morea and future Byzantine emperor Constantine XI
to become his vassal and pay tribute.
It was time to attack Skanderbeg and Murad won a minor victory at the Battle of Svetigrad in 1448,
but chasing the guerrilla force under Skanderberg was impossible
and after setting a few garrisons along the frontier, Murad returned to Edirne.
Meanwhile, Hunyadi was preparing another crusade.
By September of 1448, he finally raised a 30,000-strong army and started a new campaign.
He was hoping that the despot of Serbia, Đurađ Branković, would join him
but the latter was an Ottoman vassal and refused, so instead Serbian lands were raided.
Murad knew about all this and started moving his army to prevent Skanderbeg and Hunyadi from joining forces.
Subsequent events are not clear, but it seems that in October,
Hunyadi moved to the field of Kosovo to wait for Skanderbeg.
Some claim that the latter was blocked by Đurađ.
Others think that the local Ottoman garrisons slowed the Albanian force.
But in any case, on the 17th of October,
the Sultan and his 50,000 troops reached the site where the First Battle of Kosovo between Lazar and Murad I took place.
On the first day of the ensuing battle,
Hungarian, Polish, Wallachian and Moldovan forces attacked the Ottomans across the front with their armored troops
but despite early successes, were pushed back.
Hunyadi attempted to use his light cavalry to attack the Ottoman flanks during the night,
but the Ottoman light horsemen intercepted and repelled the crusaders.
On the second day, Murad ordered his flanks to retreat and that tricked Hunyadi.
His troops attacked the Ottoman center head-on and were able to push the Ottoman light infantry back.
However, the Janissaries stopped the Crusader advance near the Sultan's position.
At this point, the Ottoman flanks returned to the battle and encircled Hunyadi's forces.
The leader of the crusading army managed to retreat but more than half of his troops were killed,
while the Ottomans lost around 5,000 men.
The Battle of Kosovo sealed the fate of the Balkan people for the next few centuries.
Skanderbeg continued his resistance and a few more campaigns against him did not bring any tangible success.
But the focus of the Ottomans, the road to Constantinople was now open.
When Murad II passed away and his son Mehmed II came to power in 1451,
his singular goal was to take the Byzantine capital.
Constantinople was not the city it once was.
The total number of the population was now between 50,000 and 100,000
and vast swathes of land within the walls were empty and even used for farming.
The Byzantine emperor Constantine XI
now controlled only a small territory along the coast and had to pay tribute to the Ottoman Sultan.
Mehmed signed treaties with Venice, Genoa and Hungary to ensure that they were not going to attack him.
A new rebellion by the Karamanids allowed him to cross into Anatolia and consolidate his power in the region.
Constantine XI was hoping to end the practice of paying tribute to the Sultan
and threatened to support Mehmed's cousin Orhan in claiming the Ottoman throne.
That gave Mehmed a reason to declare their previous treaty null and void.
The Ottomans started preparing for war.
In April of 1452, the Sultan gave orders to build a fortress called Rumelihisarı
on the northern end of the Bosphorus to prevent any ships from assisting Constantinople from the Black Sea.
The fort was built by the end of August
and Constantine had no other choice but to start bringing his subjects into the city,
storing up supplies and sending pleas for help to the European states.
Only a contingent of Venetian ships and around 1,000 mercenary soldiers
led by Giovanni Giustiniani arrived to help, while most Christian monarchs ignored the pleas.
The Ottomans had more than 100,000 warriors , 69 cannons and 126 ships
under the overall command of Mehmed II
against 7,000 professional Byzantine troops, among them 500 Ottomans of Prince Orhan
and a dozen or so cannons and 26 ships.
More than 30,000 locals were pressed into service.
The Byzantine and Italian ships were better than their counterparts while their guns were outdated.
One of the Ottoman guns was particularly big and would play an iconic role in the upcoming siege.
Each section of the wall would be commanded by one of the Italian commanders
with Giustiniani being the leader.
While Constantine and his Guard were in reserve in the Blachernae Palace.
The defenders repaired the walls and a chain was set across the Golden Horn
to prevent the Ottomans from attacking the walls from the sea.
The vanguard of the Ottoman army arrived at the walls of Constantinople on April 1st, 1453
and began making camp the next day.
The Sultan reached the city on the 5th of April and started preparing to besiege it.
The giant Ottoman cannons were in place on the 6th and started blasting the Theodosian Walls,
but with little effect.
The cannons were so massive they needed three hours to reload
and the Byzantines were able to repair the damage done to the walls.
On the 7th, the Sultan ordered his light infantry and skirmishers to assault the walls,
but the defenders easily repelled the Ottomans.
Unfortunately for them,
their biggest cannons were lost in the accident and their smaller ones were not capable of doing much damage.
The Byzantines attempted a few sallies on the 8th and 9th, but no positive results were achieved.
The Ottomans started battering the city walls on the 11th,
and this bombardment continued until the very end of the siege.
On the 17th and the 18th, the Ottomans attempted night assaults, but the defenders held on.
On the water, the Ottoman fleet was unable to penetrate the chain and move into the Golden Horn.
On the contrary, a few Venetian ships arrived and joined the defenders on the 20th of April.
The Sultan needed to employ a new strategy.
He famously ordered his ships to be moved across land near the Genoese colony of Pera.
The ships were then set to water in the Golden Horn behind the chain on April 28th.
Constantine sent his fire ships to quickly get rid of this threat, but the defenders lost this battle.
From now on, Constantine had to keep at least part of his troops on the northern wall
and that weakened his defenses elsewhere.
Some of the Byzantine cannons were moved into the area,
but they failed to defend the Allied ships which had to return to the harbours.
Their crews joined the defense.
On May 6th, Ottoman cannons managed to destroy the Gates of St. Romanus
and during the night, their forces almost breached the defenses in the area.
But Giustiniani arrived and fended off the attackers.
On the 11th, the Caligarian Gate was damaged and the Ottomans moved in towards the Blachernae Palace
but the Emperor was able to push them back.
The Ottoman Sultan commanded an all-out assault on the 29th.
A massive bombardment was followed by a light infantry assault,
but despite numerical advantage, they failed to take the walls from Giustiniani.
Mehmed's artillery destroyed part of the gates near the Gates of St. Romanus
and 3,000 Janissaries were sent to attack this position.
The Byzantines were able to defend once again,
but the Janissaries took one of the towers and planted the Ottoman flag.
At this point, Giustiniani was heavily wounded and carried away from the battlements.
This was a massive blow to the morale of the defenders
and when a few hundred Janissaries entered the city near the Gates of St. Romanus,
the Byzantine defenses fell.
Citizens and defenders attempted to board the ships and leave the city.
Sources say that the Emperor and his last guards attempted a desperate counterattack near the Gates of St. Romanus,
but he was killed.
Thus the last Roman Emperor died alongside his empire.
The Fall of Constantinople was the event that marked the end of the Medieval Era,
sparked the next phase of the Renaissance,
started the Ages of Discovery and colonization and also centuries of wars between
the European powers and the Ottoman Empire, the wars that we are planning to cover in the future.

I got a safe roof over our head for now
until we find an apartment and just you
know making sure I took every necessary
step to make sure that you know this one
gets like the life that I never had New
York the city of Big Dreams for many is
also home to a growing number of
unhoused people but it's real easy to be
homeless these days over 650,000 people
are homeless in the US more than ever
before the situation is especially bad
in New
[Music]
York and so this is where I
live John lives with his family in a
homeless shelter in New York he shares
this room in Brooklyn with his
girlfriend Zoe and their daughter
Isabella I'll be the
entryway this is basically my
kitchen that's the fridge that they
provide in the unit and they also
provide a little
table and then they give you a
dresser and a
bed as you can
see it's been a year since they moved in
here they're working hard to be able to
move into their own place as soon as
[Music]
possible right now we're trying to get
help getting an apartment but it's
taking a little while now because the
public assistance is backed up with a
bunch of cases so right now we're just
waiting to get help that we need John
was kicked out of his family home when
he was 21 he stayed with friends for a
while while before landing in a homeless
shelter he then got a flat but ended up
in a shelter again after he couldn't
afford the rent we had to do like a few
hurdles um it took us like three tries
to get to this shelter so they have
multiple shelters in New York but the
shelters we were sent to before they
they were kind of like not suitable like
for us living in them because at the
time she was pregnant and the conditions
were really like bad I would say it was
um run down areas there was a lack of
security um the space that they provided
was really really small like I say like
shoulder to shoulder like units I'd say
it's like about like 3x3 um this one
that we got to it it was it was like
more convenient for us because it had a
little bit more space homelessness in
New York is at its highest level in
almost 100 years over 990,000 unhoused
New Yorkers are currently sleeping in
the city's homeless shelters about a
third of them are children over the past
10 years the number of homeless adult
New Yorkers has doubled pushing up
demand for shelter places also among
young families my sisters all went
through the shelter system cuz they all
have kids and you know they couldn't
like stay where they were living
couldn't they couldn't live like with my
mom cuz no space there so they had to go
through the shelter too and that's kind
of what made me want to say hey if they
could do it I could do it too John Works
night at a Clinic where he is often
confronted with homelessness more people
are going into the hospital just cuz
they want a bed they want something to
eat and you know the the hospital can't
deny them but it's unfortunate cuz
sometimes I have to like kick them out
cuz that's like a part of my job even
though I don't want to cuz I understand
what it is to be homeless since I
experienced that myself in his teens
John broke the law he was arrested and
sent to prison Zoe whom he met in high
school never gave up on him
I I never thought I was a good person
you know I thought I was just a average
person but you know she she really gets
in my head and she lets me know like hey
you're a strong guy you do everything
you can to do right and it's true she
she made me like she she made me find a
fire in myself that I didn't know I had
until you already had that fire no I I
didn't I didn't have I didn't realize
that I had that fire until she like
helped me acknowledge it and and then
from there it's just been it just keeps
burning stronger and stronger and then
with this one it's like she's asleep now
it's just like a a furnace or something
it's just going to keep burning like you
know no matter what happens to me if I
have health conditions or mental
conditions you know I'm always going to
try to be the rock for them try to be a
a sense of stability that they can
always rely on cuz you know this is this
is my family now so you know I want to
do the best thing to be their protector
and and their provider F and I'm going
to do everything in my power to do
that um I always believed in him um
people used to tell me all the time you
know he's bad for you don't follow him
he's so many things but I should close
my ears to it cuz I believed in him to
this day I believe in him and Rodriguez
also believes in John the lawyer runs a
nonprofit called avenues for justice
which works to keep young people out of
prison and provides young offenders an
alternative to
incarceration anel is very troubled by
the changes he's
seen it's real easy to be homeless these
days um because of the economic issue I
mean look this neighborhood there was a
time even for me where the landlord
didn't give me heat I look around the
corner and get a bigger apartment for
less money that was the situation I mean
there wasn't this hustle and this issue
of Statistics in terms of you know how
much apartments are costing we weren't
looking at a lot of that but today the
issue is out of control where there is
no housing um for even people who who
want them and need them uh the
apartments that I used to rent were $200
the same apartment today is
$4,000 same apartment the covid-19
pandemic made things worse according to
a survey by cuni around 44% of New
Yorkers had problems paying their rent
at the outset of the pandemic leading to
numerous evictions job termination
domestic violence mental illness and
addiction are other reasons why people
end up on the streets Andel has been
helping young people facing such
challenges for 50 years I always say
that I'm a court advocacy program um I I
don't really deal in homelessness
however this work takes me in into
everywhere including the issue of
homelessness because I'm representing a
lot of young people um who in 2023 or
since the pandemic even before that L
these kids are on their own problems at
home
um uh problems that they create for
themselves sometimes that create
situations where they can't go home the
center aims to offer young people a safe
space
they can do their homework here have
lunch or learn how to improve their CV
for example they also have access to
counselors who can serve as positive
role models one of them is Elsie who
first came to the nonprofit many years
ago to join its
program at the age of 13 I started to
sell drugs um all the way up to about 16
and a half and at 16 I was arrested
three times and at the same time I found
out I was pregnant so that just fli my
whole life around in many different
places where the program came in play to
help me do that exactly which is put me
back in school um you know get me a
place I was living with my mom at the
time in a studio apartment um just to
prepare myself for being a young mother
um I was 16 I had no idea what I was
getting myself into um between becoming
a young mother and Fa State Prison time
um I think those are two barriers that I
probably won't want to wish on
anybody now Elsie is helping
others today she's dealing with a
client's case in
Conneticut hey how are you um to my
understanding he had a court appearance
today
correct yes correct
and the outcome was
we um to my understanding if he was
being released mom had to be there
correct no
no um I want you know follow up on the
on the status because if we do need to
go up there we just need the heads
up okay appreciate you all right thank
you okay you to
bye yep they want to know nothing until
tomorrow that's another state New York
and Connecticut runs very
different you cannot possibly do this
job if you just coming in here just do a
job and go home this job has more to do
with it mentally we we are fighting
against a system that clearly is not
fair for minorities so it it's like a
balance that is just not fair right home
supposed to be the safe place and safe
home is not safe for most of these kids
who come here
unfortunately um and from that I was
like wow you know like I got to get it
together um because I would have been
crying all the time you know most of our
kids don't get a good deal like we will
hope um you know because we up against a
system that the law comes in play LC
doesn't just work at the nonprofit
thanks to donations she is also studying
at NYU the biggest private university in
the states considering her past her
journey was anything but a
given well my you know between my trauma
that I've been through um between being
in a criminal justice system homeless a
dxic violence
Survivor I will tell my young self that
it's not my
fault um that I am loved there's people
that do care for me um and you can do
anything that you put your mind into um
I think confidence is a very key point
to these kids who go through or being in
the shelter because for some kids is
embarrassed
um and just to make them feel that they
worthy Elsie has managed to come a long
way John and Zoe also hope to be able to
stand on their own two feet soon in
spite of everything they're staying
optimistic ever since she was born I
feel like time has just been flying like
I feel like a month goes by and a week
mhm you know there's no time to think
just everything is just happening at the
same time before I know it we're going
to be all living in our apartment with
our three
cats I've done the most that I've ever
done in my entire life when it comes to
like trying to be
responsible being on top of everything
getting everything that we need together
you know all the paperwork all the
information having to renew stuff it's
it's just been a lot like you know I
feel like I'm I'm pooped I'm ready to go
to sleep and not wake up till next
year

what's it like in germany
must be terrible well they asked for it
they got it
yes but you can't let them starve i
don't know about that
i got a sun out there as far as i can
see it'd be a good thing if some of them
did die
well a lot of germany is dead
our last bombing was directed against
their communications
against convoys trains road and rail
bridges
against good yards stations fire ducks
we not only smashed up the towns but
smashed up the links between the towns
and at the finish life in germany just
ran down
like a clock place and time meant
nothing
because the people the links between the
people were smashed too
they were just left wandering searching
looking for food looking for their homes
looking for each other
friday
there are 70 million people in germany
and about 30 million of them
are looking for someone or are lost and
lie looking without seeing like the eyes
of a dead rabbit
they are still stunned by what hit them
stunned by the war
they started but in the search for food
and the urge to get home the life force
is beginning to stir again
today our powers of destruction are
terrifying
but the will to live is still stronger
that's why we can't wash our hands of
the germans
because we can't afford to let that new
life flow in any direction it wants
our military government that is your
husbands and sons
have to prod the germans into putting
their house in order
why we have an interest in germany that
is purely selfish
we cannot live next to a disease-ridden
neighbor
and we must prevent not only starvation
and epidemics but
also diseases of the mind new brands of
fascism
from springing up what is more
we have to persuade the germans to do
this themselves
first of all the material patching up
and where in the meantime do they live
so
yes all looks lifeless
but underneath the rubble
there are people living
living in the cellars
the smoke from the cooking stoves drips
up from the ruins to the open third
story where
people are living too
many in the big towns living without
light
without coal without water
without soap living in the stench of
corpses and sewerage
still with the will to live
but the one thing on which all
reconstruction depends
is coal without coal there can be no
power and no transport
in essen our coal control has taken over
the crop family mansion
as its headquarters and from here
we organize the output and distribution
from the whole
ruer coalfields
last summer what was called operation
coal scuttle
brought 30 000 miners back from the
vermont
but today the great problem is moving
the coal from the pit head
to the liberated countries to the german
power plants
and to the allied military dumps
for the germans themselves there is no
coal they must go out in the woods and
parks to cut wood
to strip the bark off the trees to
collect brushwood and carry it home
in handcarts and prams
we say the great problem
but in germany today for military
government officers
there is no such thing as a single
problem
for example the liberated countries
won't get this coal unless there is
transport to carry it
the transport cannot move any distance
unless the tracks and the bridges have
been repaired
they can't be repaired without steel and
the steel cannot be made without coal
there are some 17 newspapers published
in the british zone
they all carry advertisements asking for
the whereabouts of relatives
at hamburg there is a british run postal
search station
indexing inquiries coming in at the rate
of 50 000
a day but when someone contacts their
relatives
they must get a permit before they can
travel by train
hordes of cyclists and pedestrians and
horse-drawn trucks wait
across the pontoon and bailey bridges
built by our engineers
wait to cross after a military
government threat
and all this has to be supervised by our
sergeants
and our peace
foreign
is
is about to leave
so
um
but in all this we have to safeguard
ourselves
first of all from crime and disorder
so military government courts are set up
with british judges
these courts are public there is an
interpreter
a german defense counsel and a british
prosecutor
then the german police force is being
remade
the new german policeman has to
understand that he is the servant of the
public
and not its master
then we have to safeguard ourselves and
disease
the germans are getting 1 000 to 1200
calories a day
according to type of work about half our
rations
but we have a survey team in the field
staffed by the red cross and the ramc
checking the effect of these rations on
the population
tests are made of blood content of blood
pressure
of height and weight and reports sent to
the control commission for them to judge
whether the food is just sufficient to
keep germany at work
but the greatest headache is education
you will never get nazi ideas out of the
heads of some of the adults
particularly those living away from the
devastated areas
what about the children for them the
desolated landscape provides a dream
playground the derelict weapons of war
might have been specially designed to
have games with
there are germans who know this can't go
on
the teachers must be found and
themselves taught to teach the children
that there are other things in life
beyond nazism
and war but again
the complexity of problems
the schools are in ruins the teachers
too few
the children too many and as the months
go by
the children are growing up and getting
more like their fathers
we just cannot afford to leave them to
stew in their own juice
today berlin has still the aspect of a
battlefield
reichstag the seat of past german
governments has been
gutted the crop family
who with the other german industrialists
first backed hitler
and then produced the weapons for world
domination have been scattered
and arrested this family armed germany
in the franco-prussian war
they made big bertha in the first
submarine for the kaiser in world war
one
they are just as responsible for killing
allied soldiers as hitler
and guri and by killing
they grew rich this time
their war plants have been left a mess
of twisted girders
look
this time the vermouth are rarely beaten
to the wire cages all over germany the
master race of men
are slubbering along they are stripped
of their insignia
numbered but this mass of humanity has
to be sorted out into something like
order
not only their bodies but also their
minds
what about the ideas in their heads
they have to be demobilized and got back
to work
but let one man or woman who still
believes in the nazi regime or the
destiny of the german people to rule the
world
take office and you have the beginnings
of another war
so they are put through a screen to
begin with
selected germans interrogate them and
fill in their demobilization papers
note this meek little man who looks like
a clerk or a grocer
here is his portrait in luftwaffe
uniform
then all their thumbprints are taken for
record and they are stripped and
examined for the ss
mark tattooed under the left armpit then
their past history and character is
examined by our intelligence officers
german-speaking ex-commandos and
parachutists
the majority of germans get through this
close examination
and are demobilized but
every so often there appears one who is
suspect
or who is wanted whose papers are too
good
or whose answers are not good enough
rejected back to the cage
as night falls in germany the people
must remember the curfew
those without homes or caught on the
street disappeared into the air raid
shelters
then the air-raid siren wails again to
remind them
that they lost the war of their own
making
to remind them that it is up to them to
regain their self-respect as a nation
and to learn to live in a friendly
manner with their neighbors
to remind them that much as we hate it
we shall stay in germany until we have
real guarantees that the next generation
will grow up a sane
and christian people a germany of light
and life and freedom a germany that
respects truth
and tolerance and justice
now gentlemen you'll raise your right
hands
and take the earth with me
i swear by almighty god
that i will at all times
germany
me
to establish equal justice under the law
for all persons
um
so help me god so why are me a god
helper
you

BBC I have few questions to ask you
which I have at hand here I will be
picking from here and if you can answer
these questions this should be that you
have record or evidence
BBC did anybody give you the evidence of
a picture or video clip of a rape or
oppression or attack or be maltreated
among all the people you interviewed no
a few days ago BBC released a three part
documentary exposing Prophet TB Joshua
on allegations of rape and a lot of
things occultism and a lot of other
things now according to the BBC this is
what they wrote at the end of the
documentary the BBC contacted the church
leadership with the allegations in this
film they replied that making unfounded
allegations against Prophet TB Joshua is
not a new occurrence
none of the allegations was ever
substantiated this was the reply that
the church me leadership gave to the BBC
now they said that they did not respond
to the details of the allegations now
this is not the first time that Prophet
Joshua has been accused of something or
has been exposed or something like that
as far back as 2001 there were articles
about Prophet Joshua and even in 200
bisa one of the women who spoke in um in
the documentary she tried to expose
Prophet TI Joshua when I posted the
video of the expose a lot of people in
the comment section were asking that why
did they wait for him to die then after
three years now that they are bringing
out this video well this is not the
first time that Prophet TB josua has
been accused of something like this it's
not the second time not the third time
now the church did not respond but then
his sons some of the people that he
trained they have come out with response
to BBC asking BBC certain questions and
throwing certain facts and figures at
BBC I have the food just for you I'm the
Headless you there headless
reactions now the first person to
respond was prophet IO Samuel now this
man if you look at his hairstyle in his
beard and you look at prophet
you know that yes like father like son
like you know that like father like son
now this man Prophet IO Samuel is the
head pastor of Shilo World Chapel in
Nigeria and he has made a video asking
BBC certain questions
BBC did anybody give you the evidence of
a picture or video clip of a rape or
operation or attack or being maltreated
among all the people you interviewed no
is any one of them still in synagogue
today no did they live synagogue more
than 10 15 years ago yes we are the
people that always stay with man of God
and the ones that stayed with him till
the end of his life on Earth unto Glory
they enjoyed life I want to ask you BBC
if these people were maltreated for
example close
that the last baby in the family of
prophet Chris the family of Tong husband
and wife that live with the entire
family in
synagogue they just left after the time
God took man of God unto Glory they were
still there the sister the elder sister
married the second man to Prophet TI
Joshua the second man called Rin all of
them went to London they have Ministries
if they were oppressed
why would the family be giving the
charity funds to be going around the
world to do charity and report back to
synagogue until Daddy went onto Glory
this family lived in synagogue if they
were being oppressed remember these are
British people that you can interview
you never interviewed the the parents
and the last baby was claiming that she
was being oppressed go and do researches
this lady was one of the ministers that
discipled and began to preach they were
being treated as royal family from
Britain Chris if the brother Chris
became a prophet and Prophet Tibi Joshua
is a fake man of God or evil how did CHR
become a known prophet in London till
today in UK verify I want you to also
verify who is bisa what is our mission
why this clip at the glory time that of
God is resting why this clip after 3
years why did no one report to
authorities of Nigeria or International
Security people like DSS or FBI or efcc
or police there was no record like that
BBC go to your archive where you not the
one that interview Prophet TI Joshua and
made the whole world to know about him
is on the news we have the record
why today people are now telling you the
wrong things guide your steps trace your
steps search for the truth I am not here
to defend Prophet TI Joshua as a perfect
man I am here to talk about the man of
Grace he works towards perversion but he
not perfect all the men of God in
Nigeria and Africa in the world today if
they can walk like him in charity in
love in humility in prayer life
isolation life in prayers silence
without responding to all these people
for
once devil will check out of this world
for us another person who has reacted to
the BBC expose of prophet Joshua is
white man Harry now this man is also you
know a son of prophet Joshua he is the
head of the Squan um thessalonica in
Greece That's The Synagogue Church of
all nations in thessalonica Greece
that's where he heads and he too has
made a video and in his video he's also
asking questions he is wondering say one
of the ladies they know her as Rachel
Holmes but in the video she she's going
by a different name saying that she she
was
lesbian I'm not here to accuse anybody
or to condemn any
anybody the Judgment Belongs to the Lord
Almighty on the last day everybody will
give his
account just to take little out of what
I
saw in the BBC
documentary the first person who
spoke was Rachel
Holmes
which her name now is Ry I don't know
maybe she changed her name we knew her
as a Rachel those days and the first
thing she started saying she said I'm a
gay I'm a
lesbian I stand for this I have always
been I never change I thought if I go
to schan I will change but I never
change that was the first things he
started by saying and some other people
who
spoke everybody came with their own
problems some was this some was that we
don't want to begin to mention the past
of of every
person because everybody has a past
before we come to know the truth of
Jesus
Christ and receive our
salvation but you can understand
people who failed to make it in life
people who failed to
succeed as true disciples as true
genuine Christians
are the ones who eventually got
frustrated gang up
together and come out with
this false
stories trying to tell the world why
they themselves failed in life he was
also asking that if all these people
were indeed being tortured and raped and
all that as they claimed that they were
why did they stayed there for 10 years
15 years and all that now if somebody is
doing something as bad as this to you
why won't you just walk away or go away
why are you there for 10 years 15 years
20 years but my question also
is if all these bad things were
happening to them how come one of them
stay there for 14 years another one stay
there for 17 years another one stay
there for 20 years another one stay
there for 15 years
how
come a person who is well with his
senses will not want to stay in a place
where they rap him who wants to stay
where they rap you you want to go you
want to run away you want to
escape so this is a pure lie he also
threw a person at one of the men a
prophet ago he was this man he was very
close to Prophet Joshua if you watch
Emmanuel TV you will see him on the show
every single day now they were asking
said if this man is claiming that
Prophet josua was fake does that mean
the Miracles that he the man Prophet the
things he was doing when he was with t
Joshua all the Miracles does that mean
they are also fake does that mean all
this why that Prophet Joshua is going
around from country to Country going for
Crusade and healing millions of people
was that also fake
or another one who
said The Miracles were
fake if the Miracles were fake what were
you doing in that Ministry for the past
20
years what were you doing when you
became yourself a junior Prophet I'm
talking about
ago he became a junior
prophet and he experienced himself the
power of God he stretched forth his hand
and many people got healed he God
delivered God blessed God used him the
power of God passed through him to heal
to save to bless was those Miracles also
fake the time God using were using him
was those Miracles were also
fake and if he says it was fake was all
the Miracles Prophet I josha went for
Crusades all over the world in the
presence of hundreds of thousands of
people and millions watching live were
those Miracles also
fake you can deceive one man you can
deceive two people you can deceive three
people with tricks but you cannot
deceive Millions you cannot deceive a
whole
stadium the testimonies of those who
were healed blessed delivered those
whose lives were changed are millions
all over the world and they still stand
he also said that when BBC released the
documentary fresh if you go to the
comment section you see a lot of people
trying to debank the allegation saying
that oh no Prophet Joshua is good I
really received healing I have already
received healing and all that but now if
you go there the BBC has deleted all
those good comments about Prophet C
Joshua and you will see only bad
comments these are his words another
thing that was very strange to me was
that when the BBC documentary came
out I read the comments all the comments
down they were positive speaking good
things people were coming out to write
testimonies that no I don't believe this
documentary this is not true I
personally receive a healing from
Prophet Joshua I personally receive a
blessing I receive Deliverance I receive
a prophecy my life changed since I went
to scan many people wrote
testimonies and I told told to one of
you I said to one of you don't be
surprised if within few days you will
see all the positive messages start
disappearing from the BBC comment
section and you will start seeing only
negative
[Music]
comments and the person said no it is
not possible it it will show it will
prove that they are doing something you
know because we all all of us we we read
the positive comments I dare you go and
read the comment sections on the BBC
Africa documentary now you will see a
lot of
negative
[Music]
comments maybe one positive the one that
they forgot most of them they remove
already and they ban those accounts they
ban them not to send more positive
comments we which really
exposes the hidden
agenda of BBC Africa there are a lot to
be said about these questions that they
are throwing at the BBC if you watch the
documentary part one part two part three
you will see that they showed a part
where the people were trying to escape
Prophet Joshua saying that he was um
trying to kill them
name the fames were light too he bought
the whole system
how do you stand up to a man who has got
a list of presidents in his pocket just
continue to watch Emmanuel he TV josua
preaches forgiveness he doesn't
forgive they shut at the back of
the he sent them to kill
me to kill
me everywhere I turn
to was like w this man had p had police
generals and all that coming to his
church so you that you are being abused
over there allegedly who are you going
to report to now these are some of the
things that were in the documentary I'll
suggest you watch the documentary part
one two and three after that you will
get all your answers but then these are
the questions that the sons of prophet
TI Joshua are throwing at BBC if you
have the answers let me know in the
comment section whether the BBC will
reply or not we are here for the

Maori = 'He ao! He ao! Aotea! Aotearoa'
Its land, its land, its land through a long white cloud.
Māori come from a place called Hawaiki. 
 Our homeland to the northeast of here.
And it's where our first descendant by the
name of Kupe came from.
When Kupe and his entourage or his
as people arrived they saw this grassy
land or hills popping out through what
looked like a long white cloud.
Aotearoa
So that's the very first name of
New Zealand.

Haka is a dance of a noble people.
Haka is an identity of Maori.
There are many different types of Haka. 
 There is the expressive haka which displays
anger.
Anger about the subject that we're
doing the haka about.
there's also other
Haka which talk about the histories of
the land.
Histories of different ancestors.
Battles of different ancestors
and Haka is an expressive
It's an expressive way for Maori to be able
to tell their story.
tell their story and let it all out.
Haka today has become a brand almost.
Before it only identified to Māori.
but now it identifies to New Zealand
The beauty of Haka is that you can design it specifically so that it suits you and
where you are.
And through a massive brand
like the All Blacks other teams have
picked it up and then you know schools
and kindergartens and what that's lead
onto as a learning of the language one
or two words at a time and now most
people would be able to translate the
haka word-for-word and they might know
another Haka or their school Haka and
that's more learning that goes with it
and so because of the beauty of haka and
everybody wanted to be a part of it.
I think that has helped to integrate it
into New Zealand society
So the Haka to me it means a part of
my cultural identity it is a part of my
customs my traditions and it was an
important ceremonial dance that was
passed down from my ancestors and we
still practice it today.
This is what I love.
I love being able to show my
culture off to the world it's the only
job in in the world we get to poke your
tongue out it your customers and you get
paid for it.
That's a good reason to do it.
very very proud actually to be able to
share our culture to the world and
people like yourself embraces it.
Embrace our culture and they
love it.
And do you think you can do this your entire life?
I'll keep on doing
it as long as I can as long as I can
stamp my feet and do the haka I'll keep
doing it
This is the Waitangi Treaty Grounds. New
Zealand's most historic place.
This is where on the 6th of February 1840 a treaty document was signed between the Māori people
my ancestors and the
British representatives.
We were the minority when these brash young European
or British sailors were coming in after
spending years out of out on sea and
then coming in coming into our countries
They mistreated our people. They mis
treated our woman. They mistreated
our children. They murdered our men. They murdered our kids for no reason
No reason whatsoever other than they've felt that they had the superiority over us.
we fought to
the bitter end
and it was because of the vision of our
many prophets, our many visionaries
that we had pre 1840 that foresaw this
happening was the very reason that they
wanted this treaty document this treaty
document came about as a request from
Maori so that we were able to move
forward as one people as one nation
Ta Moko is it's an identity print of
our people it tells the history the
genealogies and the stories of you as an
individual who wears the Ta Moko.
in short it's a tattoo but it tells your
whole story because prior to the pen and
paper our body was the paper the ink was
the pin.
the reason the old people had Moko
was to identify who they were it was to
also identify what they did where they
the standing in their tribe was.
Status you know, things like that.
And that's what it's still about and it's still about
identity the main part of it is all
about identity.
The client will come
in will we'll have a conversation and
from that conversation and then look
into our minds because
in our minds you know we have all the designs.
and then we utilize the right design to
get that story sort of understood on the
skin.
We do not draw the design before the client comes
For us it's best that
it comes directly after the conversation
because that's when you're at your freshest.
that's what makes it so unique.
Like today I had a idea in mind but then as
soon as I saw her back it changed just like that.
It looks totally different to
what I was going to initially do.
In the old days they utilize the
bone chisel. The chisel was actually you
know tapped on the face to split the skin
like cut the skin.
And if we take a look
behind me on this photograph here this
is one of our Māori kings his name was Tafia.
And if you can see like
the incisions were made on the skin so
you can actually see it was cut where I
was on my face the lines are like
drawing.
Yeah but these guys did it
the hard way.
British wanted Maori to cede all of our
rights and our sovereignty and ownership
over to the British.
Henry Williams who
translated the document from English
into the native tongue Te Reo Maori knew
full well that Maori would never ever
agree to those terms as set out in the
English Treaty documents.
he translated it in a
way whereby Maori would understand and
whereby Maori would agree to the terms
as set out in the Maori document.
From 1840 to today in fact it has always been
a contentious point of discussion
We arrived here from the Pacific and in the
Pacific they practice tattooing.
So we would have brought those skills here.
And then our designs changed as we arrived here because of our environment.
So the design of my tattoo is based on my 'iwi' (Tribe)
The 'awa' (river). The Whanganui awa (river).
And the design is that the ropes of the tide is coming into the rope that tie
all the different iwi (tribes) down the river together.
Beautiful. Did you knew when you came in here this morning how it would look like?
Not exactly.
I gave him free free will to do what he
wanted to do yeah. I trust in his design.
And you're very happy with it?
I love it.
Your Mãori as well.
yes
Are you hundred percent? Or how does it work?
I'm not sure on percentages but
My Whakapapa (genealogy) tells the story.
My mother is 'Pākehā' or English.
And my father is Māori.
And through him we go up.
So yeah.
I'm of Te Āti Awa, Tuwharetoa,
and Te Ati Ruanui iwi (tribes)
Oke. Cool!
So not everyone can get it a tattoo as you have because you're part of a tribe.
Can I get a similar tattoo?
You can get some a similar tattoo to my
understanding.
That's called 'Kirituhi' (non-maori) I think.
So it's the same sort of design, but not with the Whakapapa (genealogy), but your own story.
People that are outside of my tribe
they'll just see me as a Moko face but my
tribe knows what it means because I've
explained it to them and it's about my
guardian it's about a spiritual guardian
because we're big believers on that stuff
That we have tribal spiritual
guardians and that's what mine represents.
Nature is our everything
And when I talk
nature I talk the 'whenua' (lands)
I talk 'rākau' (the trees), the 'ngahengahe' (the forests).
I talk the 'moana' (lakes). Everything that's in the 'moana'.
that is our nature that is our world
everything has a lifeforce everything
has a heartbeat to Māori.
and we treat it with such respect.
and that is our
cultural upbringing that is our upbringing
and it's a part of our 'tikanga' (custom).   
Our practices of we as Maori.
To be respectful to everything around us
Swimming in our 'awa' our river.
knowing that we're swimming in the
ancestral waters that our ancestors also
swam in.
'Wairua' (spirit) that spirituality of
our ancestor also cleanses us.
it cleanses us physically. It cleanses usmentally and it also cleanses us
spiritually.
'Te Reo' is the language simply translated.
It's the language of our people.
if our language dies
Our people die, our culture dies.
Without language we don't have an identity I believe.
You know everybody has an
identity as a Kiwi with the English language.
because that's what we're known
for apart from Haka.
But as Maori within our
own country we need that.
'Te Reo' goes way back to Hawaïki.
Te Reo was kept
alive through the traditional types of
songs that we sang. The haka.
We told our stories, histories and genealogies
through our 'whakairo' (carving) through our carvings and our meeting houses.
And so that's how we we communicated with one another.
It was our missionary brothers and sisters
that come over you know from
Great Britain from Europe and started to
record the language on paper.
Through the
diligence of people like Williams and
other dictionary writers hopefully with
the help of Maori that they recorded as
many words as they could and that's how
it become a written language.
And they used the alphabet of the English language to write the Maori language.
That's correct. Yes.
My grandparents were a part of that forbidden generation that weren't allowed to speak
the language and that came
down to ignorance from the non Māori
That were around at the time who felt threatened by the language because
they couldn't understand what our people
were saying.
They tried to outlaw in fact they did.
They passed a law that forbid
Maori to speak the native tongue and if
they did speak the native tongue they
were strapped for speaking the language
because of that ignorance it caused the
whole language to miss an entire
generation which was my parents
generation but in the past you know I
In the past I would say past 20 years a lot of work
has been done to revive 'Te Reo'.
We've got universities now providing Maori
language courses to help with the
revival of 'Te Reo' Maori.
Where things Maori
will push down then they re-emerging.
but their e-emerging with not only help. They re-emerging with funding
And they're e-emerging with love because our
politicians can look back and say okay
that was wrong we can't fix it from there.
But what can we do for now to help and
enhance this person's educational
experience and to help them get on their
way and to learn what they need to learn
yeah.
You know the acceptance of 'Te Reo' Maori
is starten to broaden and starting to
widen around our country and that's very
very encouraging I think.
it's good to hear that
If I see your Maori heart you might get a facial tattoo.

double children for me
once upon a time before say October 9th
there was a food bridge where people
used to go about their daily activity
and businesses but precisely night of
October got collapse got washed away by
the flood and the big grasses not just
the wooden bridge every other part is
messed up you know it's matched up
inside the offices the bar The Guest
House Everywhere is gone down so
business has been really difficult for
us but yes we need to move on the same
one go and get stopped the top gets
going so we're left with no other means
to go about in our activity and then
people were stranded so we have to
create an alternative means for them to
go about the activities by introducing
the boats instead of those smaller
wooden candles because those ones are
not safe you know so with this now
people are happy and they are still
going about their activity meaning that
we are still in business but not as as
it seems to be business as been bad a
little bit yeah because it's not
everybody that's comfortable using the
boat the people that normally give us
those little tokens they packed away
because of as a result of the flood
so in that way it affects me very well
but I'm only happy that the two one that
remains they are able to cope up for the
situation of the flood really we are not
making water it definitely will make
money

so yeah welcome to the channel and as
you know the trending thing right now is
TV Joshua's documentary and if you know
well he had other prophets who with no
aot of guil conscience or anything will
just defend him or go straight to the
point and defend him at all cost this
being the likes of Love bushiri Java the
man himself you Angel among others now
he recently was mocking T J that was
Angel now it's TI Joshua well in today's
video the sons are beginning to speak
and this is just getting more and more
interesting now before that Apostle Aros
to has been trending for a prophecy he
gave before this whole thing started so
let's begin with that the manifestation
of God that is going to be seen in the
church is
that
called
judgment let me read to us his very
words it a judgment of all
forms will be meted out on falsehood in
the house of
God all forms of infiltration in the
body of
Christ in terms of deceptions and
coverups will be
exposed so I'm saying that in the from
the next few weeks we're in January
before January
ends you will start hearing
news of several coverups that they have
people in church have
successfully done for several years that
will explode just watch
it the reason why this is happening is
because there is a new era that God has
initiated and the first impact the first
recipient of this new policy that heaven
has decided to
adopt is going to
be in the house of God so following this
is the prophet Sheed bushu who came out
with a long line of statements and this
is what he actually
[Music]
said so this was his defense he still
loves and cherishes his legacy and a
whole lot of things moving on his
Prophet lovey who did a whole video just
to address the situation and and in this
he asked many questions one of them
being what they will gain from this
documentary since the man himself is
dead and if you don't know Prophet L
believes he is meant to continue on the
works of T Joshua so if something like
this is hitting TV Joshua is definitely
going to affect him in one way or the
other so let's listen to what he had to
say too now you need to ask
yourself what is the
motive of making a video video or making
a documentary about a man who can't
defend himself that is the first red
flag anyone that has any kind of
wisdom the primary thing is always to
make sure you don't go with one side of
the
story now when the man was alive I
remember this when the man was alive
there were people who were paid to frame
him on stories if they've paid people to
frame me create stories about me and I'm
not where lifted as this man uh was in
his day God is taking me somewhere I
haven't arrived there yet but if they
could pay people to create stories about
me if they could do things to frame
me how much more for a man who took over
Africa for Christ took over the world
for Christ so the number one thing is
you have to ask yourself I'm not here to
give you uh my opinion I'm here to ask
you questions that you need to question
yourself with the first thing is why are
you going to create something that a man
is not alive to defend himself why
didn't they make this documentary when
he was
alive that is the first
issue number
two how can we
verify that the people on the on on on
the
documentary what they are saying is
completely the truth how can that be
verified there is no evidence other than
their words right now maybe he did do
them wrong maybe he didn't do them wrong
whatever the case may be but the
question is
this
how can we
[Music]
verify that what is being said is true
so there is it Prophet PIR has spoken
Prophet L has spoken and yet Java has
not spoken because I guess he's in a
fasting mood right now and he says no
phone policy so I'm sure he's busy with
that same with
who I know once bushiri has
spoken is definitely going to speak on
this issue and maybe in a live video or
something which I may not be able to
post but in case that happens I'll leave
it in the comment section so that you
guys can watch it on whatever Channel it
is on now back to arai who said a lot of
things are going to be exposed this year
beginning this January did he knew this
documentary was coming or is just the
prophecy from God and if that's so
what's next because the last time it was
you Angel recently T J and now T Joshua
the question being who is next

oh my
ah
Oh
there's just so many times where you
question can I keep going and rowing
across the Atlantic Ocean I've been
alone at sea I've never seen another
human for 55 days I learned that over a
billion people didn't have something
that I've always taken for granted and
that's clean safe drinking water I think
people are very surprised in the
beginning when they realized is such a
my store in my background being a young
woman but was an immigrant this
triggered a law that through many
hardships emotionally culturally they
could actually do something like this
yessuh was mainly for kids in the
community and Pearson to have a mentor
to have someone that they can look up to
and you're like I want to be like them

the first time my name was up in lights
I was so amazed by it I spent forever
just staring it I'm passionate about the
world that we live in but I'm also
passionate about telling the different
story I write plays about young kids who
live on estates in an urban culture and
usually stories from those backgrounds
are always negative stories and so in a
sense I am trying to change the world
because I want people to see that they
there were different stories that come
from those environments I knew when I
was younger what I enjoyed I knew I had
a and a passion had a talent I had to
add ambition I think I had a dream to
make a difference my products that I've
created are all really simple and so
it's that simple technology that where
we kind of take a step back and we allow
developing countries to take a step
forward I've got this kind of dream that
I want to continue developing more
products that help people simple
products that you know don't don't have
to be some kind of science genius or
some engineering genius to soul
I don't think I'm ever ever going to get
used to what you see when you go to
India now when you're on the streets and
you see the poverty having emerged as
effectually so much we served up a
quarter of a million hot meal was in
India there are two large areas that are
no longer hungry because of this tiny
little company that I formed in the UK I
was really fortunate that had somebody
who had sparked my interest and who
helped me find my talent and my passion
we think of ourselves like the heroes
the mentors would go there and we
delivering service we're helping others
but through experiences to working with
people through to being with people I
realize is a two-way street they're
changing my life as much as them between
two layers every kid has a time in life
when they questioned their identity and
that's really important to me because I
think that once you figured out who you
are that's when you even chase for your
dreams or you don't y su casa vou la

I've got a voice that I want everyone to
hear what I've got to say because I want
to share it i want to encourage anybody
across the world you to really believe
in themselves as a young person that
they can actually do something to make a

switzerland famous for this mountain
clocks its interesting banking
arrangements and of course its
neutrality whereas in the past it was
primarily known for its mercenary
companies and their ability to wage war
so what exactly changed why did
switzerland go from a land of soldiers
for hire to one of non-involvement and
why did the countries around it which to
understate things really like to fight
their neighbours allowed this to happen
so exactly when switzerland became
neutral is debated in the 16th century
it wasn't a formal nation but loose
confederation of smaller states which
were part of the holy roman empire there
was a scuffle in italy over whether or
not francis the first of france was in
fact the ruler of milan and since the
swiss had a claim to it themselves it
was time to fight the swiss lost and as
a result they pledged themselves to a
perpetual peace with respect to france
but you know who isn't france savoy and
when france marched into northern italy
20 years later the swiss helped
themselves to this land after this
switzerland largely stayed out of wars
barring the supply of mercenaries during
the 30 years war keeping this piece
wasn't out of any desire to maintain
their neutrality but for two reasons the
first was that the states around them
were much larger and getting invaded by
them sucked the second was the
protestant reformation which meant
instead of worrying about events in
italy france or the holy roman empire
they now had to worry about their
neighbours who suddenly believed
different things this internal conflict
managed to keep the swiss occupied until
1798 when its neighbours with shiny new
political ideas invaded the swiss
confederacy fell apart quickly and it
was replaced with the brand new helvetic
republic which was stripped of this
territory napoleon soon changed his mind
and reformed the confederacy well most
of it is a french puppet state but after
he was ousted the victors all had
different plans for switzerland the
french plan for switzerland wasn't heard
since they had just lost the war and so
be quiet the prussians wanted
switzerland to be forced into joining
the german confederation and the
austrians wanted it to become an
austrian puppet state and buffer against
the french in order to avoid any
conflict the russians mediated and
everyone agreed that the swiss
confederation would be forever neutral
and wouldn't send troops abroad except
for the pope that is he could have some
everyone accepted this until the late
19th century when it became a haven for
socialist bonapartist nationalist and
liberal dissidents from the great powers
as such the surrounding great powers all
demanded that the swiss keep tabs on
these people which they begrudgingly
agree to and now could actually do since
the recent civil war there had made it
into a much more centralized federal
state so given that the european powers
felt free to threaten switzerland
whenever it suited them how did it stay
neutral and not get itself belgium well
the first real threat to swiss
neutrality was the first world war the
danger didn't come from germany they had
other neutral nations to cross but from
france as the war raged on the french
wanted to flank the german army in the
south and so came up with a brilliant
idea of going through switzerland
hearing of this the swiss mobilized more
of their army and placed it on the
french border and this greater
resistance combined with the likely
backlash from britain meant that
switzerland was spared and after the war
its long-standing neutrality was also
part of the reason why it was chosen to
be the headquarters of the league of
nations and world war ii was the last
time that switzerland's neutrality was
threatened german leadership had wanted
to expand under the pretext of german
unity but they never invaded the country
for several reasons first of all a
neutral switzerland made for a useful
diplomatic trade hub since german and
allied diplomats could unofficially make
contact germany could also sell gold
that it had acquired to switzerland for
swiss francs which it could use to
purchase goods from third parties the
second reason the most important one was
that the costs far outweighed the
benefits switzerland was a mountainous
land with little in the way of natural
resources populated by a fiercely
independent people who were mostly armed
to the teeth and given that germany had
either bigger plans or much more
pressing issues the opportune moment to
invade never presented itself and after
this switzerland was able to maintain
its neutrality with no further threats
of war which is why geneva was made host
to a major u.n office in 1946 an
organization which the swiss refused to
join until 2002. i hope you enjoyed this

this is a docking station and I've done
over two and a half million dollars in
sales with it and in today's video I
want to go over how I went from zero to
that two and a half million dollars so I
make a lot of videos on my Channel about
projects that sell and how to make money
woodworking Etc I thought it would be
very necessary to tell this product
story of how I went from that zero to
two and a half million dollar Mark and
all the trials and tribulations that
came along the way that really
catapulted me from being that hobbyist
woodworker to that more professional
style woodworker and all the luck that I
had along the way to get to that point
because trust me it wasn't all skill it
wasn't all knowledge and so I just felt
almost obligated to tell you this story
because there's so much value packed
into it whether you're a small hobbyist
woodworker a weekend warrior or you own
a full-time business so stay tuned and
once again I hope you grab a lot of
value from this video this means a lot
to me and kind of my whole company so
thanks for watching let's get right into
it
thank you
I'm Ryan drapella I'm 27 years old I'm
from the small town of Ocampo Texas and
then I'm a CEO of Frio coolers drapella
works and cutting it close so the
product is called a docking station or a
phone Dock and I've actually coined the
term man stand because mostly women
bought it for their husband or their
boyfriend to put it on their nightstand
and what it did was it held a phone a
watch a wallet keys all of that stuff so
it kept like it's almost like a
catch-all tray it just was presented in
a very nice way and so we coined the
term man stand but it's really just a
phone docking station or a phone dock
so whenever I got the inspiration for
the man stand I just turned 20 years old
I was a sophomore in college it was 3 30
in the morning and I was bawling my eyes
out in my parents office at the computer
I was doing woodworking for about four
years at that point trying to do it full
time doing it full time and I had to pay
for college my truck just got in a wreck
and so I had
very little money in the bank account
less than 200 bucks and I didn't know
what to do and what I was currently
doing was barely making ends meet and I
was working 60 hours a week while trying
to go to college and it was extremely
rough
so what inspired the design of this
docking station well about a month
earlier I was watching a video over this
one Etsy shop that did over a quarter
million dollars in sales with only one
product and I was like that is awesome
and then I kind of forgot about it and
then when I was just bawling my eyes out
I had that Flash come to me it's like
Ryan why don't you just do that
[Music]
I started kind of Designing one similar
but most of them had two pieces of wood
that kind of slid in together and so
what I did is I knew I had a CNC I cut a
little part out in the center where only
people with the CNC could use it and so
it differentiated the design enough to
where I was different than his and the
one that did multi-million dollars in
sales was my original design I had zero
prototypes that was the one I went with
and that's the one that sold like crazy
did people think it was a good idea oh
oh no absolutely not my parents didn't
think it was a good idea all of my
brothers they still cannot believe it
did what it did
foreign
[Music]
I
didn't think it would go at all who's
going to buy something so stupid
when Ryan first showed me the phone dock
after I got finished laughing
it was
well let's give it a try didn't really
have support from any of the sides they
were like well this is just a little
doodad this is another one of your
hundreds of products you try to design
and it's going to flop but I had a lot
of faith in it nobody in a million years
on my side of the family thought it was
going to do good at all
the tools that I used to make this was
strictly a CNC a router table and a
random orbital sander so I made this out
of a five foot by five foot Baltic Birch
it was a 12 millimeter so which is about
a half inch thick and I made all of my
docking stations out of that from when
it started till even now the first time
I got all the materials from it so I
used to go to this this place called
Houston Hardwoods I had about 120
dollars to my name and I went there and
spent 119.28 on the first five sheets
and we thought oh my God we're gonna get
broke it's we spent a hundred dollars on
plywood I drove back home and was like
this better work and it was so
interesting because we made those first
couple ones out of those five sheets and
I went back two weeks later and bought
13 Sheets with whatever money I had left
it about killed if driving over there
getting those sheets coming back and
cutting out more phone docks and every
time we had a mess up we knew well
that's money out of our pocket
[Music]
[Music]
is the CNC room we originally cut them
all out on this CNC but then after we
got busy we cut them out on that CNC
that you see behind me you can actually
notice on this table where we used to
screw down the plywood to hold it down
before we cut out the original docking
stations that we made until we got that
one which has a vacuum table which held
all our products down a lot easier so it
was my production process efficient
absolutely not but it worked I think
what really helped is I had very low
overhead because I was working out of
some horse stalls and a yard and I
didn't really have you know insurance or
taxes to worry about or stuff like that
so besides the CNC taking a very long
time to cut them out sanding was
probably the second worst
foreign
[Music]
and we literally just put sandpaper
around our fingers and go like this a
whole bunch and then try to get the
corners with our thumb and sand down all
our fingerprints and then we ended up
getting a mouth sander and then an
oscillating sander to actually get those
but the first 500 of them we literally
just sanded with a piece of 180 grit
sandpaper like this and so it took about
10 to 15 minutes to per one we
eventually got that number down to about
five minutes per docking station but the
original was it was brutal so in general
how we finished them is we just put
stain on them that we found at Lowe's
and Home Depot it wasn't fancy stain it
was just Minwax you know penetrating
stain and we used natural golden pecan
dark walnut Red Oak and provincial
that was the five stains we used to
stain them all
[Music]
some of the early challenges that we
faced when they first started selling
and in that first eight weeks that we
unleashed them they sold you know about
fifty thousand dollars in sales and some
of the struggles were like just legitly
that CNC cutting out enough and we'd
have to run it 24 hours a day in order
to cut out enough and we thought we
couldn't really up the speed any when we
first did it we were just going by it
sounds good you know we were cutting it
out it sounds good we found out we
weren't running it fast enough and it
was dulling our bits pretty quick just
getting enough product to sand and ship
out was kind of the issue so we were
selling more than what our capacity was
so we were running 24 hour shifts in
those early days so whenever we first
started with them I already had one
employee and he's still with us today
hi I'm Anthony Rocha I'm 27 years old
been El Campo all my life
and I am a CNC operator we're working
Ryan for about
six or seven years already probably
going on seven
he was originally with me just to help
sand cutting boards and stuff like that
while I was in college he'd be back here
sanding cutting boards I'd come home on
the weekends I blew up cutting boards
and he'd sand them soon enough we were
getting so busy during the week that my
dad would actually come home after work
and program them on the CNC and then cut
them out Ryan was going to college I had
a full-time job
and he was making more money than I was
going to college making these phone docs
and you know I'm thinking what's wrong
with this picture
you know when he was gone we were
getting five or six a week which was you
know pretty good
and then we started getting more and I
would program and go cut them out sand
them stain them and then my mom would
ship them out the next day
I did the all the shipping from right
here the staining the sanding we just
took up the slack to 3 A.M still out
there
sanding and staining they were extremely
helpful in those early stages this was
Anthony with while I was trying to go to
college and put myself through school
they were helping me during the week I'd
come out on weekends I try to pound out
as much as I could and then they would
get any trickle through orders that
happened during the week it was a
certain size where we can just fit it in
a flat rate envelope super cheap to ship
those and so we really got away with not
having to buy boxes or anything like
that and then we started shipping a lot
of them so then we had to call like
corporate and they ship us a whole
pallet of it and then we switch over to
FedEx eventually and then we had to call
FedEx and they'd ship us a whole
18-wheeler load of these envelopes and
they you know obviously stacked really
well and so we just picked the thing
just let an envelope stick a label on it
ship it
[Music]
I started engraving them after that
first full year that really
differentiated myself and taught me a
ton of lessons once I did that and why I
thought of the engraving is I read a
book called How to Win Friends and
Influence People by Dale Carnegie and it
taught me you know the number one thing
to a person is their name so I was like
well I'm just going to sell somebody
their name once I started selling that
my profits margins went up and my sales
doubled overnight once I started adding
personalization I put them on Etsy
because I didn't know how to build a
website I didn't think there were a
store type product and so I just kind of
put them on Etsy and took some good
pictures and just kind of threw them out
there other than that I didn't really do
anything I didn't I ran a couple ads on
Etsy but nothing else no website no
Google ads no stores nothing like that
once again I think it's one of those
luck things that I just happened to
stumble upon Etsy happened to put it on
there and it happened to be a good fit
all right
I came out with it beginning of October
20 2016 within the first eight weeks we
did fifty thousand dollars in sales so
like I was onto something because the
previous year's total I didn't even do
fifteen thousand dollars in sales you
know and then another thing that I did
that really skyrocketed us was I started
offering different colors and nobody
else was offering different colors at
the time that kind of propelled my
product above everybody else when I knew
I was onto something was starting up in
May 2017 it started taking off for
Father's Day two weeks or three weeks
before Father's Day we were getting two
300 orders a day so the rush it's very
hard to put into words you would have to
see it unbelievable
4 30 5 o'clock in the morning I'd be up
at the computer printing label upon
label upon label we were making it and
shipping it and customizing it and
trying to fulfill all the orders and
doing all the customer service which
nobody ever thinks about from the Russia
I would say I have probably worked
around 12 hour days most days and then
they started getting more and more and
more and you know I'd go to work I'd
come home I'd program 25 30 of them a
day and the rush is nuts I mean shipping
wise imagine finding 500 different
people's names in a thing and reading
off of a little piece of paper following
the line like this is Susan and she gets
this color and it's it's shipping to Bob
and spread them out over my whole living
room the whole floor was covered and
then we tried lining them up and we'd
start calling them out and putting on
the labels and then we had Stacks higher
than the sofa
wbl
[Applause]
ah
oh wow I got so comfortable with sanding
that no matter what I did it was
detailing it was messing with the
orbital sander I even did the hand
motions and everything flipped it around
felt it made sure it was right
regardless of what I did I still kept
working despite me sleeping
I was asleep sanding
we went from our first year we did about
fifty thousand dollars in sales the next
year we did 150 the next year we did 450
the next year we did 650 and the next
year we did 1.6 million with just the
docking station
when did I decide to expand that was
always in the back of my head I always
planned on growing this thing to a huge
company you know so expansion was always
in my mind from day one I never thought
to not expand I always told myself that
I'm not smart enough to spend it in a
good way so just reinvest it back into
the business and that's always what I
did I figured there's no 20 year old
that I know that spends money in a good
way and so I was going to make sure I
wasn't going to be that 20 year old that
spent money in a bad way and so
everything I made I just always bought
new equipment and by the time I
graduated college I was able to buy two
acres of land and started building my
dream shop that I'm in now that's kind
of where all the money went I literally
just saved every penny I could you know
even now I still live in a trailer house
behind the shop because now my dream
shop is even bigger than this one and I
have bigger Ambitions and so yeah I just
put everything I could back in the new
equipment and you know just treated
people good
so the product started to fall off
probably the year after covid so the
2021 it started to fall off and that's
when I kind of learned about product
life cycles
why it spiked during 2020 was because
everybody was at home they couldn't see
their dad so they shopped online and I
happened to have a product that works
great for sending to dads you can
customize it tell them I love you Dad or
put dad stuff I love you engraved on it
and then now it still does pretty good
but it doesn't do those numbers that it
did back in the day and you know it's
all about that bell curve and then it
kind of flattening out now there's
thousands of different designs so many
people got in right people usually
destroy good things if you have it so if
you have a good design within three
years there's going to be thousands of
them
foreign
I thought I was just really lucky and
not skilled and I actually had a lot of
really weird issues whereas like am I
good did I just get lucky am I a real
woodworker do I know what I'm doing do I
know to run a business did I just get
lucky with this product and that sat
with me for quite some time even when I
was through college right I was doing
really good it was selling right but I
almost thought it was luck and now after
reflecting back on everything and taking
what I did learn and applying it to my
business now I'm really happy it came
about obviously it built a barn so like
I'm grateful for that but as far as
personal growth goes it helped out a ton
because I I extrapolated so many
different lessons from it that I never
thought I did
people always get mad at me they're like
Ryan what's next what happens when this
burns out and I always told them like I
don't care if it burns out right like
I'm making money from it now and that's
okay and my analogy always give them
since I was raised up on a farm I had to
milk a cow before I went to school I
always told them if the cow is standing
there milk it and get all the milk you
can before she kicks you or she flips
your tail at you and so that was kind of
where I went with this product is like
it's it's it's making money now let's
make sure we make all we can from it and
then we'll figure out the rest
afterwards don't worry about the future
that you cannot predict now just worry
about the present and that has really
helped me when designing new products
and when kind of taking on new
businesses and new business Adventures
family was definitely a crucial part
[Music]
they were always there when I was in
college right my parents were there like
shipping out stuff I actually got my dad
to quit his job whenever I was 21 and
actually start working for me so both of
my parents started working full time for
me whenever I was 21 years old
Ryan had asked me
Dad we're getting busy you know if you
want to quit your job and come help me
uh you know that'd be nice and so it
didn't take long for me to decide they
were super critical during those Rush
times where we had to go from five
employees during the year to 25.
well what I'm impressed is that he's you
know as young as he is
doing what he's doing most of the time
he just see you know older older folks
doing stuff they were always very
supportive of me trying to do something
with my life right trying to put myself
through college
I'm very proud I mean he's come a long
ways and he's
he had the ideas and and you know he did
it and we all pitched in as a family and
you know we all just kind of lift each
other up right and so the rising tide
lifts All Ships and that's what family
is to this business they're the rising
tide that always kind of tries to figure
out a way to help out any way they can
we was riding the wave
all in all this product was an absolute
blessing to me and my family my business
and I wouldn't have it any other way
when those late nights when we were
shipping and we were barely getting to
the post office on time that's when I
came up with the name cutting it close
um because remember if you ain't getting
it close you ain't cutting it right
[Music]
and they would try to catch me there was
a lot of times they'll try to catch me
but by the time they pulled out their
phone I already almost already looking
at them so
they couldn't catch me
why would you actually say it while you
were sleeping like I would

they say life is a gift and freedom is a
privilege what you I keep two little
goodies on the road my dreams got a
cooler 20 and a purse yeah so we will no

album oh it's my story
[Applause]

Renaissance Technologies is the most profitable 
hedge fund in history. This is probably the single  
most successful hedge fund in the history of the 
industry in terms of its performance record. Right  
so you gotta remember he charges a lot but 
um before fee is 66 on average since 1988.  
Behind the firm's wild success are a series of 
mathematical models and powerful computers. The  
quantitative models at Renaissance Technologies 
are constantly being updated but what's more  
important than those models are the ways and 
methods that are used to discover trading signals
Jim Simons the founder of Renaissance Technologies 
is a legendary mathematician. He pioneered  
a unique way of research and model building to 
the world of hedge funds. He's worth 21 billion  
dollars making him the highest earning hedge fund 
manager in the world. Born and raised in Brookline  
Massachusetts Jim Simons always knew that he 
wanted to be a mathematician. We used to go to a  
a delicatessen late at night when I was a student 
and one day I saw Ambrose and Singer come in  
late at night and they were obviously doing 
mathematics and I saw this on a number of  
occasions and I thought boy that's that's the 
greatest job in the world! When you can just  
hang out and hang out at a delicatessen and do 
mathematics. Simons' enrolled in MIT and even  
skipped the first year of mathematics thanks to 
advanced placement courses he took in high school.  
Simons' academic career was very smooth and after 
earning his PHD he quickly became a professor of  
math and also took a job as a cold war code 
breaker. But he yearns for more, particularly  
more money! Growing up in a middle-class 
family Simons' always wanted to get rich.  
Unlike other people in the academics who don't 
really care about money Simons' on the other hand  
knew exactly how to make money - start businesses. 
While still at school he started a business with  
his south American classmates they decided to 
start a factory to produce vinyl floor tile  
and PVC piping. Well I met some I made 
friends at MIT with two Colombian boys  
and they at a certain point started a business and 
in fact it was my encouragement that they started  
that business and my father and I invested a 
small amount uh in that business which turned out  
eventually uh to be a big success. This is a story 
of James Simons that a lot of people don't hear  
about so he took some time off to run the business 
at first but as soon as the business takes off  
he immediately delegated responsibilities to 
other people and we saw that time and time again  
with the story of RenTech but Simons' had to focus 
on his academic career in 1976 at the age of 37  
Simons was awarded the American mathematical 
society's Oswald Viblen price in geometry  
this price is the highest you can get in 
mathematics it's the equivalence of Nobel prize  
conquering one summit Simons was looking for 
a new mountain to climb in 1974 the floor tile  
company Simons' had started with his friends 
sold a 50 stake delivering profits to Simons  
and other owners Simons and his classmates made 
a lot of money from this business he said let's  
invest in the money so Simons knew a student of 
his who was running a hedge fund by the name of  
Charlie Fratfeld superseding Simons' wildest 
expectations he 10 x their original investment  
making them six million dollars total this is 
a moment Simons realizes the best way to make  
money is with finance he was wondering can I do 
the same in 1978 Simons left academia to start  
his own investment firm with the money he saved 
and from his friends he started money metrics
for years after starting money metrics Simons' 
relied on intuition and fundamentals to trade it  
was a great time to be in finance the fund is 
doing so well he didn't really have to change  
his approach but in the back of his mind 
he was wondering can he use the mathematics  
to model asset prices but Simons was getting 
tired of the fundamental trading we did very well  
but it was a gut wrenching experience you know 
it's you know one day you walk in and you think  
you're a genius god all my positions are in my 
way look up and the next day you walk in and  
they're against you and you feel here you're a 
dope how could I have done what I did and so on  
there was no rhyme or reason it was just you 
know you put your finger in the air and you  
try to sense which way the the wind is blowing 
Simons' quickly started working on his first model  
with the help of his colleague Lenny Baum they 
built a simple mean reversion model buy currencies  
if they moved a certain level below their recent 
trend line and sell if they veer too far above it  
the idea of meat reversion is very simple suppose 
you're a farmer and the average price of corn is  
five dollars a bushel now some days it may 
be six dollars a bushel other days it may  
be three dollars a bushel but in the long run 
these prices will revert back to the mean value  
this is what's called mean reversion back in 
the 80s many commodities were priced like this  
now his model would not work today but back 
in the 80s this was a revolutionary idea  
they quickly expanded the strategy beyond currency 
trading by 1982 he changed the company's name to  
Renaissance Technologies but soon enough their 
simple mean reversion strategy started to fail  
simple mean reversion is not sufficient anymore 
as other competitors started to build their models  
to stay ahead of the game Simons' had to hire more 
talents this is what really separates gm Simons  
apart from other hedge fund managers when he sees 
a problem he knows exactly who will be able to  
solve it he immediately brought another renowned 
mathematician jim x to develop a new strategy  
when Jim Axe looked at those asset prices 
he noticed that it is a stochastic process  
which is also called a random process and he 
believed that using mathematical representation  
is the best way to model those stochastic process 
when people hear about the word random they think  
that it's not predictable but that's not the 
case in mathematics suppose you threw a dice  
and you know each site will come up with a 
probability and you can bet on those probabilities  
to model the stochastic process they started 
using machine learning machine learning is such  
a buzzword today but in the 1980s most of hedge 
fund managers don't even know what that means and  
they still use their gut to trade but here's the 
Renaissance Technologies ahead of everybody else  
already started to use machine learning the 
style of machine learning that Ren Tech used  
was the kernel method the kernel used a 
class of algorithms to do pattern analysis  
the main tool used in academic finance is linear 
regression to this day linear regression is used  
to build forecasting models but the problem is the 
movement of asset prices is non-linear so rather  
than use linear regression Ren Tech decided to 
build non-linear models to predict price movements  
Simons' at the time was proposing building 
an early machine learning system this model  
would generate predictions for various commodity 
prices based on complex patterns clusters and  
correlations that'd be very hard for the naked eye 
to see once again they were so ahead of their time  
this kernel was like a black box that suggested 
trades that people couldn't even understand when  
the team started testing the model they quickly 
see great returns the firm began incorporating  
hard dimensional kernel regression approaches 
higher dimensional kernels work best for trending  
models they're great at predicting how long a 
trend will last at this point Simons have put  
up millions to this automated trading system 
they call it the medallion fund the Simons saw  
more potential improvement he started investing 
heavily in bringing more mathematical talents with  
the gen x model renaissance technology started 
to combine trend following with main reversion
the model has generated about 20 annual returns 
which is a great performance considering most of  
the hedge funds made less than 12 percent the 
Simons' wanted better he brought out another  
brilliant mathematician Ellyn Berlekamp 
Ellyn Berlekamp’s specialty was game and  
information theory he immediately suggested 
to focus on shorter term traits to reduce risk  
by going in and out quickly Simons took his advice 
and started focusing on shorter term approach  
they do a very different approach it's 
all patterns it's all short term it's not  
high frequency but it's something very distinct 
from what everybody else is doing now Berlekamp  
became fully in charge of the medallion fund he 
started fully implementing his ideas he argued  
they should learn to handle trades like casinos 
a casino doesn't care about any particular bet  
even if you win like 10 times a casino is happy 
because it knows that in the long run the casino  
has the statistical advantage this is what's 
called the law of large numbers I think what  
Ren Tech adopted was the kelly criterion this 
is what we call the scientific gambling method  
to put it simply it's your bet should be 
proportional to how confidence you are in your bet  
the formula is your expected net winnings divided 
by your net winnings if you win I think this  
is actually the secret sauce for Renaissance 
Technologies they utilize massive compute power  
combined with the scientific approach 
and to discover trading patterns and  
validate them and trade based on them they 
keep collecting uh the patterns and anomalies  
and that's how they stay ahead of the game well 
any one anomaly might be a random thing however  
if you have enough data you can tell that it's not 
so you can see an anomaly that's persisted for a  
sufficiently long time so that the probability 
of it being uh random is is not high but these  
things fade after a while anomalies can get washed 
out so you have to keep on top of the business  
the firm implemented its new approach in late 1989 
where the 27 million dollars Simons have put up  
the results were almost immediate and startling 
they did more trading than ever cutting medallions  
average holding time to just a day and a half 
and from a week and a half scoring profits almost  
every day the medallion scored a gain of 55.9 
percent in 1990 the incredible streak has begun
Simons' personal wealth sword he's never 
hesitant to pay his employee a lot of money  
so Jim Simons has bought a yacht every year 
he would bring his employees on his yacht to  
all the luxurious places in 
the world you can imagine
Simons' wanted to have more money to make real 
changes to the world he needed to expand his  
hedge fund business even more the only way to 
do that was getting into the equity business  
so far the medallion fund has been very 
successful at trading commodities but it  
was capped at 10 billion dollars till this day so 
when a hedge fund gets big every trade it makes  
gets bigger so we have a big trade like 
that it takes a long time for it to  
execute in the marketplace suppose you're 
trying to buy 10 million shares of apple  
it's going to take a while for the market to 
fill that order and by the time the orders are  
filled you might not actually get the price 
you originally planned and warren buffet is  
having the same problem that's why he's saying 
that he's looking for elephants now because  
the amount of stocks that he can have are so 
few nowadays they created a similar model to  
trade equities but it fails to deliver great 
returns Simons again knew exactly what to do  
he hired two top scientists from IBM and 
started tasking them with creating equity models  
peter brown and Robert mercer were experts 
in natural language processing it took them  
more than two years to solve this problem 
while their equity models kept losing money  
they discovered the reason why the mean 
reversion models don't perform as well  
is due to the execution of the trade their equity 
models were great at picking out best correctly  
but they were too unrealistic with the execution 
of those trades such as market impact and slippage  
so if you treat any stocks you immediately 
realize that you do not get the market price  
all the time this is the problem with the academia 
so whatever paper you read they always assume that  
you can get the market price but the market 
is a group of buyers and sellers constantly  
negotiating prices and if you participate 
in that market you do not always get the uh  
the market price brown and mercer realized that 
their strategy needs to model this aspect as well  
and minimize their trading cost once they solve 
the problem Ren Tech has entered into a new age  
Jim Simons went on a capital raised roadshow and 
expected its asset under management to the next  
level by 2000 the firm was managing 6 billion 
with 140 employees and the rest is history  
by 2020 Simons' retired from Ren Tech that year he 
made over 1 billion dollars what really separates  
Jim Simons apart is his ability to hire talents 
and to create an environment that the smartest  
people in the world utilize the maximum potential 
and more importantly James Simons insisted on  
using the scientific method to discover patterns 
and anomalies instead of using the gut intuition  
it's an open atmosphere everybody 
knows what everybody else is doing  
and every every week there's a research 
meeting if you've had a good idea that you  
you think it's going to go somewhere you 
present it if it looks good it goes to a  
small meeting people vet it more carefully but 
there aren't little groups working in the dark  
oh this is my little system and I want you to 
use it so and that's the best way to do science  
I think since Simons' left the firm Ren Tech 
has still been beating the market consistently  
the fun is so successful almost to a mythical 
level but as we now see there is no mystery  
behind the firm's success is Jim Simons' ability 
to gather talents and also his will to succeed  
don't give up I mean now  
sometimes is discretion is the better part of 
valor and you can just say the hell with it but uh  
and go on to something else and that's a decision 
that we've all made at one time or another but uh  
persistence has a lot of value and something 
that's really worthwhile can take a lot of time to  
come to fruition and you ought to have patience uh 
if you believe in something to uh to stick with it

changing photographers the deadline for
the contest has
[Applause]
one of the very end of it
Oh
hey guys I hope you enjoyed that making
this short film was a lot of fun and I'm
gonna show you how we did it
it begins VFX here was obviously
creating the CD siren head I use blender
for making the character for the
animation I used a motion capture suit
by Rococo who we collaborated with on
this video and this suit made my life so
much easier if not for motion capture I
would have had to animate the senior
characters manually and it's such a slow
process now I just put the suit on and
act out all the stuff I need one of the
cool things about the smart suit is that
it's really easy to setup and it
connects to my computer via Wi-Fi so we
could even shoot outdoors just put the
suit on and do your thing and then have
all of that sweet animation applied to
any character an animation that would
have taken me a full day to make now
only takes me a few minutes it's a huge
time saver and as a filmmaker also does
VFX this is really valuable ultimately
it helps me make better stuff but in
lesser time thanks once again to Rococo
for this amazing collaboration make sure
to check out their web site to learn
more about how you can use motion
capture in your work all right guys
that's it for this video let me know if
you have ideas for my next video and if
you're new here consider subscribing and
I'll see you in the next video bye

- Our next event is set
to be at fashion week
and it needs to be the biggest
and best event of its kind.
We've never done something like this
and it's the perfect time to do it.
We did New York before.
Not everyone was there.
Not everyone was able to be involved.
Yeah, it will be a lot, but
it's also gonna be amazing.
And what a reward for the
team to be able to see
all of that going on.
We need to top everything
that we've ever done before.
This is more sophisticated
and let's not forget
we've got our new creative
director on board.
(upbeat music)
- So I think one of the things on the list
that I really need to get sorted
I wanna have another look at the venue
and just make sure that
everything there is sorted.
Now, we've got the production
team coming in with ideas.
We need to make sure they
align with like the venue
and stuff and that it's all gonna work.
I'm so pleased with how
everything is going.
I was so nervous at the start,
but now everything's rolling
and we're getting on with things.
The team is just doing
absolutely incredibly
everyone's excelling at their own jobs
and all my fears and reservations
about things have actually
been calmed so much down.
I'm so excited to carry on
with organizing and all.
(upbeat music)
- So my name is Jade,
I'm the events and brand
experiences manager
here at PrettyLittleThing.
I have been here for about eight months.
And all I can say is it's been
a crazy whirlwind over time.
When it comes to a show,
my job's really not done
until the show is over.
Just working from concept
phase to execution
and then breakdown is essentially
everything that I would do.
So I work with every single team,
when it comes to the design,
the aesthetic of the show,
the logistics where is it gonna be?
What's gonna happen?
What are people gonna eat?
This is definitely gonna be
one of the highlights of my career.
I've always, always, always wanted to do
something in London.
And yeah, it's definitely
gonna be a challenge.
There's definitely gonna
be a lot of expectation
because it is London
based and we are all here
but I think it's gonna
be absolutely incredible.
(upbeat music)
- I think what we've pulled
together here is so perfect.
Definitely the best collection yet.
- Yeah, definitely-
- By far, which is so, so good.
I think every single time
we pull together a new one
obviously we say it's the best
one yet, but I do actually
think this is-
- 200%.
- This is something fresh
and it's so current.
And I feel like it's on trend.
There's something-
- It's very you.
- Very me and there's so in
here for everyone I think,
and the pieces are so versatile
so obviously they could be start
of a million different ways.
I think with the trousers
on some of the outfits
that are quite low, I
think if we make them
a little bit higher up,
just so that they're
a bit more wearable for like the customer.
I think the low rise is great,
but also when you wanna go out
for dinner with your mates,
you're not really wanting something
that's got your full belly out
so you can go out and enjoy your dinner.
- That's a lot more outfit to normal.
- Yeah, 'cause last time we
did 24, this time around 38
which is a bigger
collection, a bigger one.
So I'm Chris, I am head
design here at PLT.
At PLT, I oversee the design department.
I set the trends.
So when it comes to this fashion show
what my role has been is
basically designing the collection
alongside Molly coming up
with the concepts, the vibe,
the feel for it.
As a collection, it's
probably one of the ones
I'm most proud of because
it is really commercial
and it is like one way we
can just kind of have that
true PLT freedom 'cause Molly is PLT.
And I think that's why we work
so well together as a team.
And I'm just really excited
about what it's gonna turn out like.
Yeah, so these are the prints
that we've got within here.
So obviously just like a
classic kind of PLT vibe
but then I think we need an
element of like chic as well,
so it's a bit more high
end with our classic pop
of just brights basic list.
We kind of got a mix for everyone.
So we wanna keep it just kind of too muted
and having a tree pop there,
which is obviously our girl.
So that'll be great.
And we absolutely obsessed with the cloak.
This with the chiffon obsessed, love it.
The list we've got linens, chiffons,
we've got huge shoulder pads, knitwear,
twists, draw strings
this kind of whole night
is vibe with the boot.
- Cut it all.
- So like the favorites like
boom, boom is really like
elements of nine is elements
of true PLT, everything.
It's all here.
- I'm so glad we've had this meeting.
Definitely put my mind at rest.
Everything's looking exactly
how I think it should be.
And you guys have done an
absolutely incredible job
as always so hands in the middle.
(cheering)
(upbeat music)
- Yeah, rough idea to open.
Obviously we've got the idea
of a few neutrals pops of color.
but this cloaks definitely like-
- One of the key.
- One of the key piles.
- And we need to open with the key though.
We need to open one of the
favorite looks that we all love.
- So my name's Talia, I'm a
creative manager here at PLT.
If I could sum up my role
and my key responsibilities
it would be the running
of the studio day to day
and all the teams in between.
One of my main like highlights
is something that really
stands out to me is in 2019,
I found out I was pregnant
and that was not an issue for me.
But in terms of work, it was
like, okay, let's take this on.
Let's go to New York fashion week,
let's see what you can do.
And I was like six months pregnant.
I was just kind of running backstage,
out at the front, show calling.
Then I was running backstage.
This time it just feels
like more of a family affair
and just like a little bit more special.
Yeah, this time I won't be thinking,
I need to have a little sit down.
There's a lot involved
in terms of making sure
that we have the brand vision,
we have our PLT old school girls
that you're gonna see her
and you're gonna think,
yeah, she's a PLT girl.
Now when everything's confirmed
and it's like, okay, we've got the team,
we've got the models,
but it's now like, okay,
we need to put it all into play.
What's the run of show gonna be?
What product's going with what model?
How is that then gonna
be matched up altogether
to make an actual show?
I started off here in 2015
and I was just looking
for somebody to give me a chance.
It worked my little Tosha, can I say that?
And just worked hard,
gave it my everything.
Now it's just such a big
pinnacle moment in my career.
Have that special time with your child
but also be successful and
really enjoy and love your job.
We're doing a fashion
show and it's in London
and it's gonna be incredible.
(upbeat music)
- We have everything
prepped for the social plan?
- Yeah, I feel like G you were working
on the Instagram plan and that's
all pretty good, isn't it?
We're in a good place with that.
So I think them guys are ready
with the actual social takeover
- And I signed that off
last week, so it's all good.
- Yeah, you've seen that
but it's the social graphics
for just the livestream.
- I'm Becky, I'm the senior
social media manager at PLT.
So the social team are
gonna be responsible
for quite a lot during fashion week.
The main thing that we'll
be doing is the stream.
We do a live stream of the
show from start to finish.
My team is also responsible
for doing the story coverage
and Instagram coverage
of the show as well.
So there'll be a lot of
content going around there
on TikTok as well working
with the influences
to create little snippets of content.
What's happening on the
show, behind the scenes,
back of house, front of house.
I guess there are a lot
of pressures in my role
because what we put out
there on the channels for PLT
is essentially the PLT voice.
So yeah, there's a lot of eyes on it
internally in the
business, but also outside.
We have a lot of like fans
and consumers and followers.
PLT it's over 27 million at the moment.
It has to look great.
It has to represent PLT
as best as possible.
Now more than ever there's
so many eyes on PLT,
so we have to get this right.
- Anything you want me to work on today?
Because from here, I'm just
gonna like I say, speak stuff,
get contact sheet, get going.
Is there anything else you want me
to get prepared or ready for?
- I think you should start
red carpet interviews
just to make sure that we've
got the run of plan for that
as much as well.
- I need an outfit.
- You do need an outfit.
- Do I even have an outfit?
What is everyone gonna wear?
Like what are you actually gonna wear?
- Well we all have crew
t-shirts, but you VIP over here.
- Well, I'm gonna wear,
I'm gonna look really nice.
- I'm gonna punch your wrist.
- Stunning, that'd be great.
(clapping)
- This looks insane honesty,
these colors and these prints
like this cloak is such high quality.
- And we've done that across
all the colors as well.
So we've got the prints kind
of bring it all in together.
So you've got all your neutrals
then you've got your fun as we discussed.
And then you've got like your
classic strips basically.
- This bag.
- That is my favorite.
This with the boot, that
is my, hang in there.
- Oh, wow.
- Where's the boot?
- That's the vision.
- Come on now, come on now.
- Yeah, gorgeous.
- Stunning.
- Yeah, that'll be sick.
I love, love, love it so much.
- I'm glad you're happy.
(applauding)
- So there's a lot of things
that need doing still.
We don't have an awful lot of time
but we know that we can turn this around.
I'm so proud of the team so far
just because we've already moved forward
into the more logistical phase of things.
So we've got pretty much our
basis in terms of the creative
but now we just need to figure out
how we're gonna actually get it done.
- Nervous, excited.
There's a lot of pressure,
but good pressure.
We work very, very well
under tight deadlines.
It just adds the excitement
and yeah, just wanna get it done now.
- One sec Noc just called me.
- Hi, I'm here with Molly now.
- You all right?
- [Speaker 1] Everyone hear me?
- Hi.
- [Speaker 1] Hi, that's okay?
- Yeah.
- [Speaker 1] So I've just
got off the phone to Nicki
and unfortunately right
now we don't have a venue.
- Right now without that
venue we don't have a show.
It's the only venue I see
that show happening in.
It's a crisis I just didn't see coming.
I literally don't know
what we're gonna do.
I don't have the answers right now.
- Our date doesn't work for the venue.
And I think it goes without saying
that if we don't have a
venue, we don't have a show.
So I'm gonna have to make some calls
and figure out where
we're gonna do the show.
Hi, this is Jade calling from PLT.
Hi, this is Jade.
I wanted to find out
if you have any availability in that room.
No.
Could you maybe do the 16th?
No.
Yeah, I know it's such a busy week
'cause we really, really liked your venue.
- You have to think of a plan B.
- Team have put so much effort into this
and I've gotta turn around
and tell them it's all down.
There's nothing I can do.
I really dunno what to tell them.
(upbeat music)

watch out here comes some serious
equipment with a long
cannon-like pipe but why is there a
steel capsule
at the end of the pipe and why the
pulley
this monster seems aggressive high time
to dive down
but there's nothing to worry about this
giant comes in peace
the khan strat is unique i mean we're
the only ones i'd say who can walk on
the riverbed and not get our feet wet
how is that possible what is this
unusual river rhine rarity
the carl strat is a diving bell ship
that's been around for 50 years
and is the only ship of its kind in
europe
and this is what it looks like command
bridge and accommodation are on the fore
ship
there's a pressure chamber in the middle
and what looks like a cannon barrel is a
shaft that leads into a kind of capsule
the diving bell the deck crane with its
steel cables and pulley
lifts and lowers the diving belt through
the divided stern
but how does it stay dry inside the belt
the diving bell is attached to the stern
a special mechanism keeps it horizontal
in any position
the diving bell works like an upside
down cup under water
a compressor blows air inside it and the
overpressure displaces the water
the bell can be submerged to a depth of
10 meters
once it reaches the bottom the men on
the riverbed can do their work without
getting their feet wet
the bell is a kind of workshop
underwater however
regulations dictate that from a depth of
seven meters
workers can only stay down here for
three hours at the most
today a special mission awaits the couch
light the diving bell ship has to
recover a lost anchor that is posing the
danger to shipping
here the rhine passes through a
mountainous region and due to the
gradient there's a strong current
such salvage operations would be
difficult for divers but not for the 600
ton carl start
ryan kilometer 564. ten weeks ago
a freighter lost its anchor here since
then a yellow raft has warned passing
ships of potential danger
but the crew does not know exactly where
it was lost
the captain anchors the huge vessel
upstream of the suspected hazardous area
then he lowers the diving belt
after 20 minutes the bell is ready for
action at a depth of four meters
however yet munsterman and his
colleagues can't start their work
immediately
before they're allowed to enter the belt
they first have to go into this chamber
the bunker-like dungeon is a compressed
air lock
dirk pumps air into it via a regulator
the men have to get used to the over
pressure in the diving bell
and equalize the pressure like during a
flight this is called transfecting
if you want to get into the bell you
have to be in top shape
and have a doctor's certificate just
like a diver
today the men will have to go down to
four meters
with every step down it gets louder and
foggier
the humidity is almost a hundred percent
the bell is controlled from the command
bridge equipment operator ralph
is connected by telephone with lock
keeper dirk
ralph brings the bell into position just
above the rhine bed
the search for the lost anchor can begin
but how exactly does it work
since the bell can only be moved up and
down the entire ship has to be
maneuvered to change
the position of the bell with the bell
lowered
they search the riverbed section by
section
dirk and his colleagues are quite
literally fishing in muddy waters
the salvage operation is anything but
easy
the men have already been working for
hours in this exhausting compressed air
by now the crew has searched the 30 by
100 meter area almost completely
so far in vain but then suddenly a
suspicious
noise from the bell
yes i think they have something the
anchor's coming in
inch by inch the bell slides itself over
the heavy 1700 kilogram anchor
whenever we find something it's always a
great feeling then we can say thank god
we've found the anchor
and the owner is also looking forward to
getting back his 6 000 euro anchor
incidentally the ship is named after the
first president of the duisburg rhine
shipping administration karl strat
and even after a century he would still
be rightly proud
of his diving bell ship

16:18 and bohemia here is in revolt at
this point Bohemia formed an important
part of the Holy Roman Empire and had
since the Protestant Reformation moved
steadily away from Catholicism much of
this was thanks to their prior rulers
such as Matthew so allowed the
Protestants greater freedom of worship
this was built upon the previous 1555
Peace of Augsburg which allowed for
rulers of territories within the Holy
Roman Empire to choose its religious
denomination so long as that
denomination was Catholicism or
Lutheranism that is Mathias didn't have
any children and so appointed an heir
Ferdinand of Styria the Archduke of
Austria who succeeded him as King of
Bohemia in 1617 Ferdinand was a devout
Catholic and so sent representatives to
bohemia' to shut down the Protestant
churches and demand the conversion of
its nobles the Bohemians had a clever
way of countering this they threw
Ferdinand's representatives out of a
third-story window an event known as the
second defenestration of Prague because
this was not the first time people have
been thrown out of a window for
religious reasons
Ferdinand unsurprisingly was unhappy
that his representatives who survived by
the way were treated as such
bohemia' was thus plunged into a civil
war many of the Holy Roman Empire's
Catholic states were dragged into the
war as well
Bohemia was aided by these states
notably the Palatinate and Transylvania
and were given financial aid by the
Netherlands it's worth noting that there
were other Protestant states within the
Empire the most notable being Saxony who
remained neutral because they didn't
want any trouble
Spain and its territories led also by
the Habsburg join the war on the side of
their German relatives and things
weren't looking good for Bohemia so the
leader of the Bohemian rebels was
Heinrich Cerne who reached out to
Frederick of the Palatinate who in 1619
was crowned as king of bohemia bohemia'
was reaching out to other major
protestant powers like England Sweden
and Denmark Norway but they were very
cautious and didn't approve of
Frederick's actions with the King of
Denmark Christian the fourth asking him
who advised you to drive out kings and
seize kingdoms in the same year
Ferdinand was made Holy Roman Emperor
and third even managed to march on
Vienna but to no avail 1620 saw the
Bohemian revolt crushed at the decisive
battle of the white mountain with the
Imperial forces being led by johann
circus the count of Tilly as a result
the Bohemian leadership fled in
Transylvania made peace which left the
Palatinate as the only major resisting
state resistance continued there until
1622 when it was conquered and the
majority of the Protestant forces were
pushed out of the Empire the next year
sporadic fighting continued but was
crushed by 1625 our sending the first
phase of the war could the Bohemian
phase there was however now a power
war running between Spain and the
Netherlands who had resumed the eighty
Years War it seemed that this would be
the end of the conflict but King
Christian who also held lands in the
Empire was concerned the Protestants
would be persecuted severely he decided
to intervene in 1625 marching his army
down south two-faced hilly in another
Habsburg general outbreak from Valen
Steen a Catholic bohemian who made lot
of money by seizing Protestant lands
there this began the second phase of the
war the Danish phase Christians
intervention went poorly and he was
subject to continuous defeats at the
hands of both Chilean volunteen and he
was pushed back into Denmark Christian
had expected his fellow Protestant kings
in Sweden and England to back him but
both had failed to do so
demet was also backed financially by the
French who as you'll note were Catholic
meaning that this war was about more
than religion the French simply wanted
to weaken the Habsburg neighbors but the
support had to stop when their own
Protestant population the Hyuga nose
revolted in 1629 Christian the fourth
signed the treaty of Lloyd Beck which
allowed him to keep his territories on
the condition that he stay out of the
affairs of the Empire the problem still
remained that the Protestant domains of
Europe were concerned about a powerful
Catholic Empire neighboring them the
mantle of defending Protestants fell to
the Swedish King Gustav ii better known
as Gustavus Adolphus who art the
finishing a war with the Polish
Lithuanian Commonwealth decided to
intervene much like Christian the fourth
Gustavus also received financial help
from the French
unlike Christian the fourth however
Gustavus intervention was wildly
successful
fortunately for Sweden fallen Steen had
been dismissed by the distrustful and
preferred inand in 1630 leaving Tilly is
the best commander available in 1630
Swedish forces landed here in Pomerania
which was itself Protestant and
currently fighting Emperor this began
the third stage of the war the swedish
phase once there the swedish managed to
threaten brandenburg-prussia into giving
them help Gustavus also attempted to
bring Saxony into the war but its leader
John George the first wanted to remain
neutral
Tilly fearing a Saxon Swedish alliance
invaded Saxony forcing John George to
join Gustavus out of desperation oops in
1631 a combined swedish Saxon force met
Tilly the most famous battle of the war
the Battle of Brighton felled Tilly's
much larger force was utterly crushed
and both sides met again the next year
at the Battle of rain which was another
Swedish victory and also saw Tilly
killed so the question here is why did
Sweden win where Denmark lost the answer
is complicated but Sweden had a slightly
more efficient way of recruiting and
arming soldiers the normal way was that
a noble would be asked to fund his own
soldiers which cost a lot in return for
the
spoils of war in a chance at everlasting
glory army upkeep came at the cost of
whichever region was hosting them and
was often devastating for the local
population their sweden's method of
raising troops was slightly different
for a start Sweden being Protestant men
the Gustavus was the head of the Church
of Sweden and he used local churches the
census to determine population
specifically the taxable and recruitable
population however there were still
incredible burdens on the areas of the
Holy Roman Empire which hosted the
Swedish army as for the military side
Gustavus his army focused much more on a
doctrine of masked fire and combined use
of muskets cannon and cavalry to shock
the enemy warfare was naturally moving
in this direction and both the Spanish
and Dutch had made use of this first but
Gustavus embraced this new form of
warfare to great ends so back to the war
Gustavus had marched his army through
massive waves of Imperial territory by
1632 but had to prevent the reinstated
volunteen from outmaneuvering him the
two met at the Battle of lutes in which
was a Swedish victory but did seek a
staff as Adolphus and his horse killed
in 1634 volun steam was also
assassinated on the orders of the
Emperor and so both sides had lost some
of their most proficient generals except
for the Spanish in the Dutch but they
were busy 1634 also saw the tide turn in
favor of the Habsburgs at the Battle of
nordlingen the swedish army was
obliterated by the spanish who were
commanded by Cardinal Infante Ferdinand
who were now firmly involved in the
wider war the next year saw the signing
of the Peace of Prague which saw Saxony
Brandenburg and the other Protestant
states in the Holy Roman Empire make
peace leaving only sweden against the
emperor in spain the dutch were still
fighting as well but they had their own
objectives France led by king louis xiii
and under the advice of cardinal
richelieu believed that the Peace of
Prague made the Habsburg stew powerful
and so decided on direct confrontation
the French declared war on Spain in 1635
in the Holy Roman Empire the next year
which began the French phase of the war
Richelieu had a clever strategy during
the war which was to not only fight
head-on but also to fund rebellions and
foreign armies which would force Spain
in the empire to fight a war on several
fronts
despite this things went poorly for the
French at first with Infante Ferdinand
pushing all the way to the edge of Paris
via the Spanish Netherlands the next
four years were incredibly intense
fighting with major a minor victories on
both sides it also saw and preferred now
in the second eye in 1637 and he was
succeeded by his son Ferdinand the third
so with all this fighting and turmoil
what was life like for the people of the
Holy Roman Empire to put it mildly it
was miserable the war brought horrendous
level
of starvation plunder disease poverty in
general misery to the people there these
people needed someone to blame and they
had one specific group in mind
witches persecutions of witches were
particularly severe in the Catholic
South but given the widespread
destruction of the lands across the
entire Empire nobody was really spared
the persecutions largely ended when the
swedish intervened because stopping a
foreign army was you know a bigger
priority the war was still waging
fiercely in 1640 in Spain was struggling
with Portugal and Catalonia the latter
of which had declared itself a
principality under the rule of louis
xiii portugal was being helped
financially by the french - and all of
this meant that spain had to withdraw
its troops from its possessions in the
rest of europe sweden was still fighting
in the holy roman empire and in 1642
when the Second Battle of Brighton
failed which basically gave a control
over all of the north
in the same year Cardinal Richelieu died
in louis xiii decided to follow suit the
next year leaving france with the child
king and under the Regency of Louie's
wife Anne of Austria the next year so an
important French victory require which
ended the idea of Spanish military
invincibility and showed that France was
still stable and would probably continue
its rise so by this point everyone was
getting bit sick and tired of this war
and so delegates began discussing the
terms for peace with each other these
peace talks would take many years to
come to any sort of agreement and whilst
they were ongoing Sweden found itself in
a new war this time with Denmark the
Swedish one and in the end they took all
of this territory but it did serve to
distract them somewhat from the war with
the Empire of course the Swedish would
return quickly pushing south and after
meeting up with the French continuously
defeated the Imperial forces driving
them further south in 1646 attempts to
make peace were stepped up by both sides
because this war had been raging for
literally twenty-eight years now and
everyone was a bit tired the
negotiations were held over several
years in the cities of osnabrück and
Munster in January 1648 the Netherlands
and Spain's on the Peace of Munster on
which Spain recognized Dutch
independence thus ending the eighty
years war the Hapsburgs negotiating
position was weakened in later 1648 when
the French won an immense victory at the
Battle of long the Swedish also laid
siege to Prague at this time but little
came of it after this - more peace
treaties were concluded the first was
the Treaty of Munster which made peace
between France and the Holy Roman Empire
but not Spain the second was the Treaty
of osnabrück which made peace between
Sweden and the Holy Roman Empire
collectively these are known as the
Peace of Westphalia and they had some
territorial changes
notably with Sweden France and
Brandenburg gaining these lands it also
reinstated the Peace of Augsburg
allowing religious toleration of
Calvinism and is largely considered to
be the beginning of the modern era of
international diplomacy the reason for
this is that individual states were now
treated as sovereign with no difference
in the rights of one governed by Duke a
king or an emperor this shows just how
much the war changed over the decades
from one driven by a desire of
Protestant states to protect their
fellow believers - one driven by the
geopolitical desires of France and Spain
the legacy of the 30 Years War is
complex it's or the rise of Sweden in
France and the decline of the Holy Roman
Empire is Europe central power this was
mostly because it was now entirely
decentralized but also because the
population loss within the Empire was
catastrophic and important something to
remember when discussing the wars
military glories I hope you enjoyed this

On the 4th of January, 2012, a user on 4chan
posted this image
to the site's infamous /b/ or random board.
The anonymous author, who went by the four-digit
pseudonym 3301, challenged users to uncover
a message hidden within the image.
Unbeknownst to those who stumbled across it,
someone had just set in motion one of the
most elaborate scavenger hunts the internet
has ever seen.
Within minutes of the image being posted someone
discovered that by opening the file using
a text editor an appended string of readable
text could be found.
The string contained a cipher that, once deciphered,
formed a link to yet another image.
At first this appeared to be a dead end but
using an application known as OutGuess
users were able to extract hidden information embedded
within the first image.
The extracted information lead to a subreddit
which in turn contained information about a book.
The book along with a code could
then be used to uncover a
phone number that, when called,
played this prerecorded message.
By the following day, the initial image had
been reposed all over the internet.
A growing community of armchair detectives
sought to unravel this elaborate puzzle but
no one was quite sure what to make off it.
What was the puzzle for?
Who was behind it?
What happens when you reach the end?
Some naturally dismissed it as an elaborate
joke while others perceived its complexity
as evidence against it being the work of a
mere troll.
Before long, rumors began to circulate that
this could be the work of some secret society
or intelligence agency with the intent of
recruiting individuals proficient in
cryptography, steganography,
and other related fields.
Of course, it was nothing but a rumor.
The two missing numbers mentioned in the recording
proved to be the dimensions of the original image.
After multiplying the width and height with
3301 and using the product as a web address,
users were taken to a website.
The website consisted of a countdown as well
as an image of a cicada.
When the countdown reached zero, the page
was updated with a list of coordinates.
The coordinates pointed to locations around
the globe.
14 locations in 5 different countries.
It was now up to participants living near
the specified coordinates to rise from their
comfortable armchairs and venture outside.
Those who believed Cicada to be the work of an
organization now felt their beliefs had been justified.
In their opinion, only some international
collective possessed the means and resources
to create a scavenger hunt of this magnitude.
This was not the work of your average troll.
No, this had to be something else.
At each location was a poster with the cicada
symbol and a QR code.
...on the bike shelter over here.
See I got it... I got it right there.
You can see the corners, I just kinda ripped it off.
The codes linked to an image, the image contained
a riddle, the riddle lead to a book,
and the book lead to a website.
But here, the puzzle took an unexpected turn.
Only a select group of first arrivals to this website
were accepted into the final stage of the puzzle.
The site eventually closed down with the message:
"We want the best, not the followers."
The finalists were also warned not to collaborate
with others nor to share the details of this
private stage of the puzzle.
Well, given that we know this, it's safe to
say that not everyone heeded that warning.
But those who did presumably advanced through
the final stages before reaching the very
end of the puzzle.
After nearly a month of silence an image appeared
on the subreddit announcing the conclusion
of the puzzle and, just like that, the hunt
was over.
Cicada had supposedly found the
"highly intelligent individuals" they were looking for
and whatever happened to them is a bit of a
mystery but more on that in a moment.
The lack of an explanation was perceived by
many as confirmation that the puzzle had been
nothing but a wild-goose chase intent on wasting
everyones time.
After all, questions raised by the original
image remained unanswered.
What was the puzzle for?
Who was behind it?
What happens when you reach the end?
However, as it later turned out, this was
only the beginning.
Whomever was behind this intricate game had
the foresight to include an authentication
code known as a PGP signature
along with every clue.
This allowed users to verify that an image
or message was actually from Cicada as opposed
to some impostor seeking to derail or hijack
the puzzle.
Cicada had repeatedly warned of such "false paths"
and insisted that any message lacking
a valid PGP signature should promptly be disregarded.
That's why this image, posted exactly a year
and a day after the first, provoked such a frenzy.
After a year of lackluster imitations, this
image finally matched the official PGP signature.
Cicada was back and it was time for round two.
The second puzzle was not too dissimilar from
the first.
The image enclosed a message, the message
lead to a book, the book produced a link,
and gradually the puzzle unfolded.
At one point, a recording titled
The Instar Emergence was uncovered.
Another clue lead to a cryptic Twitter account
which then lead to an image.
The image proved vital to the progression
of the puzzle but the inclusion of this runic
alphabet would remain a mystery for quite
some time.
Much like the first puzzle the second swelled
into the physical world when a list coordinates
compelled participants to, once again, take
to the streets in search of enigmatic posters.
This time it was
8 locations in 4 different countries.
But eventually the trail went cold once again.
Another select group of first arrivals had
been accepted into a final private stage of the puzzle.
Unlike the first puzzle the second did not
conclude with an official message from Cicada.
The trail merely went cold and Cicada vanished
once more leaving us no closer to an explanation.
However, this was still not the end.
At the beginning of 2014
it was time for round three.
Once again the image enclosed a message, the
message lead to a book, the book produced a link,
and suffice it to say, it was more
of the same.
Except, this time, the puzzle seemed to revolve
around a strange book.
The book was titled Liber Primus, meaning
First Book in Latin, and was evidently written by Cicada.
The runic alphabet uncovered in 2013 finally made
sense as the book was primarily written in runes.
Even so, the meaning of the translated pages
were cryptic at best.
The book consisted of various philosophical and
idealogical ideas and appeared to be their manifesto.
Many have since compared the strange writings
to that of a cult.
Nevertheless, the book also comprised a myriad
of clues and codes.
For example, this page advised participants
to seek out a website on the deep web
but the site remains undiscovered.
Another page lead to a website containing
yet another recording titled Interconnectedness.
However, a significant portion of the book
has yet to be translated.
The runic text on some of the pages appear
to be obfuscated by layers of encryption
that has yet to be decrypted.
Of the 74 pages featuring runes, only 19 have
been successfully translated.
As 2015 came and went without the launch of
a new puzzle, many came to suspect the Liber Primus
had to be completed if Cicada was to return.
This was more or less confirmed
at the beginning of 2016
when Cicada encouraged
a reexamination of the book.
More than four years have now gone by with minimal
progress and near complete silence from Cicada.
Questions raised by the original image have
gone ignored.
What is the purpose of these puzzles?
Who's behind them?
What happens when you reach the end?
When the initial image appeared on 4chan back
in 2012 many assumed Cicada 3301 to be an
alternate reality game designed by a corporation
to promote a new service or product.
For example, Microsoft developed an elaborate
ARG back in 2001 to promote the film
Artificial Intelligence and a similar viral marketing
campaign was used to promote the release of Halo 2.
But the release of subsequent puzzles and
the complete lack of commercialization
has more or less eliminated that possibility.
If we choose to believe some of the leaked
information from the private end-stage of
each puzzle than we do gain some insight into
who this group might be.
For example, at the end of the first puzzle,
finalists supposedly received this email.
In it, Cicada describe themselves as an international
group who believe that privacy is an inalienable right.
The aim of each puzzle is to recruit
like-minded individuals
in an effort to develop
privacy-conscious solutions.
The email then concludes with three questions.
The PGP signature, which would have confirmed
the authenticity of the email, was conveniently
removed by the leaker.
If a version with a valid signature does exists
online I was unable to find it.
But regardless of it's legitimacy, I find
this question a bit odd.
It reads:
"Do you believe that information should be free?"
Assuming the expected answer is yes then the
very first sentence...
"DO NOT SHARE THIS INFORMATION!"
...seems a bit hypocritical.
While the idea of a secret society recruiting
individuals by means of elaborate cryptographic
puzzles may seem a bit absurd or even conspiratorial,
it's not entirely unfounded.
Corporations and governments alike have employed
similar recruitment techniques since at least
the second World War.
In 2013, the British intelligence agency GCHQ
launched a recruitment program known as
"Can You Find It?".
Participants had to decrypt a number of cryptograms
hidden across the internet and those who managed
to solve the entire puzzle were offered a
prize or a position at the agency.
Google did something similar with enigmatic
billboards back in 2004 and the US Navy launched
a near-identical project in 2014.
Okay, but then, what about the recruits?
Why have we not heard from these chosen few?
Well, we have.
It's just that separating a legitimate finalist
from an impostor is virtually impossible.
In a 2015 interview with Rolling Stone, two
alleged winners of the first puzzle chronicled
the events beyond the final stage.
After receiving an email from Cicada they
were taken to a forum on the dark web.
Here, they could communicate with some twenty
some odd recruits as well as a handful of
established members of Cicada.
They were told that Cicada 3301 had been founded
by a group of friends who shared common ideals
about security, privacy, and censorship.
The goal was to work as a collective to develop
software applications in line with that ideology.
As friends recruited friends, this secret
society quickly expanded into a decentralized
international organization.
The recruits were then tasked with developing
software that fit the ideology of the group
and members of Cicada would oversee their
progress.
But without the allure of a puzzle to be solved,
the recruits quickly lost interest.
By the end of 2012 all but one had left and
a few months later the site was gone.
They never heard from Cicada again.
One of the two winners, named Marcus Wanner, later
elaborated further in a video by YouTuber Nox Populi.
Furthermore, Nox Populi himself claims to
be a winner of the second puzzle so I reached
out to him and this is some of what he had
to say.
After completing the final stages of the second
puzzle Nox Populi received an invitation to
join Cicada 3301.
However, he was not invited to a website but
was instead merely told to be patient.
Then, around May of 2013, all communication
with Cicada abruptly ceased.
This was around the same time as when the
website dedicated to the winners of the first
puzzle was suddenly taken down.
Nox Populi later contacted other winners of
the second puzzle to compare notes and their
experiences were identical.
In his own words:
"All the stories were the same, we were invited
to join 3301, then something happened and
silence followed a request for patience."
Nox Populi suppose that roughly five others
completed the second puzzle in contrast to
the twenty-odd winners of the first.
In regards to who or what Cicada is, Nox Populi
believes they could be a remnant of the cypherpunk
movement of the late 80s and 90s.
Essentially a small group of activists advocating
widespread use of strong cryptography and
privacy-enhancing technologies but he admits
that there is no way to know for certain.
If you want a far more comprehensive walkthrough
of these puzzles as opposed to my brief overview,
Nox Populi has produced a number of videos
on his channel which I highly recommend.
While these accounts cannot be verified they
do make for a very compelling argument as
to what Cicada is.
A group of anonymous developers seeking to
develop privacy-conscious applications by
recruiting talented individuals via cryptographic
puzzles.
Sure, it is not nearly as exciting as a shadow
government seeking world domination or any
of the more fantastical theories but it is
certainly more plausible.
You have to keep in mind that no part of these
puzzles would have required more than one person.
The posters are often pointed to as evidence
that this must be the work of some international
organization but I beg to differ.
I mean, right now, I could use any number
of services to hire random persons around
the globe to install posters for me.
Although, given that no poster was located
more than an hour away from an airport leads
me to believe that one or multiple persons
actually traveled to these locations.
I mean, some of the posters were found within
walking distance of an international airport.
The fact is that anyone with a disposable
income and enough time on their hands would
be able to create the illusion of a vast secret
network spanning the globe.
Not saying that is the case with Cicada 3301 but it is
nonetheless a possibility that cannot be discounted.
With all of that being said, I personally
think a loose-knit group of privacy-minded
hobby-cryptographers to be the most plausible
explanation.
Cicada made their last public statement in
April of 2017, merely warning against disinformation,
but the current status of the third puzzle
and the possibility of a fourth
remains clouded in mystery.

hello Internet welcome to film theory
the show that aims to put the science
back into science fiction but first I
wanted to take a minute to just talk
about excuse me no I don't think this is
universal we wanted Rick well look at
what we have here folks it seems like
some rogue visitors may have just opened
up a transdimensional gateway into my
living room can I help you uh we're
looking for dimension c-130 - you
wouldn't happen to know where that is
located
sorry guys our universes classification
number is D 27:31 but while we're on the
topic you're technically using the word
dimension incorrectly you see dimensions
define elements of physical space I'm
sure you're familiar with the elements
of height with potentially depth the hue
seem to be just as flat as I am whereas
oh we got a talker here you know what
just just stop don't point that at me
I'm just trying to help you guys sorry
not sorry for trying to be helpful oh my
god shut up this guy never stops talking
just just just just just get out of the
spaceship oh and by the way no one over
the age of 7 thinks the animatronics are
scary either so so take that well that
was rude now the question is how do I
get home Oh Rick and Morty's portal gun
shoot this thing at any surface and you
open up a green circular portal to
practically any location oh here I come
second time's the charm
this has got to be just a coincidence
okay
it does not take a big brain to Rick and
Morty fan to understand that this thing
might be a little bit broken so I guess
I gotta figure out how this thing works
but how do you fix a piece of technology
like this I mean the science contained
in this thing is so sought after that
the Galactic Federation infiltrated
Rick's brain in the hopes of uncovering
its secrets I guess in that respect then
I'm a little like the Galactic
Federation because today is gonna be all
about me trying to figure out how Rick's
portal gun actually works let's start by
picking apart what we do know about the
portal gun our first real glimpse into
the detailed workings of the portal gun
happens during the audience's first
encounter with the council of ricks
where we learn that much like your
internet browser the portal gun keeps a
detailed list of all the locations its
users visited come on don't look at
another man's portal gun history we all
go to weird places later in the series
and elsewhere in the Citadel we learned
that the portal gun relies on some sort
of fluid I want a portal gun with enough
fluid to take me off this prison a fluid
that if replaced with an incorrect
bootleg tends to create portals with
some unfortunate side effects this fluid
may in some ways be connected to the
number of times that the gun can
actually be used to create portals in
both the show's pilot episode as well as
the episode get schwifty rick outright
mentions it having a limited charge I
spent so much time there my
interdimensional portal device it's got
no charge left there's only so much
charge left in this thing if we portal
home from here and back we're not gonna
have enough charge left to get offworld
then again it could all be lies because
Rick is lazy about the charge you were
just being lazy see told you but by far
the most interesting property of the
portal gun is its ability to open
portals to well just about anywhere not
just within our own universe but between
universes Rick seems to use his portal
gun to travel within the universe pretty
frequently for example in the episode
raising desorbs orb Rick and summer used
the portal gun to teleport to the planet
gazorpazorp but after the portal gun
gets smashed on the planet they're
forced to use
spaceship to travel back to earth this
proves that gazorpazorp and earth are in
the same universe far apart though they
may be but throughout the series various
Rick's use their respective portal guns
to visit other parallel universes and
it's that second property that seems to
set Rick's portal gun apart from all the
other existing Galactic Federation
technology we get confirmation of this
in the season 3 premiere Rick shank
redemption when it's revealed that the
Federation is using a brain eliezer on
Rick to discover the secrets of
interdimensional travel should we go
straight to the moment I discovered
interdimensional travel whoa your little
flappy doodles are twitching again the
key word here is interdimensional
interdimensional travel is travel
between dimensions while intron
dimensional travel would be travel
within a dimension the Galactic
Federation already has teleporter
technology it's the blue portal that we
see in the pilot episode what they want
is the ability to travel to other
universes the green portal technology
and heck life wouldn't they want this
when you open up one of these babies
literally anything can fall out of them
you know I remember when that used to be
fun see hey that diet I was on it seemed
to be working
wait a minute you you look familiar
you're Neil deGrasse Tyson your personal
astrophysicist I uh I would love to
continue this totally real conversation
that is in no way a forced narrative
construct to explain your presence on
the show right now but you see I have a
malfunctioning portal gun here that I
need to repair in order to get home you
think you could help me out here Neil
sure but only for a short while my
quantum stability in this universe is
weak and getting weaker by the minute
no is that really true nah it's just a
line I use to get out of conversations
that are running too long Matt that how
did you know my name
narrative construct remember Yeah right
now if you hope to use those portals to
get back home the first thing you have
to do is to clarify whether you're
invoking a true multiverse or the
many-worlds interpretation of quantum
mechanics the many-worlds interpretation
asserts that whenever an event occurs
that could have multiple outcomes the
universe branches into as many copies as
are necessary to enable all outcomes at
the same time Oh kind of like in that
episode of Rick and Morty
Rick potion number nine which shows our
dynamic duo entering new universes that
are extremely similar to their own in
this case they escaped from their
original
universe when rick is unable to cure a
genetic epidemic by going into a brand
new universe where rick does manage to
create the cure two worlds branched out
from one core decision correct but only
if you needed it to explain that one
scene in rick potion number nine but it
wouldn't explain lizard morty or hammer
head morty you get that from the
multiverse hypothesis which states that
there are many perhaps infinitely many
big bangs that each started their own
universes they all coexist and because
they each had their own beginning they
could have completely different laws of
physics or completely different Morty's
as opposed to many worlds where you're
always starting with the same base rules
and regulations so well the many-worlds
interpretation could explain similar
earth-like worlds like we see in rick
potion it wouldn't explain some of the
other universes that we see in the show
like pizzas that sit in chairs and use
their phones to order people or phones
that sit on pizza and use their people
to order chairs or chairs who sit on
people and use their pizzas to order
phones right exactly and in the
multiverse hypothesis each of those
parallel universes coexist with our own
universe but since the laws of physics
can be different it would be extremely
dangerous to visit them the molecular
forces that hold your body together
could be compromised in the presence of
different physical laws
you might just spontaneously collapse
into a pile of goo so does that mean
rick's portal gun is all fiction and no
science we'll never be able to visit
alternate universes well we can't say
it's impossible to reach other universes
because we're limited by our own
understanding of the laws of physics
last year you might have seen the
headline scientists are attempting to
open portal to a parallel universe
just some over-the-top clickbait right
clickable yes over-the-top
no it's less step through a gate into an
evil alternative universe where there
copies of us with evil mustaches and
more like set up a magnetic field to see
if we can capture neutrons that had
briefly traveled through an alternative
universe what does that even mean though
well there are a lot of strange things
going on in our universe that might
possibly be explained by the existence
of other universes
in this particular
case the scientists are looking at why
certain neutrons are decaying at
different speeds than expected so it may
be possible to enter alternate universes
but how I'm sorry Matt Pat but my
quantum state is weakening good bye good
bye
what adapter I hate when quantum states
give bad reception stupid flat Pat why
did you ask the important questions
first
curse my propensity for a long gating
watch time all right I guess that means
I got to solve this one myself unless
the portal gun has one more charge in at
show me Bill Nye no okay all right what
would this be how would portal guns work
it's got to be wormholes right I mean in
science fiction it is always wormholes
and honestly it's something that we
already see consistently throughout this
series in the world leaderly conspiracy
Rick and Jerry's trip back to earth
involves a hop through a large ship
sized wormhole when I say trip and
really mean trip then in the more recent
episode never ricky morty we briefly see
rick working in a lab and in the
background there's a blackboard that has
a diagram of various wormholes that has
got to be yet see one of the things that
albert einstein changed about our
understanding is that space and time are
bendy and inc machine sorry
no stay focused matt or universe can be
conceived of like a large flat flexible
plane if that sheet were bent in the
right way it would be possible for a
wormhole to connect two points that are
at very different points in space a
major shortcut allowing you to reach
places across the plane faster than if
you had to go the normal route faster
than even the way that light travels
this shortcut in effect allows you to
travel faster than the speed of light
but these same bends in the fabric of
space described by Einstein's theory of
relativity could in principle also
create a wormhole connecting two
separate universes in the multiverse
I've done it I am a genius the gods a
weap as they look down upon me home here
I come but wait that that's just the
principle of how it could potentially
happen in theory in quantum physics
theory but but not actually how it
happens in practicality sure Rick's
portal gun could be creating wormholes
that connect his current point in the
fabric of space with other points in our
verse or other universes but how would
it be able to do this it must have
something to do with the portal fluid
that's what's giving it the energy or
charge that it needs to open up these
massive rifts in time and space portal
fluid obviously isn't the thing in real
life though so what in space could
potentially have enough energy for
folding the fabric of reality enough and
punching holes through it concentrated
dark matter concentrated dark matter
concentrated hot right the Galactic
Federation isn't the only group of
aliens trying to get information from
Rick's genius brain the Zygerrians are
also trying to get information from him
and what they're looking for might
actually be the same thing as what the
Galactic Federation is looking for in
the episode M night Shyamalan
concentrated dark matter is explained as
being necessary for accelerated space
travel the fuel for accelerated space
travel that makes it sound like some
kind of fuel that you'd be using to
power a spaceship but what is inner
Universal travel if not really really
accelerated travel through space using a
wormhole as a shortcut to get from one
point of space to another and whereas
Dark Matter may be full of energy
concentrated dark matter would be even
more powerful more energy dense could be
that portal fluid is just a form of dark
matter that rick has somehow been able
to harness I mean 85% of our universe is
dark matter and dark matter is the stuff
in our universe that we can observe -
it's certainly possible that this matter
unseen by us humans could have all sorts
of unusual properties properties that
could yield us limitless amounts of
energy there it is forgot my hot cocoa
Neil I figured it out the answer is
concentrated dark matter but what
exactly is dark matter can it be
concentrated and why is so much of our
universe made up of it well I'd love to
answer all those questions for you I'm
well my quantum signal is still weak at
least until I've had my morning hot
cocoa so if you and your viewers want
the recipe to Rick's secret concentrated
dark matter you're just going to have to
come over to my Startalk channel and
while they're there can you encourage
them to subscribe we're really close to
a million subscribers a number you guys
passed long ago but it'd be nice to get
that gold YouTube play button by the way
nearly all the gold in Earth's crust
came from metallic meteorites that
bombarded the planet 200
million years after it formed so your
million subscriber YouTube play button
is actually a little piece of space
hanging on your wall
very cool let's go I'll break the fourth
wall right now to encourage them to
click the box that they see on screen
right now to show our other video that
we did together all about concentrated
dark matter I'll also put a link in the
description to our video together so
they can follow us on over there watch
our video together on Rick and Morty's
dark matter and while you're over at the
start auction I'll hit the subscribe
button let's push Neil over a million
subscribers he's already almost there
and if we were able to do it for him it
would probably make him think that we're
really cool and he'd probably be more
inclined to reveal all the secrets of
the universe just for us well I'm sure
he'd probably want to reveal them to
everyone but let's just say just for us
and remember when it comes to Rick and
Morty and even some astrophysics it's
all just a theory a film theory and
hopped through the portal on screen
right now for more Rick and Morty action

It's more expensive to live in Hong Kong
than anywhere in the world.
Hong Kong has
been ranked the least affordable housing
market in the world eight years in a row
and by a long shot.
Housing prices are now almost 20 times
more than annual income. That means that
a household making $50,000 USD
would on average be looking for
a house that cost $980,000 USD.
And it's getting really bad.
Hundreds of thousands of
residents now squeeze into incredibly
small apartments, most of them no bigger
than a parking space. So these are cage
homes, which basically fit one person
and their belongings. And they basically
stack these in a room in order to fit
as many people as they can in the room.
And yet the price per square foot for
these smaller houses just keeps shooting
up.
I visited these homes to try to piece
together an explanation for this trend
and to meet the people who are being
squeezed by the world's least affordable
real estate market.
There are now tens of thousands of
people in this city who live in spaces
that are between 75 and 140 square feet.
For some perspective a typical parking
space in the US is 120 square feet.
One of the most common strategies for small space living
is this subdivided house model. This big space that's been
divided up into a bunch of tiny little
living spaces.
These people basically
have room for a bed and a table and a
few belongings.
What makes this model work is that they have a bigger
communal space where they're able to
have their cooking and their washing and
the bathroom open to everyone, so that
they can save space and save money in
their actual living quarters.
So this is
the kitchen for this space which is
shared by four families.
The tempting
explanation here for why the prices are
so high is land scarcity. You know, seven and a half million people crammed into this
series of islands, it's gonna drive up
the prices. The same story in a lot of
places that have run out of land that
are in high demand — in San Francisco or
New York City.
Okay this might be the
story in New York City and San Francisco,
but is Hong Kong actually running out of
land? Let's see what the drone says about
this.
Flying over Hong Kong you start to
see that, while yes, there's a very dense
urban landscape, there's also a whole lot
of green space.
Government land-use data
says that 75 percent of the land in Hong
Kong is not developed. Now some of that
is mountainous and rocky and not easy to
build on, but certainly not all of it.
So I posed this question about density
to two experts, one is a Hong Kong
citizen and the other is a 30-plus year
resident. Both are advocates for better
urban design.
Are high prices primarily
the result of land scarcity?
No.
No.
There's a land-use issue, because also
land is being inefficiently used or
conserved.
The problem isn't the shortage
of land the problem is bad land management.
Land use, land management, what
these experts are referring to is that
of all the land in Hong Kong only 3.7% is zoned for urban housing.
But it's not because of
mountains, it's because of policy and
this gets to the heart of the
explanation of why more and more people
are living in homes the size of parking
spaces.
The first thing to note if you
want to understand the real explanation,
is that the government owns all of the
land in Hong Kong. Well, all except for
this one church that the British built
here when they ruled it back in the 1800s
and it kind of just escaped the whole
government-owns-all-the-land thing.
So the government owns all the land and it
leases it out to developers, usually for
50 years in an auction process where the
highest bidder gets the contract. With
such scarce and valuable land zoned for
housing, real estate companies more and
more of them coming from mainland China
with lots of money, will duke it out in
these auctions.
And will end up at an
astronomically high price.
Like this plot of land that was just
leased out for 2.2 billion dollars, which
set an all-time record for the most
expensive land of ever leased by the Hong
Kong government to a developer. So the
way the government zones and leases
land is the first part of this. The other
part of this explanation has a lot to do
with taxes. If you're the type of person
who navigates away from this video when
you hear the word tax policy,
stay with me here.
This place loves low
taxes. It's a great place to do business,
because the corporate tax is low
no value-added tax, no sales tax, free
market economics, low taxes. That's
embedded into the fabric of this place.
Look at all those low taxes doing their
work, building up those skyscrapers,
slapping on those bank logos all over
town.
So if the government isn't getting revenue
from taxes, it really needs it from
another source and in the case of Hong Kong
that source is land sales.
A lot of the government revenues here
driven by land revenues and it's about 30% of government public financing income.
The government of Hong Kong can
lease out this land to developers at
astronomical prices, make a ton of
revenue from that and not have to raise
taxes on the people or the corporations
that reside here and they still proudly
retain their ranking
as the freest economy on earth.
What this
means is that the Hong Kong government
doesn't have a huge incentive to free up
more land and lower prices, but while
this current arrangement of bidding and
auctions is really good for revenue for
the government and good for the market
generally, it's not super good for the
people of Hong Kong.
Of all the small spaces,
this is easily the most cramped. These are
coffin homes.
Could I ask you just a
quick question about your living space?
The government is slowly working on this
problem.
Year after year new policies come in
that are meant to fix this, but they're
slow to change, mainly because they have
an incentive to keep the status quo as
it is.
Out here at this industrial
complex in Hong Kong, I met with a guy
named Eric Wong, a local inventor and
businessman who has seen a business
opportunity in the midst of this space
crisis.
Eric grew up in Hong Kong and has been
thinking about small-space living for a
long time.
Oh it has WiFi.
These capsules come in one or two-person sizes
and are meant to provide a more
efficient and hygienic version of the
cage and coffin homes, all at a
relatively low price.
Down here there's a
little box where you can put all your
valuables and so there's mirror lights, there's
reading lights.
But these capsules,
innovative as they are, really just put a
band-aid on this housing problem.
They don't serve as a real solution.
A real solution would need to come from
something that's much less profitable
and fun to look at:
Government policy and
zoning reform that will free up more
land and put the interests of the people
above the interests of the market, but
until the government can make that
happen people in Hong Kong will continue
to squeeze into smaller and smaller
spaces.

In elementary school
I had this classmate who came from a poor family
This kid had to attend school during the day
And help his single father with work at night
Unsurprisingly
He wasn't very good at school works
So, one day, after failing an exam
Our headteacher openly insulted him
She called him, and I quote:
"A bastard without a mother"
That was not an isolating incident
The most frustrating thing is
There was no place for us to complain against her
Our parents only asked our teachers about us
And rarely asked us about our teachers
So, her toxic behaviors continued until we graduated
But that was nothing
Compare to what I have to show you today
Silenced is a 2011 South Korean drama film
Based on true events that took place
At a school for children with hearing impairments
And nothing
Nothing will prepare you for what you're about to hear
It is one of the most gut-wrenching movies I have ever watched
But it is also one of the most important films ever made
In the history of Korean cinema
It's a heavy movie
But I want us all to face the heavy issue
So, let me show you the story of
Silenced
[The Film That Changed South Korea]
[Chapter One]
"Why are you going to Ja-ae Academy?"
"To teach kids"
In-ho is a newly hired art teacher at Ja-ae Academy
Where he teaches children with hearing impairments
(Awarded Best School in Mujin)
And despite his best effort to be friendly
The students all keep themselves at a distance
We meet Yeon-doo
A girl who's always cold and closed off
Yoo-ri
An absent-minded girl who's always eating
And Min-su
A boy who shows up in class late With bruises on his face
The film spends a good deal of time building up a mystery
It's suspicious
But, for a moment
Assume you don't know the premise of the film
"Min-su?"
"His younger brother died in a train accident a few days ago"
These are also perfectly common behaviors for children
Boys being boys, right?
"A disability in body"
"Leads to an impairment in mentality"
Our protagonist, being a good teacher
Try to look into their files
To see what their problems are
And this is the insidious part:
What "THEIR PROBLEMS" are
"An orphan?"
It's so easy to believe a problematic child is problematic
Due to their own fault
That night
In-ho heard a crying voice coming from the school bathroom
"Is someone in there?"
But then...
The security stops him
"Kids here make strange noises for fun"
It's just easier to believe the adults are the trustworthy authorities
And the children are the problematic ones
Even the best of intentions often aren't enough
To combat this inherent bias
In-ho walks away
Nothing will prepare you for what you'll see next
[Chapter Two]
Trigger warning for violent abuse against children
"Stand straight"
"Keep your manner even when getting hit"
That is how Min-su got his bruises
"Mr. Park"
"What's the matter?"
We only ever ask teachers about children
And rarely ask children about their teachers
"This kid sneaked out of residence last night"
"With two girls at that"
But when we do ask children for their stories
We may realize the world is much different
From their perspective
And it is a shocking perspective
Trigger warning for...
Sexual assault against children
"Yeon-du was..."
"Molested"
"By the principal"
From Yeon-du's words
We get to see the rotten side of the school
We learn that there were multiple assailants
With many victims
"Is someone in there?"
"The cops sent the kids who went to report it back to the school"
"That's why they were beaten"
With the children's testimony
They seek help from the authorities at the Office of Education
"After school?"
"That's not our jurisdiction"
They go to the police
"How can we handcuff him"
"Based on what some deaf kids say?"
And this is how evil persists
When good people do nothing
It seems very exaggerated
But this is exactly why victims of domestic abuse
Don't often seek help
In a survey published by the National Domestic Violence Hotline
Nearly half of the surveyed victims of domestic violence
Felt discriminated against by the police
2 in 3 women who contacted the police
Are afraid to call the police in the future
And the number one reason being
"The police would not believe them or would do nothing"
And, perhaps the worst statistic of them all
1 in 4 women was arrested or threatened with arrest
For reporting incidents or sexual assault or abuse
We all love to express outrage against abuse
But the reality is
Even you and I are not as ready to help as we think
When In-ho first witnesses his colleague violently assaults Min-su
In-ho, too, fails to act
It's physical punishment
A bit extreme, but...
Not that bad... right?
We have this bias towards authority figures
In this case, we trust the teacher
More than a problematic child
We don't know who's the bad guy
So we choose not to act
"Mr. Park"
"What's the matter?"
We really should've stopped the fight
Instead of asking questions
Evil persists
Because we do nothing
"Just like the kids you teach"
"Close your ears and mouth and just do your job"
Thankfully, News media picks up the story
The case goes to court
But the nightmare has just begun
[Chapter Three]
"Do not forgive those evil forces who frame our elders!"
At the trial
We get to see how the judicial system operates
"Privileges of former post"
In South Korean
There is an informal rule called "privileges of former post"
When a retired judge or a public prosecutor
Go on to become a lawyer in private practice
They can receive special treatments
"Retired judges are given a favorable ruling"
"At their first trial in practice"
Unsurprisingly, the defense lawyer is a former judge
Witness tampering
The defense calls in two witnesses
Both of which lied in their testimony
The security guard can't afford to lose his job
Meaning it is in his best interests to help the principal
The doctor who examined the victims
Claimed that the victims do not appear to be sexually assaulted
She's also connected to the principal
Settle out of court
"The prosecutor said molestation of kids at or above 13"
"Can be annulled if they settle with the victim's parents"
Perhaps unsurprisingly
Living in poverty
The parents of some children
Accepted the settlements
"Min-su's grandmother saw the money"
"And signed right away"
"Who forgave him?"
"I didn't forgive him!"
Turns out
The judicial system isn't there to help vulnerable people
It's just a game to be won
Just like the individual in the system
The system itself is also apathetic
The lack of empathy can be seen here
"Which one took off your clothes and hurt you?"
"All three"
Victims have to expose their painful memories in public
Just for a chance to see some justice
Not to mention, this
"Is it possible for such a young girl"
"And a man to have sexual relations?"
"Even if it was, without the girl's voluntary consent"
"It's impossible!"
This is the reality abuse victims have to
face
Everyone within this system is doing their job
But no one is helping
And these children
They cannot hear or speak without the help of others
Their voices are silenced
Luckily
The prosecution dismantled all witness testimony
And brought in irrefutable evidence
Every single accused is convicted
And they all received
Probation...
Evil prevails
[Conclusion]
"I was there when she was being abused"
"Is someone in there?"
"But..."
"I didn't help"
If there is a movie that changed the world
This is it
Two months after the film came out
The school in question was finally shut down
The case was reopened
And the school administrator was sentenced to 12 years in prison
For sexually assaulting an 18-year-old student
That same year
South Korea passed a bill named after this film
Abolishing the statute of limitations for sexual assaults
Against children under 13 and people with disabilities
The maximum sentence was also raised
But perhaps the most important thing this film did
Is to remind us of the darkness inside all of us
We, collectively, have not done a good job
Listening to the voices of children
The voices of the vulnerable
The voices of the helpless
As the film has shown
It is so easy to become part of a system
That enables abuser
All we need is to do nothing
This film changed South Korea
Because it changed people
It made people care
It made people reach out to the ones who need help
Hopefully, after you give it a watch
It'll change you
Into a better person, too

The wait is finally over, Salad Fingers, it's finally time.
P-pardon?
Time for part 2 of your theory.
Do it now.
Hello internet! Welcome to Film Theory.
And I hope you're ready because in honor
of Halloween, it's time we head once more
Into the twisted mind of Salad Fingers.
Last episode we stablished that Salad Fingers
Is set in the UK, during the year 1939
Trapped in his own mind and force to relieve various
Memories from World War 1
We also saw the recurring theme of Salad Fingers
Feeling trapped by, and abandoning babies
And how his fractured mind constantly
hops between different personalities.
But, what does it all mean? How do these
individuals pieces add up to one overall
narrative, and, What the heck does the ending mean?
You had to wait long enough
So let's not waste any more time, let's get right into it.
When looking at the 10 episodes
of Salad Fingers, there's a definite
shift midway through the series, the first
five episodes are filled with bizarre
moments, unexplained events, strange
characters and veiled plotlines, but
it's in episode 6 "present" that things
start to feel weightier, much more
intentional, it's this episode that makes
it clear that the random, disturbing
moments sprinkled through the series
aren't just there for shock value, but
rather possess a deeper meaning, crucial
to unraveling the plot of it all.
The episode revolves around the first of the
finger puppets, Jeremy Fisher, giving the
titular present of a horse to Salad
Fingers, a gift that seems completely
arbitrary, until we see old Horace
Horsecollar appear again in one of the
final and most gruesome moments from the
series. Episode Ten's visit to Dr. Papanak,
where the doctor is launched
through the air and latches onto the
side of the horse, tearing into it's stomach.
As an animal lover, it's brutal to watch as
the horse stares at Salad Fingers and cries.
So clearly, these moments are highly
symbolic, but symbolic of what, exactly?
Let's hop back into episode 6, to figure
it out. Jeremy Fisher appears and Salad
greets him by saying:
"Jeremy Fisher!
I thought you were out fighting the great war!"
So apparently it's a surprise to see
that Jeremy has returned home from the
war so early, but this is a line that
takes on a whole new tone just a few
minutes later when in the same episode
Salad repeats it again. "Jeremy Fisher,
I thought you were out fighting the Great War."
Things have gotten serious in a hurry. But why
is Salad Fingers suddenly so aggressive
towards Jeremy? To truly understand that...
we need to first piece together their
conversation and piece together is an
accurate description because believe it
or not, the conversation happens in two
chunks separated out and removed from
one another. One side of the conversation
happens when Salad is out playing with
Horace Horsecollar at the local toilet,
and the second half is in the house
directed at the finger puppet. What
seems like two fragmented streams of
thoughts, when spliced together actually
gives us one completed conversation
between Jeremy and an angry father. Both
played by Salad Fingers' fractured mind/
Here it is properly laid out:
"Jeremy Fisher, I thought you were out
fighting the Great War."
"P-pardon?"
"I'd like a word with you."
"I don't understand."
"I'm not one for accusations, but this
one's cast iron."
"What is this?"
"I've seen you tailgating my daughter
with aspirations of deflowering her rose."
"N-no this isn't true. You've got the
wrong bloke, squire."
"I don't make mistakes comrade this one's textbook."
Flash to Salad Fingers eating a version of
himself, and you're left with
crystal-clear storytelling ladies and
gentlemen. I don't know about you but it
makes so much more sense now...
...Yeah right. What we see in this pivotal
moment from the series is a
father-figure actively threatening a
former soldier, Jeremy, for trying to
seduce and deflower his daughter.
Deflower, you know, take a roll in the hay with her,
create the beast with two backs, break
out the old horizontal mambo.. Alright,
enough of- Roast the old hot dog.
I'm done. Remember, this is Salad
rehashing past memories. So the fact that
he eats his puppet in the end or
cannibalizes the head of some other
Salad Fingers seems to indicate that
this conversation didn't quite end all
that well for Jeremy. Most likely with
the father killing him.
Extreme, maybe, but it seems like the
father's fears about Jeremy might have
been well-founded. You see, think for a
minute about the horse Jeremy gives to
Salad, and then remember the fact that it
appears again in a doctor's office to
have its stomach ripped out. Knowing what
we know about the accusations against
Jeremy, let's say for a second that he is
indeed trying to deflower this young
girl.And what's more that he succeeds in
doing so. Under this context Jeremy
giving Salad Fingers the present of a
horse is symbolic of him getting the
girl pregnant.
Likewise, that means she would need to go
see a doctor to have things taken care
of. Be it giving birth, or on the flipside,
having the baby aborted. And that's the
memory we see Salad relive in episode 10
as at the doctor's office Salad once
again flips through
a couple personalities where he starts as the
girl getting examined by the doctor.
"I suppose you'll be checking me for nimpers,
and camel spots."
a girl who really
enjoys her examination a whole lot,
before snapping into a new persona.This
time, that of the mother encouraging her
daughter while the baby is being born.
"I know it hurts, just try and sit still whilst
the doctor eats your blood."
Ah, the miracle of childbirth at the
hands of the swiss army knife doctor. And
for as gruesome as this scene is, we can
confidently say that she gives birth,
since the title of this episode is
"Birthday". So we're now left with the
million-dollar question- Whose birthday
is it?
Why, it's none other than our good friend,
the second and most crucial finger puppet,
Hubert Cumberdale. There are actually
plenty of hints to confirm this.
Sprinkled throughout the videos not only
does Salad Fingers tell us at the
beginning of episode 10 that it is
Hubert's birthday today,
"As it's Hubert's birthday"
but also in a very short scene after the
doctor's visit,  we see the important
visual of Hubert being abandoned on the
ground surrounded by branches. Know as I
covered last episode, baby imagery is
everywhere in this series. Especially
babies being abandoned. With Mr. Branches
from episode 9 being one of the
strongest examples. So to depict Hubert
lying there amongst a bunch of broken
branches, all while a tree has somehow
grown between Salad Fingers' legs is an
important visual symbol Hubert is
clearly the baby. But there are other hints
sprinkled throughout the series as well.
For instance in episode 8 Salad adopting
the voice of a scolding parent kicks
Hubert off the bed into a tray of muck,
saying:
"Scrub that muck off at once, Hubert Cumberdale. I'll have no dirty immigrants
in my house."
It's not just an insult, it's pointed to
the fact that Hubert was born of a black
father, Jeremy Fisher, which during the
World War One era was a big deal.
This was a time in history when
immigration into the UK was on the rise,
due to the war as a result what's known
as scientific racism flourished a time in
which white Europeans used false
scientific claims to prove that they
were the superior race. Things like
saying that the Caucasian brain was
anatomically larger than other races, or
relating facial structure to overall
intelligence. That coupled with the
increased immigration caused by the war,
resulted in attitudes like the one Salad
Fingers expresses in this moment. It's a
key point of seeing Hubert ostracized by
his own family because of his parentage.
It's even reflected in the way Hubert
tastes. In episode 2, we see that Hubert
"Ew, you taste like soot and poo."
Again indicating a different status than
someone like Marjory, who tastes like
"Sunshine dust."
Hubert is simply considered
dirty or unclean. Well how does this all fit with the ending? As
a refresher Salad Fingers encounters a
table with five other salad finger
looking creatures except each is
physically mutilated in some way. At the head
of the table is a sixth chair. Empty, and
presumably for him.
Salad is visibly uncomfortable at first,
until the mysterious pole lowers down
with a gift a hat made out of the
remains of the now-dead Milford Cubicle.
The present makes him feel at home, and
series ends with him saying in triumph:
"I shall wear it from here to the grave. What a truly special day" So WTF?
Seriously, we just saw a horse get ripped
apart, and now this is our big ending?
Well, yes actually, and here's why. Salad
Fingers is Hubert Cumberdale. The child
born out of wedlock that never found his
place. Always being ostracized by a
family that never wanted him in the
first place. And this ending shows that
he finally feels as though he's found
acceptance, a place where he fits in.
He's found his family. Granted, it's a
family of deformed mutants who don't
actually acknowledge his existence,
but hey, it's enough for him and who am I to
take that away from our little green
hero.
So first we know that Hubert and Salad
Fingers are one in the same. Well, it's
worth noting that after the doctor's scene
in the forest, Hubert as we discussed
gets left behind.
Suddenly, when Salad Fingers is back at the
house, the birthday party is no longer
for Hubert. It's for him. He's the one the
presents are for. And he's also the one
excited about how the other guests
remembered him on his big day.
"For me? I thought you'd all forgotten!" It's also worth
noting that randomly Hubert is wearing a
top hat in this episode. And what gift does
Salad get at the very end of the video? A
similar-looking top hat. But it goes
beyond that. The Hubert puppet is also the
only one to be able to change form.
Becoming black goo that burns to the
touch.
Unlike the other finger puppets, this one
is supernatural. A construct of Salad
Fingers' mind. Unlike the other characters,
which are more grounded in reality.
Hubert is also seen the most, and is one
that we see in life size scale multiple
times. Even sharing Salad's own memories.
But despite all of this, he also tends to
only interact with Salad Fingers' true
personality.
None of the other characters that Salad
Fingers hops between
both Marjory and Jeremy interact with
other personalities. The angry father, the
disappointed husband. But Hubert seems
mostly connected to the true
Salad Fingers. So if that's all the case
then it makes sense why this ending is
so moving for Fingers. In episode 8, we
see just how lonely he is. So much so,
that he keeps a memorial of hairs. Five
different hairs- each one a different
shade and color.
"You all look so beautiple together. A gay little quintette."
They're mementos of his lost
family. At the end of the episode he's
forced to get rid of them. Something that
is so devastating, that he ends the
episode by crying in the corner of his
safety cover. So we have five hairs, but
also five different people at that final
table. Coincidence? I think not.
In the end, I have no solid proof. But I
can only assume that this scene is meant
to be Salad Fingers being reunited with
the five people in his life who have
abandoned him in some way. People who
have either died, or disowned him. Scenes
that we've witnessed across the series.
Some combination of the father figure we
saw in episode four who fled to France afraid
of being caged by a baby.
Kenneth, his younger brother from "Shore Leave"
who either died young, or during the
Great War Auntie Bainbridge. Probably
represented by the gray hair. And the
most likely candidate for the voice of
Roger the radio. A woman cold and
unforgiving to Salad Fingers as he was
growing up.
Marjory Stuart Baxter, Salad's wife from
episode 9. The wife who left him to care for
their baby alone. And then Ivan, the baby
he just didn't know how to handle and
had to give away. Maybe even his mother
who, if the episode 10 doctor's
appointment is any indication,
potentially died in childbirth. Five
hair,s and five lost loved ones.
Run away, dead, or disappointed. Leaving
Salad Fingers, or should I say Hubert, alone.
In his made-up reality. Stuck in time and
trapped in his own unforgiving wasteland.
That's why the final moment is so
important.Tthe platoon is all there and
the gift he's given is a hat. A friend hat,
like the one he gave to Hubert back in
episode 5. He's finally accepted. He's
found his place at the table.
IIt's as though Salad Fingers has finally
come to grips with who he is, leaving the
puppet behind in the woods, and being
born again into his true role as
Hubert. So the episode titled "Birthday"
Actually has a double meaning.Green
monsters deserve some love too.
What a truly special day.
But hey that's just a theory, A film
theory..... Aaaaandd cut!
Oh and full disclosure, I still have no
idea what's the deal with Milford
Cubicle, or why it's his skin making the
friend hat. Maybe it's just a remnant of
the real world poking in. I don't know, I'm a theorist, I'm not a miracle worker.

You can't deny his offensive output.
He can play.
And we need people that can play.
Who do you wanna talk about first?
None of them.
Billy, we got 38 home runs,
120 RBIs to make up for.
Guys, you're still trying
to replace Giambi.
I told you we can't do it,
and we can't do it.
Now, what we might be able to do
is re-create him.
-Re-create him in the aggregate.
-The what?
Giambi's on-base percentage
was .477.
Damon's on-base, .324.
And Olmedo's was .291.
Add that up and you get....
Do you want me to speak?
When I point at you, yeah.
-1.092.
-Divided by three.
-.364.
-That's what we're looking for.
Three ballplayers-- Three ballplayers
whose average OBP is....
.364.
-Wait, that doesn't come out right.
-It's right, Artie.
-Billy.
-You gotta carry the one.
-Billy.
-Scratch this out.
-Yeah?
-Who's that?
That's Pete.
-Does Pete really need to be here?
-Yes, he does.
Okay, here's who we want.
Number one:
Jason's little brother, Jeremy.
-Oh, God.
-Billy, that's trouble.
Billy, look, if I-- Yeah.
Billy, if I may,
he has had his problems off the field...
...and we know what he can't do
on the field.
He's getting thick around the waist.
There's reports about him on weed,
in strip clubs.
His on-base percentage
is all we're looking at now.
And Jeremy gets on base an awful lot
for a guy who only costs 285,000.
-Jeez, Billy--
-Number two:
-David Justice.
-Oh, no.
-His legs are gone.
-Not a good idea.
-Old Man Justice?
-Why is that?
Steinbrenner's so pissed
at his decline...
...he's willing to eat his contract
to get rid of him.
-Exactly.
-Ten years ago, Justice, big name.
Been in big games.
He's gonna really help
our season tickets early in the year...
...but in the dog days in July, August,
we're lucky if he's gonna hit his weight.
Billy, his legs are gone,
and he's a defensive liability.
I question
whether the bat speed's there.
-His legs are gone.
-Grady.
We'll be lucky to get 60 games
out of him. Why do you like him?
Because he gets on base.
-What is this?
-What are we doing?
Okay, number three:
-Scott Hatteberg.
-Who?
-Hatteberg?
-Exactly.
He sounds like an Oakland A
already.
-Yes, he's had a little problem with--
-Little problem? He can't throw.
He's a career .260 hitter.
The best part of his career is over.
-It's just getting started.
-Boston wants to cut him.
-No one wants to pick him up.
-Good. He's cheap.
Let me get this straight.
You're gonna get a guy...
...that's been released
by half the organizations in baseball...
...because he's got nonrepairable nerve
damage in his elbow and can't throw.
He can't throw and he can't field.
But what can he do?
Oh, boy.
Check your reports
or I'm gonna point at Pete.
-He gets on base.
-He can get on base.
-So he walks a lot.
-He gets on base a lot, Rocco.
Do I care if it's a walk or a hit?
Pete?
-You do not.
-I do not.
I got 37 free agents
that are better than those three guys.
Wait a minute,
let me get this straight.
So you're not gonna bring in one...
...but three defective players
to replace Giambi?
You're not buying into
this Bill James bullshit?
This is the new direction of the A's.
We are card counters
at the blackjack table...
...and we're gonna turn the odds
on the casino.
-I don't see it.
-Seriously, guys.
I think we have to remember
this is the man.
He answers to no one
except ownership and God.
And he doesn't have to answer
to us.
We make suggestions,
he makes decisions.
That's all fine and well, but we've been
working our asses off...
...for weeks to make this club better,
and you're shitting all over it.
This is not a discussion.
-What are we discussing?
-Barry, not a discussion.
Billy, man...
...there's one thing you're forgetting.
None of those three guys
knows how to play first base.
Well, you're gonna have
to teach one of them.
Teach?
Which one?

I don't think we have such a player type
like without the Alpha nahusa free yield
it was the third best player in the
world
Dominic ADEA it's a good finish if you
give me a chance you scoff you try for a
seder right clinical finishes look
promising start to the Chaya for a
football player often result in hype and
expectations from the media and the fans
this is more prevalent in Ghana where
talented youngsters are put under
instant scrutiny and are touted to be
the next big thing where the hype comes
in turns pressure and there are some who
thrive under this while the others who
feel away we look at seven Ghanaian
talents who feel to live up to the hype
generated around their new data lamda
came to the limelight in 1991 during the
FIFA under-17 World Cup in Italy grana
won the tournament and neo dartle auntie
was voted as the tournament's best
player until the ball stopped maybe you
take it away from him for the opening
the opening of the ball but when oh that
is having the ball and not like Ronnie
just running you know is very fast on
the ball the skills is there the speed
is there the power everything good at
ease you know when you're talking about
football that is also another player
that I don't think we have such a player
type like Oh Dottie from E going out I
don't think we have such a player with
like afternoon and all around you know
creative player by all standards with a
lot of energy a lot of pace
and a lot of football whipped I mean
this was somebody who back then you know
also drew a lot of confidence from the
fans I mean he struck a lot of
confidence with the football fans
anytime he had to wear the jersey for
Ghana Billy Sherrill pieces on him
describing him as his natural successor
sadly his career never matched the
promise he showed and became a gentleman
player in Europe now during this period
between the Netherlands and England was
where growth came and troubles also came
growth in the sense that he on every
occasion as he wore the shirt at PSV F
Coventry f you know at Aston Villa gave
further reason why he was named FIFA
under-17 best player in the world at
that time now fast forward he made some
very good money but unfortunately his
agents his managers you know gave him a
raw deal and of course because of the
relatively low levels of education on a
spot he ended up losing a lot of money I
would do Asaka nicknamed that Disco
Dancer
in 1995 soon after helping gonna to win
the under-17 World Championship
Misaka signed a contract at Belgian club
RSC underlit where he mainly played for
the aut he later joined exerts a hopping
Ghana to finish 4th position at FIFA
under-20 youth championship in 1997 in
Malaysia Halawa Asaka Croydon reached
the heights which he should have with
his prodigious talent he socket BOTS
national media attention as a schoolboy
and was healed as the next big hope for
the national team while he will point to
Talent it is undeniable that a
combination of injuries and bad luck has
meant that the talented player hasn't
been able to meet the expectations of
the media and fan
Placido say a silver Bovina with the
2007 World Cup under-17 squad in Korea
as well as v-neck in pain in a 2009
satellite World Cup winning team
following his experts at the 2007 and a
17 World Cup where he won the adidas

highest goalscorer with 8 goals coming
second by one go to McCulloch Chris
Santos of Nigeria he also had
unsuccessful things with blue fencing
Celtic and Asante Kotoko before
returning to South Africa to sign for
polokwane ECT in 2015 his time in lung
Papa was mad when in jeans and he
managed just three substitute appearance
during his time with polo chronic
[Music]
a wusu affair
Oh Sofia nickname big caught everyone's
attention during the 1997 under-17 World
Cup in Egypt he was gonna stop scorer
and the third highest scorer in the
tournament with four goals sadly his
Korean never Mazda promised he showed
best player in the world and he got a
contract in Malaga he signed Malaga FC
in Spain he qualified the team to the -
De La Liga Premier League and then I
think they are way around at an injury
he had an injury and then you know when
injury setting your performance drop to
the lower level and that's what really
actually up into he stopped playing in
the early days we were still playing
playing Black Stars and everything he
was nowhere to be found
because he started to do a different
thing now it's in Germany working as I
showed you in 2001 if we return to Ghana
to spend two seasons with the kraaho so
food before spending a further two
seasons in Austria with felt catching
shot spots in Spain and England which
preceded the final returned to hassle
food where he finished his career in
2007 Daniel Aparri so much was expected
from him after showing much promise
after 2007 FIFA under-17 World Cup he
was recognized by the world soccer
magazine as one of the 50 most exciting
teenagers on the planet due to his
incredible foot speed and position
crossing he and a move to Real Madrid
Castilla
after the tournament apparel field to
break into Madrid first team and has
multi various teams in Europe instead
for playing time
Domenic idea that's my glimpse of his
talent he has never really built on the
promise he showed in the leds of hearts
offlaners and the national under-20 team
idea was our water the golden shoe for
the top scorer with eight goals in seven
games was not ready for that what
happened in Egypt I told myself yeah
this the biggest time for me now I need
to go further to achieve what I'm
looking for he's a good finisher if you
give him a chance he will score you and
it's very sharp is always hungry it's a
good player and strong and she strike
just after impressing in the under-20
World Cup and he joined a similar but
relatively a single game for the Syria
are giants probably probably that move
to AC Milan is what caused the whole you
know problem obviously for business
reasons on the side of AC Milan don't
want us to purchase the player improve
his lot I'm valued to him and make him a
big commercial product now the
expectation from the kind of performance
that he had put up was that he was going
to get an opportunity to play in AC
Milan Papa you know and of course this
is at a time when you know AC Milan was
doing very well but had big names you
know and that was where you know the
bone of contention was it becomes very
difficult when a player makes a move
into a club that already has a big name
and established players I believe some
choices we make you know during our
playing career help you or break you
that move was a big no-no he not done
that me but you know go to the gun in on
this is him an ante when it was good was
you know the onions loved it and it was
good for him entry wise everything so
you won't use judge the whole situation
clearly a talented player that has
consistently fluttered to deceive at a
similar and foods look like the finished

competition and you're looking at the
players like Dominique idea or Perry and
the posh marvelous a clinical finishes
and of course very top defenders indeed
if you look at a fight for instance
exist but actually earn him that call-up
to Real Madrid but the questioning is
where these players right for those big
stage some would say yes they needed it
to boost your confidence
others to tell you that you needed to
wait and bit your time one of the key
problems that have happening to Africa
and of course to the name players and
it's not peculiar to really Ghana
Nigeria as well is that these players
that you see playing down a seventeen
level are players who normally don't
play with their right ages and so they
get opportunity to move to these top
clubs and they come fit into the rhythm
and the play of the team because there's
another key component of you know sports
medicine where players who are of
seventeen eighteen or even teenagers you
are given a certain dosage of you know
medicine based on your injury and your
age and because Pacific EULA situation
of our players it goes a long way to
affect them so the problem Africa to a
large extent of heart is that we play in
these competitions with other ages
because you're supposed to be on the
same age bracket with a top player so it
means that in Africa we are not able to
nurture that talent with the same age to
meet up with the demands of football
other ages that is why you have a player
like Ryan Giggs or Adrian - ah who
played to the ages of 40 years and
retire we can also say that there's a
particular situation with Roger Milla
was a pleasure to work up over a over 40
years but that's just one of situation
because he had to come in as what one of
the key legends to the side whenever
played at the World Cup and so there was
a need for him to play that now I want
to give you a trickle example I've had a
treat after not to see a tweet of you
know static Adams where he took a
picture with himself and David here and
in that tweet he supposed to tell
ghanians Alyssa never had to play
football with the likes of DVD under and
the rest at a time when he was
struggling in Ghana playing for ash
gourd or contra call deputy here is
playing for Manchester United and so the
big question is what happened to you
[Music]

Hey everybody Rob here
Today we're gonna talk about all the things
That you need to do to make an amazing video
In particular we're gonna talk about pre-production
Which is all the things that you need to do before you grab that camera
Then, production, which is everything; once you grab that camera and you start shooting
and then post-production
Which is the process of taking that footage, ingesting it, and making the final product.
This is kind of giving you a feel for what we're going to be talking in this course
and then we're going to go into detail in future videos here
with each of the individual steps
and explain them a bit further
Alright, lets get started with pre-production
Alright, now the very first step in this whole process
is coming up with your story
What is the idea that you want to make a film about?
Often times, I will actually take a notebook, like this, this is good way to keep track of your story ideas.
I'll write them down here whenever they come to mind, and then I can refer back to them later.
Then next step is thinking about your audience.
This is really important because whoever your audience is, and how they're going to see it
They are gonna determine how you structure the rest of your film
Now for instance, we actually made all of the videos for this Biology textbook.
In a DVD in the back of the book.
So, in theory our audience was students.
So at the same time our audience was the teachers.
Cause the teachers had to watch the video first, think it was relevant to show to students in a classroom setting.
Really we are trying to make these videos, so you can show them to your class, mix up the lessons and make them more effective.
If we were making videos for people flipping through instagram, or through facebook
and we have a picture in our head of who's going to be watching them
we would make very different videos
We'd have it a lot spicier at the very beginning, but we had a captivated audience in those classrooms
So, did you see how it could structure the rest of the film?
obviously very important
Now, I wanna bring up clients and contracts
now obviously you can work with clients and do contracts at any stage in this process
But for me, definitely at this stage we are ready to sign a contract
and move forward with the rest of the scripting process
Alright, at this stage it's very important to think about
all of my books on how to make good films. Are you can use a narrator, or are you going to use a host?
Is it going to be first person or third person?
Is it going to be avant guarde or maybe an indie film?
There's so many ways that you can tell your story
But now is the stage you're going to have to figure out how you're gonna do it.
Alright, next thing you gotta do, is you gotta do your research.
You gotta figure out "What do people know about this topic?"
and maybe more importantly, has anyone done a video on it?
And if so, how are you going to make yours different
Now you're ready for the scripting process
Essentially you're going to start with a very detailed outline step by step
and if you're shooting a documentary
You may actually end with that outline
but if you want to take it one step further
then you're going to write a detailed script
Now, you're ready to wrap up pre-production
and you're gonna need to think about everything you need before you shoot
That might include, for instance, thinking about your location. You might even wanna go scout your location
then you're gonna have to think about all the logistics needed to get to that location and make it happen
and finally you're gonna have to make sure you have a good crew in place.
Alright, at this stage you're ready to shoot
this is the production process
for instance Jonah shoots all of our things
I shoot with Leo all the time
he's gonna be the talent here
Hailey often does a lot of the production
this is how it looks
But there are so many steps involved in making a good shot
I'm gonna kinda glaze over it at this stage
and we're gonna jump straight to post-production
Alright, now you got your media
you got everything shot and you're gonna start the post-production process
now sometimes you'll back up things in the field
lets say you didn't. You're going to plug your media into your computer
and you're gonna start media managing
this is a really important step.
essentially for us we're gonna use external drives here
we're gonna back it up there
we're gonna maybe make another copy
send it to another location
but from there that's where our rough cut starts
Oftentimes we'll have an assistant editor
or somebody to piece all the footage together so the editor can go through and start making cuts a bit easier
but this is where the real art happens
and I mean it is a very difficult process
one of the things you might do after the rough cut gets started
is do narration, for instance, I do that over here
It's actually kind of our closet
but its also a very nice sound proof room
I have these nice foam pads. I'll record my narration into here and then take it back to my rough cut
then I drop the narration in, start adding music and effects , I do color correction
I start fine tuning
I'll start working with the client. I will send them a copy
and say "Hey what do you think about this version?"
and they'll give me comments
and we just go back and forth in this somewhat of a dance
until we wrap things up
but that's more or less the whole process
Background voice: You just said that word for word holy crap.
this is kind of the first of the series
we have more detailed videos on all of these coming up
so if you're keen on this process
stay tuned I think you're really going to like it
uhh, that means you should subscribe
first of all, like this video if you got something out of it.
and big thanks to our patrons, who are allowing to take the time to give this to you guys
and we will get the next one out to you on Tuesday
Working with a film crew is great Rob and Jonas are awesome
they bring so many toys out on the boat with us
and uh lots of batteries too, nothing ever dies
and they never make us repeat answers to questions or anything
they always just ask you the question one time and that's it
its done, so uh
it's fantastic.

This is a 20-minute VHS tape about a LEGO
character called Jack Stone.
When it came out in 2001, it was the first
real computer-animated Lego movie.
… but it hasn’t aged that well.
"Incredible!"
"Fantastic."
Thirteen years later, The Lego Movie looked
like this:
Let’s watch that again.
This is 2001.
"There you have it."
And this is 2014.
"Yes, that's me."
That is a huge difference.
Here’s how they made it happen.
“My name is Grant Freckelton, I’m a production
designer at Animal Logic.”
He’s overseen the animation style of movies
like Legend of the Guardians, 300, and more
recently, The Lego Movie, with co-directors
Chris Miller and Phil Lord.
“Chris and Phil were determined to sort
of make sure the audience was confused about
what they were seeing.
You know is it actually stop motion, or is
it CG film?”
And that became a big debate.
Before the movie came out, there was a lot
of conversation about whether the movie was
stop motion or computer animation.
"It is, I would say 99% CG animation, but
it respects the rules of stop motion animation,
and is designed to emulate that style.”
To understand what made that style so unique,
you have to look back at what Lego movies
used to look like.
Early productions for themes like Bionicle,
Star Wars, and Batman helped establish the
whimsical feel of Lego movies — but the
animation didn’t fit the physics of the
toy itself.
“There was this tendency to sort of treat
the plastic like it was flexible rubber, which
meant that the characters could flex and move
a lot more than they might be able to in real
life.”
That style is typical of more traditional
computer animation, like what you’d expect
to see in a Pixar movie.
Take a shot like this, for example.
The background isn’t made of actual blocks,
plastic limbs are bending in ways they couldn’t,
and the faces are a bizarre blend of skin-like
texture and Lego geometry.
It doesn’t look like a scene you could make
at home with your own Legos.
Compare that to scenes from The Lego Movie,
where everything — gunshots, smoke, water,
fire, explosions, clouds, even mud on the camera
lens — are all made up of Lego pieces as
they look in real life.
“We respected the hardness of the plastic
by not necessarily bending on the elbow, which
you can’t do on a real Lego minifig.”
That means that any movement you see onscreen
simulates the adjustment or replacement of
an individual Lego piece.
A joint or facial expression will never actually
bend or stretch — it’ll either move slightly
or be replaced by another piece.
Early Lego movies lacked that level of discipline.
They struggled because they fought back against the limitations of the medium instead of embracing them.
But the creators of the Lego Movie saw things
differently.
“Characters that have limitations force you
to find solutions and charming ways of doing things
in different ways.
I mean, look at R2-D2: he’s like, the ultimate
limited character, he’s basically a bin
with wheels that makes beeping noises, and
that’s all he's got to work with.
And yet he’s a really charming character and everybody loves him. Same with BB-8.
And other characters. Same with the Muppets, they’re essentially sock puppets with googly eyes
that you don't really have much control over.
But it’s from those limitations that you actually get a lot of charm.”
Every now and then, the Lego movie animators
would let some joints overextend slightly
to make room for a nod or a shrug of the shoulders...
But overall, sticking to the plastic rule
made for a believable movie.
You can freeze frame any part of the Lego
Movie and look at a scene that you could practically
make at home.
“We were always trying to echo and hark
back to how a child might make a film.
So we would alternate between thinking like
responsible filmmakers working on a large-budget
Warner Brothers animated film, and then we
would suddenly approach a scene as if we were
like a kid animating in their basement.”
But the history of Lego movies actually does start
with kids animating in their basements.
In 1973, two Danish cousins, aged 10 and 12,
shot a short film called Journey to the Moon
on Super 8 film.
They made it for their grandparents’ 50th
wedding anniversary — and it’s widely
considered to be the first time anyone made
a motion picture with Lego blocks.
Note that the “people” in this film are
just little cylinder blocks — this was before
any version of the minifigure design came
out.
Movies like this came to be known as “Brickfilms.”
When fans were making these at home, they
shot them in traditional stop motion.
Footage was usually shot “on twos,” which
meant that they would take 12 pictures — adjusting
the characters every other frame — to make
one second of film.
Shooting “on ones” meant taking 24 pictures
per second — this was usually reserved for
making faster movements like running look
smoother.
When the Danish cousins sent their movie to
the managing director of the Lego Group, they
were rewarded with a tour of the Lego factory
and sent home with large Lego sets.
But Lego hasn’t always had the most positive
reaction to homemade fan films like this one.
Between 1985 and 1989, a teenage animator
named Lindsay Fleay worked on a 16-minute
short called The Magic Portal.
He used borrowed equipment to shoot it in
his parents’ basement.
Before entering festivals and competitions,
Fleay sent the film to Lego to see if they
were interested in doing something with it.
At first, Lego responded with a letter of
approval.
But soon, the company started expressing legal
concerns and issued a letter demanding Fleay
surrender all copies of the film within seven
days.
Lego ultimately backed down, but Fleay had
already missed out on most major film festivals
by then.
Fleay actually went on to work at Animal Logic.
He left before production on Lego projects
began, but his movie had a huge influence
on the world of Brickfilms.
“If you look at the live action portion
of The Lego Movie, you'll see
Finn, the little kid, holds up a sort of cardboard  tube and across the side is written Magic Portal."
The Lego Movie, of course, was a huge technical
feat.
There are 15,080,330 animated Lego pieces and 182 unique minifigures in the movie.
Early mockups of buildings and vehicles were drafted on a free software called Lego Digital Designer
Later on, in the animation software Maya,
each brick was given profiles for fingerprints,
dents, seam lines, scratches, and dust.
It’s hard to imagine what The Lego Movie
would be if it weren’t for the legacy of
these early home experiments.
Where most animated films use soft lighting
modeled after paintings, The Lego Movie’s
lighting was harsh, replicating the actual
lamps that animators like Fleay used.
Playful non-stop motion interludes — like
levitation via fishing line — were part
of Journey to the Moon long before they appeared
in The Lego Movie.
Even the final break from the Lego world into
the real world to meet a human creator parallels
The Magic Portal really closely.
Ah, my film!
It’s easy to miss on-screen, but The Lego
Movie pays tribute to fan films in the background
of this scene — these four clips are shorts
submitted by fans.
“Look at all these things that people built!”
The homage was a nod to the fans.
By doing that, the movie embraced the idea
that amateur creators matter — and sometimes,
the way they handle source material is far
better than the way major studios are used to doing it.
If you want to try any of this at home, you
can actually use the same software that the
animators of The Lego Movie used.
It’s called Lego Digital Designer, it’s
totally free off the internet.
When I talked to Grant Freckelton, he challenged
me to make this sort of pig-drawn carriage.
I tried.
I got the pigs, I got the wheels, but not
much else.
It’s very, very difficult.

it's morning it's another day as usual
every early The Men start hunting plants
for the day stuff
what I like in this community is the
communication they have
they follow the instructions of their
leader now we are going to hunting
[Music]
but before everything they make sure
their dog has eaten and is full
when the dog is full it makes them
easier in hunting
[Music]
they breed many dogs because the dogs
have been a great help in hunting
[Music]
the hunting work began and it did not
take time we succeeded in finding the
animal as usual hunters start by eating
meat as a sign of congratulations for
their work
foreign
they started by skinning the animal and
skinning it
While others prepare the fire so that we
can roast the meat

Ada: You are in orbit of Q-465b.
What about Philip?
Ada: Philip's cryopod has lost power.
His oxygen level is critical.
Plot a course to get me next to him.
Ada: This will significantly reduce your power reserves.
You may not have enough to return to Solis. Are you sure?
Emiliana: Positive, do it.
[pod engines fire up]
[low fuel warning beeps]
Decelerate.
Deploy the left lateral connectors.
 
Reverse engines. Get me to Solis.
 
 
Ada: Power reserves depleted.
Emiliana: Open doors to docking bay 2. Ada: Understood.
But you won't be able to correct your trajectory.
Deploy top connectors.
Magnetize.
[alarm cycles]
Ada, power up the medlab. Ada: Understood.
 
 
 
Ada, what's wrong with the med equipment?
Ada: The medical equipment is functioning properly.
Is Philip alive?
Ada: Yes.
Then why are the probes telling me he's dead?
Ada: I don't know.
Keep pumping O2 no matter what it says.
Ada: Understood.
 
Ada.
What the fuck happened?
Ada: I don't know.
Why did you eject our cryopods?
Ada: I did not eject any of the cryopods on the ship.
We landed with them. That means we should have been ejected.
Ada: I cannot explain this discrepancy.
[thud echoes aboard the ship]
[whispers] Ada...
Who else is on the ship?
Ada: You and Philip Mayda are the only people on the ship.
How many living beings are on the ship?
Ada: Two.
How many heat sources of approximately 37 degrees are on the ship?
Ada: Three.

Are you sure?
Ada: Yes.
Ada, identify the person I'm speaking with.
Ada: Philip Mayda
Identify the person on the med slab.
Ada: Philip Mayda.
Philip: Ada, how is that possible?
Ada: I cannot explain this discrepancy.
[sighs]
You died.
Philip: The hyperlight core gave out a few days ago.
We came out of cryo and... we been trying to fix it...
...since it happened.
You went space walking... I accessed the
core's external sensors. We were operating under no sleep but...
[external boom]
...just two hours ago
boom there was this explosion that surrounded the whole ship and y-
She died in the rain of wreckage.
Now you're here.
Alive. And-
You look... just like her.
Emeliana: Ada.
What's the current date and time?
Ada: Earth date is March 22, 2103.
The SUT is currently 954:34:54.
Philip: What?
Emiliana: T- Two hours ago was when were were schedule to exit hyperlight.
Philip: Heading where?
Did you activate your distress beacon?
Philip: Of course I did, it's protocol.
That's, that's why we came here - to respond to a distress beacon.
Philip: Christ!
Emiliana: When... When our Solis arrived yours was already here.
And we can't be in the same place at the same...
That's why you, the um...
The other you has no vitals because in this reality you're already here.
And I'm ok because I'm dead.
Emiliana: I'm so sorry.
Philip: Maybe uh...
...you and he...
...the other Phil worked but...
Sorry.
Listen, now that you're uh, back...
...here...
...we need to, uh, work on the hyperlink core again.
Emiliana: Ok.
Philip: Alright I'm gonna go hack away at the CPU.
I think the uh, next thing you were planning was uh...
you were gonna go check out the shore controller.
Ok.
Ada: Emiliana...
Are you feeling well?
[ship rumbling in space]
[connectors click]
[display beeps to life]
Philip on intercom: How's it goin?
It's not communicating with anything on the ship.
Yeah, I know.
I'm gonna try some mods.
Who knows if any of them work.
Ada, where are my quanter tools?
Ada: They're still in docking bay two.
Stay put.
I'll get 'em.
[intense music builds]
[door closes and locks]
[warning alarm begins]
Elimiana...
The shore controller's fried.
We're gonna be stuck here a long
long time.
No.
Don't do this.
Emiliana: You can't be in the same place at the same time.
Philip: Don't do this!
Whatever she did...
I'm sorry.
Ada: Emiliana I can't open the doors to docking bay to while Philip is inside.
Ada, manual override, priority five.
[override mechanism engaged]
He's gonna find out.
[docking bay doors close]
[docking bay locks and repressurizes]
[alarm cycles]
Philip: Hey.
I missed you.
What happened?
[grunts]
Tell me later.
I have a headache.
You ok?
I'm ok.
Totally fine.
 
 
Thanks for taking care of me.
Always.
 
 
 
 
 
 

belgium it's a country which often has
to justify its own existence sandwiched
between france germany and the
netherlands its population is divided
amongst those who speak well french
german and dutch since about six seconds
after its foundation other nations have
often spoke of dividing belgium up so
given how often its existence has both
been questioned and threatened there's
an obvious question to answer why does
belgium exist the first thing to answer
is how belgium came into existence in
the first place after the napoleonic
wars europe was a drastically changed
continent and one of the major changes
that occurred was that the austrian
netherlands was incorporated into the
brand new united kingdom of the
netherlands king william the first of
the netherlands was a protestant to add
little interest in preserving the rights
of the south's catholic residents he
used much of the south's industrialized
economy to fund the north and he was
also a bit of a despot this was
obviously a problem and in 1830 when
riots broke out talk soon turned to
secession william tried to crush the
revolt but many troops in the south
quickly defected william needed help and
so he asked the great powers for
assistance and the great powers did help
but they helped the south and recognize
the new country's independence and their
new country was called belgium
recognition of independence was done on
one condition it had to be a monarchy
because none of that republicanism stuff
absolutely not the belgians would
finally have a king that would represent
them a local a catholic and a man who
wouldn't try to expand the power of the
monarchy and become a despot instead
they got leopold the first a
german-speaking protestant who quickly
expanded the power of the monarchy but
you know zero out of three isn't bad
even with leopold belgium had come out
ahead given that at the london
conference france had proposed that
belgium be divided between its neighbors
this was the tally rand plan and was
rejected by the british because france
can't have nice things had been british
foreign policy for over 400 years at
this point and that wasn't going to
change any time soon also to britain
belgium was seen as an important buffer
state that would limit the scale of any
future franco-prussian war in theory
william the first didn't accept bulge in
independence and so invaded in 1831 but
the french came to the belgian's aid and
sent the dutch packing in 1839 william
accepted belgian independence and the
netherlands would never again try to
reclaim the south which now included
this land from luxembourg and it was
also in this year that britain
guaranteed belgian neutrality
immediately after belgium's formation
tensions arose between the
dutch-speaking population in the north
the flemish and the french-speaking
southerners the walloons whose language
was the official language of the state
the initial hope was to get northerners
over time to speak french but fun fact
no tensions between the two groups would
rise but the threat to dissolve belgium
never went anywhere since both peoples
largely saw unity within belgium as
better than the alternatives so what
about any future threats finding out why
belgium exists in the first place isn't
the same as asking why it still exists
and the fledgling nation wasn't without
its concerns french and german leaders
coveted parts of belgium in the late
19th and early 20th centuries but the
british guarantee in a fear of upsetting
the balance of power stopped any action
it wasn't until world war one that the
second tangible threat to belgium's
existence occurred when german troops
crossed into the country in order to get
to france germany occupied most of the
country and after the war the plan was
for these areas to be annexed into
germany and these areas would become a
rump state under a new monarchy towards
the end of the war germany made a
concession on these demands and would
respect belgian independence so long as
it was split into two nations the
northern flemish one being aligned with
germany who would gain antwerp this
never happened because obviously in
germany eventually lost the war belgium
then got to sit at the winner's table
and was even given this territory from
germany although at first belgium had
made much larger demands because it
wanted to annex luxembourg and to take
territory from the neutral dutch since
apparently belgium holds a grudge the
last threat to belgian existence came
during world war ii when it was
conquered it was originally administered
as a single unit along with a chunk of
northern france but hitler had very
little in the way of concrete plans the
belgian collaborators had hoped for
belgium to be split like this with
flanders being merged with the
netherlands yet germany was unwilling
and unable to do this since it was busy
losing the war in late 1944 germany then
formally annexed belgium a plan which
had one snag it had already been
liberated and so that's not how that
works no other nation would threaten
belgian existence thereafter and all
attempts to split the state would from
then on be internal in nature belgium's
existence is actually quite remarkable
given that it spent one of the most
dangerous periods in european history
sandwiched between two nations that
really liked annexing things in the end
the belgian people would find union
together despite their differences much
more compelling than any of the
alternatives and that is why belgium
exists i hope you enjoyed this episode

before you miss me too much.
- Initiate return sequence.
- [Ethan] Starting FTL spin-up sequence.
- [Sarah] Roger that, Longshot.
(spaceship humming)
- And we are a go across
the board, Flight.
- [Sarah] Spin her up, Commander.
(engine whining)
- Flight, it looks like I may
have an interlock issue here.
- We're seeing the same thing here.
Let's take a look at diagnostics.
Abort FTL drive start and spin down.
- Roger that.
Spinning down.
(computer beeping)
Flight, we have a problem.
(spaceship whooshing)
(alarm beeping)
(energy crackling)
(dramatic music)
Flight, I have lost drive control.
Repeat, I have lost drive control.
I have no nav comm and I
am approaching light speed.
- Find him, Comms!
- [Ethan] I am being
pulled in to a new vector!
- [Computer] Warning, hull breach.
Warning, hull breach.
Warning, hull breach.
Warning.

(spaceship rumbling)
Warning, hull breach.
Warning, hull breach.
- I need information people, come on!
Where's our bird?
- Gone, I mean gone.
No vector, nothing to track.
We should be able to get him
on Q comm anywhere, but nothing.
- Stand by, we're receiving
some new information.
Commander Kane seems to have disappeared.
- Where did Dad go?
- [Reporter] The Longshot
was ready to make
the return voyage home
but something seems to have gone wrong.
We will continue to follow the story
and provide updates on
any new developments.
(tense music)
- [Computer] Warning, hull breach.

- [Reporter] After almost a day
since his last communication,
the search for Commander Kane continues.
We have reached out for the
Commander's family for comment.
We're sure it's been a
difficult time for them.
Along with the rest of the world,
we hold out hope for a safe return.
- [Sarah] Nothing more to do today.
Go home.
(radio squelching)
- Uh, Flight?
There's something.
- [Ethan] Control, come in.
- You guys getting this?
- [NavCom] NORAD is reporting an anomaly
approximately 2.4 clicks from ISS.
- Anomaly?
Do we have a visual?
- Coming up.

Lo agarramos llendo a la Frontera
Did you get it?
No.
This is all he had on him.
Fellas.
Nathan Drake!
In the flesh.
Legendary treasure hunter,
Explorer!
Historian!
Thief.
Whoa, hey- I think you have me confused with somebody else, pal.
The man responsible for finding El Dorado,
Corvera,
And Shambala.
Oh. Then yes. Okay, then. Yeah, that's me.
Last night an antiquities collector held a private auction in La Paz.
A rare item of great value was stolen.
An item my employer rightfully purchased.
So imagine my surprise
When I find out that Nathan Drake is in town.
Sounds like quite a coincidence.
I'd say.
Tell me
What exactly is this?
That is a compass.
Perhaps we can...
use it to find this fella a 
haircut that didn't go out in the '90s.
Am I right guys?
You're a funny guy
-Where is it?
-Look? I don't know what it is you're looking for, but I don't have it
My employer is not a man you want to cross.
-You've already made 'em quite angry. 
-I do tend to have that effect on people.
Let's try this once more, shall we?
Before I violently remove 
something you care deeply about.
So does that mean..
if I care deeply about you, you'll leave?
Okay, okay, we'll see how cooperative you are after a little time with "El Tigre"
"El" who?
-You're getting all this?
-Oh yeah! Loud and clear, Kid!
Pulling up plans for the house now. Let's keep those guys busy a little longer
Easy for you to say, you're not about to get your finger removed from some fella named "El Tigre".
I'm not sure that's the body part they're thinkin' of removing.
Oh oh!
That's "El Tigre"?
Thank God! Guys, Oh
Whoo! Seriously, that's... You guys. You got me, you got me... That was..
Well presented... I was scared.
Have fun.
Hey there little guy, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Oh Crap.
Wait! Wait.
I don't want to micromanage this thing, 
but I think you're supposed to be asking questions in between the punch
I consider this a privilege, "Cabron"
I hear there're many men who would pay a great deal to spend some time alone with you.
Awkward.
Got it. Second floor, southeast corner.
Tigre!
Algo no esta bien
-Nate! You good?
-Ah Yeah... Never better
It doesn't look like they're on to you yet. So just get moving
-They seem pretty pissed about the bracelet.
-Yeah, I should've told 'em you have it. 
My face wouldn't be as sore.
-Keeping it nice and warm for me?
-Oh, yeah, nice and toasty
Hey, not to put a damper on things, but what happens if those letters aren't there?
Chloé said that the intel is solid.
Guy paid top dollar for it.
Yeah, they paid top dollar for security, too.
Okay, I'm in
Sully
-You really need to check out this room. 
-Yeah, maybe on the next tour. Hurry up will ya?
These guys gonna be on to you in a minute.
Here we go, I found Sir Albuquerque's letters.
Ooh... This guy's not messing around
He's got original copies dating back to the conquest of Malacca
Here we go.
October 1511, that's right before they sailed back to Portugal in the Florida Lamarr
Which is now sitting at the bottom of the Indian Ocean, I'm telling you Nate. It's Wild Goose
Yeah, wild goose worth 2 billion.
The most valuable lost treasure in human history.
Wait a minute..
He's got a whole stack of letters from Ferdinand Magellan to Albuquerque
Earliest one is dated such a few weeks after the floor sink. So..
So Magellan served under Albuquerque during the conquest, but history tells us that's the last they saw of each other.
Unless..
-Holy shit Sully. Do you know what this means? 
-Kid, whenever you start doing this, nobody knows what you mean.
Looks like it's gonna have to wait.
They found your friends. Get the hell out of there!
Just like old times.
Miss me?
You know, I always find myself amazed that you two are incapable of returning these things the way you found them
-We got the insurance. You did get the insurance right? 
-I thought you did?
Right.
As Promised.
-Wow!
-Right?
-So we're gonna break this open? I feel like we're always breaking things open.
-How about I hang onto that?
Hey! Did you see this?
-Well, I'll be go to hell 
-A triangle?
-Not just a triangle, it's a Trinity.
A Trinity, oh my god, of course.
When the flor Delamar sank, it took 400 people down with it, but not Albuquerque.
He was rescued by another ship called the trendajey
Portuguese for trinity. Exactly. Now, history is spotty on who captained it, but there was another ship called the Trinidad.
A spanish flagship famous for having been the first to sail around the world.
Magellan. Holy shit.
Magellan captained the rescue ship.
Oh..
-Would you look at that.
-Could those be coordinates?
It never made any sense, why would Albuquerque, considered to be one of the most brilliant military minds in history
Put his treasure on the flor Delamar, a ship that had proven itself time and time again to be unseaworthy.
What if the reason no one has found the treasure of the Flor delamar is because the treasure was never on it.
-It was on the trendaje. 
-Exactly it never sank, and Magellan and Albuquerque both knew it.
So, what's this then?
Our next stop.
Well, I understand the weather in the Philippines is particularly fine this time of year.

this is the true story of Hannah
Cornelius a kind adventurous and
selfless young woman someone that's had
a bright life ahead of her with so much
more to give her fellow humans animals
and the world but after giving her
friend a lift home one night four men
descended on her car what would become
of Hannah

remember choosing to be kind can save a
life in many ways thank you so much for
choosing to be here with me our love and
respect goes out to those that new and
loved Hannah and all those affected by
this case
Hannah Cornelius was born on February
the 12th 1996 in Cape Town South Africa
born to Willem a magistrate and Anna a
lawyer she grew up in a stable and happy
family she was kind intelligent and very
hard-working in the summer of 2015
Hannah started her bachelor's degree at
Stellenbosch University she loved her
studies and quickly adapted to
university life she lived at the Irene
ladies resident in Stellenbosch which
was nearby in her spare time she
volunteered at the tears Animal
Sanctuary in Cape Town she was also very
sociable and made friends easily whilst
University her willingness to help
others out and her happy personality
made it easy for her to connect with
other people in her second year at
University she met cheslin Marsh a
fellow student studying theology they
quickly became close friends but no one
could have anticipated what they would
go on to endure together on Friday the
26th of May 2017 Hannah and cheslin were
out for drinks with friends they were in
their second year of University and
after a long week of studying and
working hard they were blowing off some
steam as the evening Drew to a close
cheslyn offered to walk Hannah back to
her residence
Stellenbosch located just east of Cape
Town is a University Town surrounded by
hundreds of Vineyards many of which play
Parts in South Africa's famous wine
industry the oak shaded streets aligned
with Boutique cafes and galleries but
these shaded streets are also dangerous
streets for a girl walking alone Hannah
gratefully accepted his offer of company
and they made it back to her residence
without any trouble however Hannah as
caring as she was was concerned about
cheslin getting home safely despite his
insistence that he would be fine riding
his longboard home Hannah offered to
drive him back in in her car which was
parked just around the corner Hannah
drove an old blue and white Volkswagen
City Golf a car that her 90 year old
grandmother had gifted to her she loved
driving anyway and it would take her no
time at all to drop him off cheslin
eventually accepted her offer and the
two drove off towards his home at around
3 23 a.m on a Saturday morning Hannah
parked her car on a small patch of grass
while she and cheslin said their
goodbyes she wasn't parked up for long
not long enough to notice the four men
walking by their car along the road they
didn't notice the group the first time
they passed by the car they also didn't
notice them as they approached the car
for a second time using a nearby truck
for cover the four men pounced in just a
split second the passenger door was
ripped open a sharpened screwdriver and
a flip knife were pressed against both
their necks the situation became very
serious and very real very very fast and
the four men forced themselves into the
vehicle before they could do anything to
stop it Hannah and cheslyn were both
real-time victims of carjacking after a
search to find in claimed control of the
car keys one of the four men a 29 year
old Nashville Julius left unfortunately
this wasn't a sign of Mercy everyone
else stayed inside the car Hannah was
forced to sit in between the two front
seats she was flanked by two unknown
assailants cheslin was being pinned by
the third in the back just 17 minutes
after they had pulled up at 3 40 AM
Hannah's Volkswagen Golf drove away
neither cheslin nor Hana knew the nights
that they were in for sadly this was
just the beginning Hannah's vehicle then
wasn't seen for around an hour but at 4
34 am it was spotted by a surveillance
camera at a petrol station a station
located just outside of Stellenbosch
somewhere along the dusty road out of
town the men had stopped the vehicle and
forced cheslin into the boot of the car
they frisked him for everything that he
had including his jacket and shoes as
the car arrived at the petrol station a
figure in a cream-colored jacket can be
seen in the passenger seat and a
surveillance camera inside the station
captures Vernon with buoy entering the
shop with a wallet the wallet belonged
to cheslin with cheslin's bank card and
pin at the ready he was ready to rinse
it unfortunately after multiple attempts
to access his bank account it appeared
as thy cheslin and lied about the pin
number an action he would later pay for
dearly after re-entering the vehicle the
five of them continued their journey to
cry Fontaine this is a neighboring town
to Stellenbosch during this entire
horrific car ride with chess Lynn still
in the boot Hannah remained in the front
of her grandmother's car surrounded it
on all sides by three unknown and
dangerous men she was compliant and
Cooperative not looking around arguing
or fighting instead she stared Straight
Ahead into the dark Road Hannah did
everything right the men made several
trips around the local area stopping
infrequently to visit various people
these were most likely illicit substance
pickups and drop-offs during this time
cheslin was still in the boot trying to
kick the door open whenever he thought
the men weren't around but his attempts
were fruitless he was trapped and
helpless that was until 5 30 am when
suddenly the men stopped the car just
outside of kraaifontaine Hannah asked
the men what they were stopping for and
they told her they were just going for a
smoke break they told her they would be
on their way soon and would return her
car when they got to their final
destination it was at that moment that
two of the men got out of the car went
around the back and removed cheslin from
the trunk this wasn't a smoke break they
were clearly mad that he hadn't given
them the correct pin number this was
Revenge cheslin was pushed shoved and
screamed at and found himself lying on
the dusty ground three men standing over
him with bricks in their hands cheslin
knew this was the end as the morning sun
began to climb over the horizon horrors
of the night were still in full momentum
for Hannah and unfortunately it would
only get worse driving not far from
where the men left cheslin the group
then traveled to an unused paintball
course along bottle Ray Road here Hannah
was assaulted and violated by all three
men though this wasn't the end of her
ordeal sadly things would get a lot
worse next they drove the stolen car and
the terrified 20 when you're all to a
Vineyard as daylight flooded the farms
and Savannahs of South Africa a young
couple had awoken to a fresh spring
weekend living in their quaint home
along the outskirts of kraaifontaine the
sounds of birds traveled throughout the
air but alongside these familiar
peaceful sounds a distant groaning
slowly began to cut through that
groaning soon turned into desperate
screens peering outside of their window
the couple spotted a young man he was
Dazed confused and covered in a red
substance remarkably it was cheslin
despite taking several bricks to the
head and permanently losing the hearing
in one ear he was alive and his mind was
as clear as anything with his friend
nowhere to be found he knew he needed to
seek help he had stumbled down the road
to find the closest sign of humanity
that he could find and luckily he found
a couple willing to help within many is
cheslin was pleading with local police
to help find Hannah he described the
faces of the four men he described the
car all of the locations visited that
night anything else he could remember
from the night before he desperately
wanted to help find his friend Hannah
but tragically it was already too late
just two hours earlier whilst he was
still unconscious Hannah had already
been found she was already gone police
went out in a Relentless search to find
cheslin and Hannah's abductors they
didn't need to look very hard the men
had continued on their crime spree that
morning they had reportedly chased down
a woman on her way to work before
robbing her of her bag and her cell
phone at 1pm that very same day they
attacked yet another woman this time
kidnapping her surveillance cameras
captured the car at a nearby shell pet
station the CCTV shows the blue
Volkswagen pulling into the gas station
the same man that tried to use cheslin's
bank cards exited the car he made his
way to an ATM and attempted to withdraw
money from the woman's account this time
he was successfully able to withdraw 3
000 Rand they rewarded the victim's
cooperation by abandoning her on a rural
road they then dropped off one of the
assailants at his home with only two
continuing to drive around into the late
evening these two men were Vernon witbui
and Geraldo Parsons little did they know
that the police had already been alerted
to their movements throughout that day
and now they were closing in just one
hour later an undercover police vehicle
spotted the missing car driving by and
as the pursuit began a second police van
joined in on the chase desperately
trying to evade law enforcement the men
inside the blue Volkswagen Golf pull
into the driveway of a nearby private
Farm the two men made a run for it
warned sprinting and jumping into the
river below but this was ultimately in
vain they got themselves trapped and
could not escape from the officers many
of them were now hot on their tail armed
and ready to fire their sick and twisted
game was now finally over following the
arrests both whitbury and Geraldo were
more than happy to name the other two
men behind the terrible crimes this led
to two more arrests the very next day
Nashville Julius Geraldo Parsons Eben
van niekerk Vernon whippery these were
the four men responsible for 11 hours of
Terror endured by cheslin and Hannah in
May of 2018 the court proceedings would
finally begin against the men who took
the life of hammer and attempted to take
the life of cheslin the evidence against
them was solid they had testimonies
confessions from both Vernon and Geraldo
surveillance footage forensic evidence
and most importantly cheslin who took
the stand during court he explained they
were taking me into the bushes and then
they told me I should lay my head on a
piece of brick that's when I realized
these people are going to take my life
away and as I was laying on the brick I
closed my eyes and prayed and asked the
Lord for forgiveness for whatever I did
in this life they didn't expect cheslin
to survive they left him there for dead
Geraldo Parsons took to the stand and
explained that they didn't intend to
then kill Hannah he alleges that the
terrified 21 year old offered to have
intimate relations with the men if in
return they wouldn't take her life they
then took it in turns to violate her
they then put her in the boots of her
own car and drove her to a nearby
Vineyard Parsons told the court she
didn't want to climb out of the boot she
was holding on to the car she started
panicking Eben came up and jabbed her I
let her go as the blood started to spill
then I saw Vernon arrive with a rock I
told Vernon don't kill her we've already
killed cheslin let's leave her but
Vernon threw the rock on Hannah's head
this rock was 42 kilograms around 92
pounds the impact would have been so
great that the injuries would have been
immediate and final although this case
was clearly stacked against these four
men only two of them would confess in
fact all four of them pled not guilty to
their crimes throughout these Court
appearances it appeared as if these men
had very little remorse for their
actions they even smiled and laughed
throughout the trial But ultimately
Vernon whippery Geraldo Parsons IBN van
niekerk and Nashville Julius was
sentenced to life in prison and Julius
was sentenced to 22 years for aiding and
abetting do you think the punishment
fits the crime here what do you think
could be done to avoid something like
this happening again in the future let

fukushima power plant disaster the power
of atoms released by earthquake
on march 11 2011 the japanese islands
were struck by an earthquake of enormous
force for six minutes the ground was
shaking turning whole towns into piles
of rubble but while the struggle to
recover from the most powerful
earthquake in the history of japan was
going on no one was aware that the
earthquake was the prelude to yet
another drama at the fukushima daiichi
nuclear power plant a disaster of
unprecedented proportions was about to
happen welcome to dark history where we
unravel the most disastrous events in
history
if you want to support the channel
consider subscribing and like this video
the magnitude 9.1 undersea mega thrust
earthquake was not the only disaster
that struck the northeastern coast of
honshu island that day around half an
hour after the earthquake a tsunami hit
the coast it was actually this giant
wave that brought more devastation than
the earthquake more than 200 square
miles of ground were flooded taking away
thousands of lives and causing damage
worth hundreds of billions of dollars at
the town of okuma and the fukushima
prefecture the tsunami flooded the
nuclear power plant cutting off the
power supply to a system responsible for
cooling down the nuclear reactors with
no means to reduce it the temperature of
the reactors increased and eventually
caused explosions in four reactors
the amount of radiation released into
the atmosphere made the fukushima power
plant disaster the second most infamous
nuclear incident in the history of the
world
the 2011 tohoku earthquake was the most
powerful earthquake ever recorded in
japan the epicenter of the magnitude 9.1
thrust was in the northwestern pacific
ocean
45 miles east of oshika peninsula on
honshu island the largest of four
japanese main islands the earthquake was
felt throughout the entire country but
the most powerful vibrations were
recorded in the prefectures of miyagi
fukushima ibaraki
and toshigi
thrust was so powerful that it moved the
island of honshu eight feet east and
shifted the earth on its axis by ten
inches
increasing its rotational speed by 1.8
milliseconds per day
even though the japanese had never
witnessed an earthquake of such an
enormous force
they knew how to behave in such
situations
after all japan is the country with the
most earthquakes in the world one thing
the japanese knew for sure
when a strong earthquake strikes it is
always accompanied by a tsunami tsunamis
are waves produced by undersea
earthquakes
once the waves approach the coast in the
shallow waters they turn into giant
waves
the march 11th earthquake was expected
to produce a tsunami as high as 130 feet
in certain regions the first and the
most powerful earthquake that day
occurred at
46
it lasted for six whole minutes causing
severe damage to infrastructure in the
most affected regions
as soon as the ground stopped trembling
a tsunami warning was issued only a
couple of minutes was given to citizens
in the coastal areas to leave their
homes and run to higher grounds
indeed about half an hour later a mighty
tsunami hit the northeastern coast of
honshu island
not even 18 ft high sea walls were
enough to stop the giant wave
whole towns were engulfed by the sea
water taking everything in its way
compared to the damage inflicted by the
tsunami the earthquake was just a minor
disturbance in the four prefectures most
affected by the earthquake and tsunami
there were four nuclear power plants
with 11 reactors operating at the moment
one of them was tepco's six reactors
fukushima daichi nuclear power plant and
the coastal town of okuma
only reactors 1 2 and 3 were operational
when the earthquake occurred as soon as
the ground started trembling they
automatically shut down and stopped
producing energy the design of reactors
and the entire power plant was robust
enough to withstand earthquakes even of
such tremendous scale however
the damage was inflicted to all six
external power supply sources providing
electricity to pumps needed for cooling
down the reactor's cores
even though the reactors stopped working
the cores continued to heat up due to
the decay heat produced by the
radioactive nuclear fuel after the
fission has ceased
as a result each reactor was equipped
with a pump that circulated water
through reactor cores to cool it down
when these pumps were cut off from the
external power supply sources emergency
diesel generators automatically took
over the cooling of the reactors
everything appeared to be in perfect
order
but then the tsunami came
at 1542
the first 45 feet high wave hit the
daiichi power plant located on the very
coast it was followed by another one
eight minutes later the power plant's 30
foot high sea walls proved inadequate
protection in this situation and the
water broke into the power plant the
diesel generators located in the
basement of the turbine buildings were
flooded and stopped working the whole
power plant went into a blackout more
importantly the reactor cooling system
stopped working the situation caused
serious concern in the plant where an
immediate evacuation of the staff was
ordered
the plant management informed the
fukushima prefecture authorities about
the problem and at around 1903 a nuclear
emergency was declared at 2050 an
evacuation order was issued for all
people within a radius of two kilometers
from the plant half an hour later as the
news of the situation and the plant
reached the government in tokyo
the radius was extended to three
kilometers
with standard pumps unpowered and diesel
generators flooded the planned staff
that remained on the site began
injecting water into the system via an
emergency core cooling system but
unfortunately their effort to connect
the plant to the external power system
was fruitless with the cooling system
out of order the temperature of the fuel
rods inside the reactor pressure vessel
began to rise
producing a lot of steam pressure the
pressure was reduced by venting it to
the suppression pond wet well specially
designed for this purpose
this led however to the decrease of
water level inside the vessel with fuel
rods
three hours after the earthquake the
water level in reactor one dropped below
the top of the fuel rods
one and a half hours later
the water level was already at the
bottom of the fuel rods as the
temperature of fuel rods increased to 2
800 degrees celsius they began to melt
with fuel rods exposed their hot
zirconium cladding came in contact with
the steam producing an enormous amount
of hydrogen the presence of hydrogen
itself was not the problem
however its mixture with oxygen either
pure or in the air is highly explosive
as the plant staff attempted to relieve
the pressure inside the reactor pressure
vessel
the hydrogen was accidentally released
into the service floor at the top of the
reactor building on march 12th at 1536
the mixture of hydrogen and air ignited
and caused a massive hydrogen explosion
that blew off the roof of the reactor
building a similar scenario was going on
in reactors 2 and 3 with a certain delay
however the backup water injection
system in these units was powered by
batteries and was in operation longer
the system collapsed in reactor 3 on
march 12th while in reactor 2 it went
down on march 14th
at 1100 hours on march 14th a hydrogen
explosion blew off the roof and the top
part of the building of reactor number
three
due to the joint piping system some of
the hydrogen leaked to reactor 4
causing the same type of explosion early
in the morning of march 15th
inside reactor 2 there was no explosion
on the service floor to prevent
explosions like those in reactors 1 and
3
the staff opened the blowout panel on
top of the building to vent out the
hydrogen even though they prevented an
explosion
their maneuver led to increased emission
of radioactive gases outside the reactor
building the process of venting out the
pressure was not the only source of
radioactive pollution
it is estimated that most radioactivity
was emitted from reactor 2 where the
meltdown of the nuclear fuel and an
explosion in the primary containment
drywell caused a rupture in the reactor
walls allowing the polluted water to
leak out among fission products released
into the air and sea were iodine 131
ccm-137 and ccm-134
iodine 131 is a volatile radioisotope
with a very short half-life of only
eight days
ccm-137 however has a half-life of more
than 30 years and exposure to large
amounts of it can cause severe sickness
and even death
aware of the dangers caused by the
meltdown of nuclear fuel already on
march 12th the authorities ordered the
evacuation of everyone within a 12-mile
radius from the plant
radioactive releases spread quickly
already on march 12 the day when the
first explosion occurred
increased radiation was detected at a
station 120 miles away two weeks later
radio activity was detected and
measuring stations across the northern
hemisphere the lucky circumstance was
that the amount of radioactivity turned
out to be below the level that could
seriously threaten people's lives and
health the emission of radioactivity was
10 times smaller than at chernobyl the
worst nuclear disaster in the history of
the world
a more controversial issue was the
release of contaminated water into the
ocean
to obtain more storage for highly
contaminated water and with the
government's permission plant staff
released 10 400 cubic meters of
contaminated water to the sea in early
april in addition an unknown amount of
the contaminated water from reactor 2
had leaked through the ground
unlike chernobyl the fukushima nuclear
incident resulted in no direct
casualties however
154 000 people were evacuated from the
area around the plant
it was a huge shock to leave homes and
everything they had to most of them it
is estimated that most of more than two
thousand disaster related deaths were
caused not by radioactivity exposure but
by stress caused by the evacuation and
living in shelters
still
life changed for good for those who
lived within the 143 square miles red
zone even in 2021 this zone remains
evacuated
the march 2011 events were a disaster of
enormous proportions
the forces of nature were relentless and
unstoppable what happened at the
fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant
seemed like an unfortunate outcome of a
natural disaster that could not be
prevented however the truth was quite
different
the independent investigation commission
set up by the national parliament
determined that the plant power tokyo
electric power company tepco
had failed to meet the safety
requirements in case of natural
disasters
and completely ignored the tsunami risk
assessments based on the latest
researches tepco management failed to
improve a number of features that would
have prevented the disaster
starting from low sea barriers over
inadequate cooling systems to unclear
instructions given to employees in case
of an incident the company management
was accused of negligence to maintain
the myth of absolute safety of nuclear
power
if the risks were publicly acknowledged
the management feared the public would
demand the plans to shut down therefore
any kind of preparation in case of
nuclear incidents was not allowed in
order not to disturb the public
a part of the blame was also on the
government which failed to force the
nuclear power plants to implement
adequate safety measures
paradoxically the nuclear safety
regulatory regime that was supposed to
do the job was under the jurisdiction of
the ministry of economy trade and
industry one of the fiercest promoters
of nuclear energy twelve days after the
earthquake reactors at the fukushima
nuclear power plant were connected to
external power sources and the cooling
of reactors one to three was
re-established
on august 10th
work began on building covers over the
reactors to prevent further emission of
radioactive particles at the same time
cleanup crews have already removed much
of the radioactive debris from the site
nine months after the incident three
damaged reactors were put into a stable
state of cold shutdown
the fukushima power plant disaster
brought significant changes in japan's
energy policy
public confidence in the safety of
nuclear power was greatly damaged
despite the government's intention to
increase the participation of nuclear
power plants and overall power
production
they were forced to reduce the nation's
reliance on nuclear power
immediately after the fukushima disaster
all but two nuclear reactors in the
country were temporarily shut down
the government ordered nuclear risk and
safety reassessments and formed a new
nuclear regulatory agency
within the environment ministry to
control the work of nuclear power plants
the fukushima nuclear disaster taught
the japanese and the whole world that
the horrifying strength of nuclear power
should never be taken for granted

I'm listening to you
and i have all these things happening inside of me
and I keep thinking
"You don't have what I have."
These feelings are like a fucking volcano right now for me.
I enjoy inflicting pain on people.
I am a sadistic narcissist.
So very often I will externalize my internal aggression
in order to...
kind of... enjoy the effects on people.
People are good, and they don't deserve to be hurt.
They don't deserve to be treated that way.
And that you see vulnerability and you pounce on it like a fucking lion on a gazelle
Is wrong!
 
The person with NPD, the root of their NPD is a highly traumatic, highly painful environment.
Usually childhood.
And it usually forms between two polarities where the child is being overtly abused
and neglected and then also being spoiled in some way.
That is also boundariless.
So you might have an abusive father and then an apologetic, guilt-ridden mother.
The father abuses and the mother overcompensates for the child.
Is that child then gonna spend the rest of their life experiencing huge amounts of anxiety
and depression?
Yes.
I have the most extreme form of narcissism.
Narcissistic personality disorder.
Where there is a total disruption, there's total emotional dysregulation;
emotions are inaccessible.
Perhaps because they are threatening, but they are inaccessible.
So I don't emote.
I have no emotions whatsoever, except a few negative emotions.
Such as anger or envy, or to some extent, hatred.
 
When I started realizing all this mess was about two years ago when I started having
problems with my husband, and I just didn't quite understand why.
I've been trying to do everything I've been taught.
Why is it not working?
We went to a therapist in the hopes of making our relationship better. I had to push for that.
She mentioned to me:
"Your husband is a narcissist, and you are a codependent."
And I was like...What?
What is that?
Well, you know narcissist is all upon themselves. Well like yeah...
And codependents...
I never heard codependency before, that word.
And So I went online I put into a search engine, "codependency" because she mentioned that I was a codependent
and then I found out about codependency and later I start finding out about narcissism.
I'm a narcissist so my main motivation is what is called "narcissistic supply".
Essentially, attention.
Narcissistic supply is a fancy name for attention.
I'm also getting money, but that's a secondary consideration.
Narcissistic supply (attention) is what I use to regulate my sense of self-worth.
My sense of self-worth, as opposed to normal people or healthy people.
fluctuates constantly, it's labile, it goes up and down.
And when it's down, it's very down.
So I need to regulate it, I need to stabilize it by having people telling me that I am
as fantastic, as grandiose, as omniscient, as omnipotent, as brilliant, and as perfect
as I imagine myself to be.
(seminar attendee): Do you think that people have to compliment you because you do feel that you are superior actually?
I believe that you believe it.
I believe that you believe it.
*quietly*: What does it mean?
However, it is completely irrelevant to me what you believe.
They are addicted to attention, adulation, adoration.
You have to look up them.
And you do, because they are really wonderful in the beginning.
You are just blown away.
"This is the best man I've ever known."
And then they become your worst nightmare.
What you are doing is you are giving them what they need.
They give you what you want, which is this like "Cinderella-dream" thing.
And then, what's happening is that they can make you addicted to this love bombing thing.
And then, the mask falls, because they feel "Oh, I got her, I can chill now.
I can relax.
I can let me be myself".
They call it the mask.
Now, the mask starts to fall, and you start to see these cracks.
And they start to slip up.
"Oh, I don't want to go with your family to dinner.
Who wants to meet your family?"
"Your friend is an asshole."
And they start to criticize things in your life that are important to you because they
feel threatened by it because they have to overpower you and control everything that's
important to you.
They take it as a criticism if you counter anything they say.
It's a bad idea doing anything to a narcissist that threatens their hyper-idealised self-image
because they will punish you very severely.
You can be punished by a narcissist simply for existing without needing them.
They can find that threatening.
You can be punished by a narcissist simply for saying politely
"No, I don't wish to do that."
It's an extremely cruel internal world in which they live.
Which is why that cruelty is mirrored outwards to their victims.
My then-boyfriend had tried to kill me more than once.
I didn't understand.
I didn't understand this was all a game.
And I didn't understand it was a really dangerous game.
"By force or by guile, you will play this game with me or I will destroy you and kick
you out my little world."
I had a car, and he jumped into my car, and he came in.
I don't know why I Iet him get into the driver side.
And we started to drive towards the Brooklyn Bridge, and he told me he was gonna run us
off the bridge and kill us.
That was the first time I had ever bagged for my life.
It's a haunted house.
The narcissist personality is a haunted house, so you need ghostbusters, not therapists.
In order for me to live a life where I'm abusing people without ever being wrong.
How is that?
You have to have a truly insane psychotic level of a break with reality and you are
constantly ducking and diving... they are like ninjas, like psychological ninjas trying to dodge
the laser beams of responsibility.
Where somebody would say...
"Hey, that doesn't even make sense.
How could you be...?"
If the person (the target) was a perfect idealised version on Monday, how could they be devalued on Friday?
"That means you are wrong."
"Well, I'm never wrong."
For me, I'm a sucker for love.
LIke a love addict.
It becomes a toxic love because once they are done love bombing you, they're secure in
you and know that they have you, that's when it turns around.
They begin to abuse you, take advantage, hurt you, verbally assault you, rage on you, cheat
on you, do all kinds of things to destroy you.
And by then, you've become addicted to this "golden period" and hoping to get it back.
"What have I done?
How can I get that love back?"
That's not real love.
Real love doesn't just treat you like crap after they've treated you well.
It passes time and with a narcissist, it's not like that.
The NPD goes through a sense of shame and failure that they didn't manage to maintain
that source of supply; because they were left.
They will go through rage (narcissistic rage) because that person had the temerity to leave them.
Somewhere in there, I'm pretty sure
there will be just plain old, boring, standard, common-or-garden,
to the narcissist this is all incredibly insulting,
sadness.
The sadness of a mere mortal who simply misses their mate.
That that leaks through, will be countered in the narcissist's self by huge amounts of
rage and huge amounts of self-loathing.
"How dare they make me feel sadness?"
"How dare they make me feel a human emotion?"
So their rage to their victim will become even stronger.
Their shame and their determination to never let this happen again will become stronger.
They will actually become more abusive through the experience.
Whereas a neurotypical person, when we grieve, when we feel sadness, you can become more humble.
You can become more open. You can become more compassionate to other people.
Not so for the NPD.
I would map the person, and then if I'm so inclined, inclined to inflict pain,
then I would push highly specific buttons.
Penetrate through highly specific chinks, through highly specific routes
to reach the core and inflict, usually pretty substantial, damage.
I felt that she has tried a lot of techniques to sort of push my buttons, to make me panic.
She was trying to create a situation where she can make me react and confuse me and maybe
draw me back in.
Or something.
And I think she has tried a lot of things.
She used finances, she used where we staying.
All these things.
And now the children are coming into the situation, I can feel it.
I think she can do something with the children.
And I don’t know how far she can go.
But I wouldn’t be surprised if she did something totally crazy.
Had I grown up in a functional, functioning family with functional parents and so on and so forth.
I think I would have been a delightful kid and a happy adult.
I operate at 10% of my capacity because I have to dedicate 90% to futile pursuits
such as obtaining supply.
Such as coping with my rage.
Such as regulating my sense of self-worth, my ups and downs.
Such as coping with my mood disorders and with my lability.
It's depleting to be me.
It's depleting.
It's energy consuming and there's nothing left there for creativity, for happiness,
for interrelatedness, for having a good time.
Nothing is left there for this.
When I met my husband he was a sex toy designer, of all things, right?
I met a person that is, oh wow, super open with sexuality.
He wants to be intimate.
When he moved with me, a couple months before moving in with me he started rejecting me sexually
from one day to another.
That was his point of control, because he knew that was my trauma.
My trauma was having been with a previous man who rejected me sexually, too.
And that takes a hit in your self-esteem.
A regular person who doesn't have all these issues with intimacy, they can just hold you.
Anytime it's with a narcissist, there's a physical distance, it becomes a power trip.
The closeness scares them so bad that they will do anything to get away from you after.
It is such an awkward feeling to be a woman or a man and feel this rejection.
After all that matter that you tell them that they are good lovers.
Anything that happens to you is utterly–and I want you to understand, I'm using the
I'm using the word "utterly" judiciously.
Utterly alien to me.
Utterly.
I have no more mentally in common with you; then I have with a, let's say, with a long-necked giraffe.
They have an internal judge; we call it an inner critic or psychiatry would call it the superego.
That is saying "are you doing a good job of garnering narcissistic supply and maintaining
the god-like false image or are you failing?"
And they are either succeding and appeasing the angry god, or they're failing.
And it makes them feel absolutely worthless.
Their anxiety is, and I don't think it's too much to say, purely abandonment anxiety.
Their depression is purely narcissistic depletion.
What I call love is a combination of, actually fear, fear of abandonment
and fear of losing supply and disintegration.
Coupled with... kind of gratitude to the source for maintaining me.
The red flags of narcissistic abuse are something you feel, rather than see.
The interaction with the person will lead to a sense of anxiety, and a sense of potential danger.
Even though you can't see the danger.
And a kind of self-doubt.
Where you're going "hm, this seems to this way, but they are saying this, but it makes
me feel different to what they are saying".
They could be telling you something nice and paying you a compliment, but somehow you feel
threatened.
They could be saying that they are doing something for you, making a sacrifice for you, and yet
you feel ripped off.
You feel conned.
So if you outright take revenge on them, deliberately make an effort to take revenge on them, they
will make a project of you.
They will make a project of punishing you.
I have no home because he promised me to...
"Baby, don't get a home because you're gonna be getting one with me, so you don't have to."
So when I fly back from this trip to London, I am going back to no home.
He ruined my life.
If one were to decide to take revenge on a narcissist, to be so foolish.
What one would need to do would be to shift from the prey mindset to the predator mindset.
This is an alien way of thinking to the codependent.
Totally alien.
If you seek revenge, dig two graves. And that's very true.
The only thing you can have with prolonged contact with a narcissist is insanity.
You will go insane.
If you do it for years on end, you will become as sick, in a different way, as the NPD personality.
You will have a complete traumatic break with reality.
I would really wanna rip him physically apart little by little.
Maybe that's because what it feels like that he had been doing.
Like skinning.
Layer and layer.
 
I always say that for you to be a decent human being in Nazi Germany would have required you to have therapy.
Because it was a psychopathic society.
And that would have meant that being decent is a maladaptation.
"You are sick!
If you're decent, something is wrong with you."
I'm redundant to a narcissist.
They don't need me.
We could sit here and inside of five minutes come up with multiple ways of
exploiting vulnerable people.
If we chose to, if we were sick and psychopathic, we could do that.
We don't need to sit through a 2-day seminar to do that.
The only people who need to sit through a 2-day seminar are those who are looking to
heal, because that's difficult.
Abusing people is extremely easy.
I think, all in all, we are a very bad mistake.
Catastrophic and critical mutation.
Which is, frankly, overtaking the gene pool, the white house, and other places.
You should seek to have as little contact with them as possible.
And I mean, little, literally.
Whatever communication you have with them.
If you send them a text, less words are better.
If you have to speak to them, less words is better.
If it's a phone call, make it a shorter phone call.
I'm not being facetious or pedantic.
Any and all communication and any and all information you give is ammunition and it
will all be used or could be used against you at a later date.
Diminish contact as rapidly and as fully as you possibly can.
My 36 years, I have to cut them and start from zero basically but now with all this
and with the knowledge that I have...
I think it puts me into a place where I can...
I know now.
I need to come out of the situation.
And like I said, the only thing holding me back is...How do I do that carefully and causing
less stress for the children?
And then how do I maintain a good relationship with them?
I'm in denial.
I can't have the good without the bad.
And I just need to heal and recover and eventually...
I have faith that God will send me a normal person.
Healthy, I hope!
I help people to diagnose what narcissistic abuse is; it's effect, help them to heal from it
so they walk away from the subject.
I don't want them on forums in ten years time obsessing over NPD.
I want them to go and live their lives and move on.

I Left My Heart in San Francisco
[Music]
a city is so beautiful it's hard to
believe it's real
yet this is the same San Francisco
gritty
dystopian
it's underbelly fully exposed for the
world to see
so what are we to make of this place
for dual realities this extreme exists
side by side
this is San Francisco The Good The Bad
and The Ugly
San Francisco was founded on a Gamble
the population exploded in the 1850s
during the Gold Rush when people from
all corners of the world came in search
of its fortunes
the city was built on a narrow Peninsula
with the San Francisco Bay to the East
and the vast expanse of the Pacific
Ocean to the West
Ameris seven by seven square miles packs
in a dense cityscape built on and around
steep Rolling Hills
foreign
[Music]
Francisco's geography is really unique
and is characterized by its many many
many Hills there's something like 40
plus Hills in the city and as you can
see we are on one right now you really
gotta work your your legs your
hamstrings your butt to make it up them
but it's really common here and it's
just something that makes San Francisco
uniquely San Francisco
[Music]
getting up the hills requires a lot of
work but the really cool thing is once
you make it up them you get rewarded
with views like this right now we're at
Ina coolbuth Park there's amazing
panoramic views all over the city from
here you can see really famous San
Francisco landmarks all of downtown the
Salesforce Tower the Transamerica
Pyramid the Bay Bridge and Coit Tower
it's a really nice place to stop and
relax and Ponder the meaning of life
while observing a beautiful view in
front of you you can see the famous
Alcatraz prison over there and it's
really crazy to think about isn't it
it's a prison on an island in the middle
of the ocean across from a beautiful
dense hilly City
it it doesn't seem real
the Painted Ladies of San Francisco
dolled up in Greens pinks Blues every
color of the rainbow
and all the fashionable frills
minimalism isn't a word that exists in
your world you are the special sauce of
San Francisco what gives the streets of
this city its character and charm
you're full of secrets
carrying the stories of people who have
called you home their paths their
indulgences their sin
layered together these memories reveal
the complex past of an ever-changing
City
[Music]
we're in the hate Ashbury Neighborhood
in San Francisco where there's a high
concentration of Victorian architecture
and a lot of famous artists and
musicians have lived in this
neighborhood and called these colorful
victorians home
Janice Joplin lived here the Grateful
Dead lived here and Jimi Hendrix also
lived here so a lot of greats from the
hippie era
[Music]
between 1850 and 1910 there were an
estimated 40 to 50 000 victorians built
right here in San Francisco and many of
them were destroyed in the 1906
earthquake that is the biggest
earthquake in U.S history but a lot of
them also survived and now San Francisco
has the highest concentration of
Victorian houses anywhere in the world
[Music]
these victorians behind me are some of
our favorites in the entire city they're
called The Four Season victorians and
there's a couple characteristics that
make victorians so special including
ornate details both in and outside so on
the ones behind me you'll see a lot of
flower trimmings for example there's
also gingerbread trimmings a lot of
stained glass windows beautiful bay
windows that create space and give a lot
of beautiful light inside the houses as
well as turrets or these towers that you
see on some of the houses
fact is it okay before I was doing tours
I worked as a handyman and been a lot
done a lot of work in these houses and
it's amazing the level of craftsmanship
on the inside and when you look at a
hardwood floor that's nailed every six
inches with finishing nails done by hand
it's kind of amazing it was all done
with no power tool virtually no power
tools
[Music]
we are now in Alamo Square sitting
across from perhaps the most famous
victorians in all of San Francisco the
colorful painted ladies that were
featured in the opening of the Full
House series
[Music]
every single Victorian in San Francisco
has its own unique stories and this one
behind me is particularly interesting
you can see that it looks like a Gothic
fairy tale mansion
thank you
Charles Manson didn't live here but he
did come visit yeah our host Kelly has
lived in the house for over 20 years
Russians used to operate a bar out of
what is now his bedroom
and this is great the the piano is tuned
[Music]
all right that's the only thing I have
up my sleeves
the Westerfield House was built in the
late 1800s by wealthy German immigrants
it's seen many people come in and out at
stores
the founder of the Church of Satan made
films here has a Charles Manson tie
obviously and it has been home to many
many communes
its most recent owner made it a life
dream to purchase the house planned his
course of action during an acid trip and
has since lovingly restored it staying
true to its historical charm
[Music]
original work yeah I call I don't know I
call this Neptune but it is the original
Woodwork in the house and it's crazy to
think they probably did all this by hand
oh yeah yeah yeah this was Joe
definitely handcrafted this is the only
room that we know that uh somebody was
shot and killed in no way yeah under
what circumstances so this is uh the
breakfast room would have been the
original breakfast room the breakfast
murder room yeah yeah yeah that's before
breakfast yeah
laughs
[Music]
every major city in the world has one
the neighborhood that's a little rough
around the edges
the one the guidebooks tell you to skip
in San Francisco
that place is the tenderloin
so a lot of first-time visitors to San
Francisco don't realize that it's
actually a really gritty town and this
is kind of Ground Zero of that we are in
the tenderloin neighborhood which is
where a lot of the city's homeless
crisis is there's a lot of open drug use
and drug dealing and there's a lot of
crime here and people who come here
don't really know what to make of it and
it's located right in the heart of the
city right next to downtown in the major
shopping districts but there's really a
lot of different sides to San Francisco
there's the quirky architecture there's
all the history and the culture the
beautiful landscapes and then there's
this side which is a very real part of
the city as well
during the late 1800s the tenderloin
flourished as the raucous entertainment
Hub of the city
the party was abruptly halted by the
1906 earthquake which reduced vast
sections of San Francisco to Rubble the
tenderloin no exception
the neighborhood was quickly rebuilt and
among the Reconstruction came affordable
housing in the form of single room
occupancies
over the years a proliferation of
brothels porn theaters and a legal
gambling establishments transformed the
tenderloin into a caricature of Vice
fast forward to today and this
reputation remains so embedded in the
neighborhood's ethos that it is even
reflected in its name and Legend has it
that the tenderloin was coined back in
1876 by a corrupt police chief named
Alexander Williams now Chief Williams
was transferred from a more affluent
part of the city into the tenderloin and
would take bribes from the local
businesses mostly brothels in exchange
for police protection and he said
something along the lines of I used to
only be able to afford chuck steak with
my salary now with the bribes I'll be
able to afford chores deer cuts of meat
like the tenderloin and that's how the
myth goes and the name has stuck
foreign
[Music]
this is one of my first times walking
through the streets of the tenderloin we
usually just drive through and it's
really crazy I mean we get a little
desensitized to it in San Francisco but
you definitely don't see stuff like this
everywhere
the national media fixates on the
tenderloin and their claims are not
wrong
residents here sidestep encampments open
drug use and filth on the streets on
their way to work or school and running
a business here comes with its own
struggles
this is a really nice local market you
don't see a lot of full grocery stores
in the tenderloin it's usually a lot of
corner stores and there's kind of a food
desert here and establishments like this
provide fresh produce and fresh meat for
the neighborhood so what is it like to
work here just day to day our business
is slow down right
the people camping in front of our store
right so there's a lot of theft going on
yeah and then also just all the stuff on
the street prevents people from actually
coming in the store so it really impacts
businesses they feel no step when they
do this this way they go to another
another store do you feel safe working
here
uh no no no because you know when they
come to steal we have um fighting with
them right yeah yeah it's terrible and
do you think the local government helps
at all like do you see any government
action so try to help your business no
no even I call the police they don't
want to come we just call every day but
no one to come
yeah and then on that there's no
business
yeah well I'm really sorry to hear that
it's too bad yeah and do you live in the
tenderloin I have the little the I have
to move out of this area right now let
my daughter see every day that I did
please help us to yeah bring our
customers here
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
in the 1970s an influx of immigrants
from Southeast Asia arrived in the
tenderloin many of them were from
Vietnam Cambodian and Laos and they were
escaping the violence of warfare as well
as communist regimes so many of them
made their way to this neighborhood
because it was affordable there were a
lot of single room occupancies in the
neighborhood as well as low-cost housing
this wave of immigration brought us
tenderloins Little Saigon district and
restaurants like this one fall 2000 an
unassuming hole in the wall where
anti-serva Vietnamese Classics like thaw
and rice dishes when these immigrants
arrived in the tenderloin in the 70s the
neighborhood was essentially a concrete
jungle there were no playgrounds there
were no schools there weren't a lot of
grocery stores selling fresh produce so
these newcomers came and they built
businesses and restaurants that's one
example of how these communities have
made their Mark here
on the menu fresh spring rolls with
shrimp and sliced pork
and Pho with sliced beef tripe and other
fun bits perhaps the best bowl of fall
you can find in the city
this is a really beautiful bowl of
classic Vietnamese faux it's perfect for
this cold foggy day in San Francisco
[Music]
tenderloin is a neighborhood with big
problems that's undeniable
but multiple truths can co-exist and
there are parts that are full of life
and there's a community here actively
dedicated to making it a better place
so the tenderloin is home to a lot of
families and a lot of children and we're
standing outside of a playground and
it's a weekend day it's very bustly and
active there's a lot of people in there
and we were just talking to some members
of tenderloin safe passage and
essentially what they do is they hang
out outside the playground they're
familiar with their surroundings the
community people in the playground and
they just hang out and make sure that
everything is safe and that the
residents of the tenderloin are able to
enjoy a nice day at the playground so
that's very cool at a program like that
exists here
so how long have you lived in the
tenderloin I've been down here and seen
the change of everything my whole life
and
it's gotten better and worse to just
depending on Dynamics
yeah you know the homeless and the
street value it's gotten worse to a
point but it just it's it's still
everybody's still out here and still
moving and still walking and still
trying yeah and what do you think a lot
of people in the media
understand
like actually watching how everything is
moving we're actually getting in touch
and knowing people outside they just
judge a book by its cover right you know
and that's the worst thing because a lot
of these people there's a lot of people
that are in a messed up situation and
when you really talk to them they'll
tell you I have an apartment I have I
get checks but their mindset their
rather be where they're at not under
government's eyes paying taxes and doing
all that what do you wish people knew
about the tenderloin
I wish people knew that there was more
in the tenderloin than just homelessness
within just poverty and and drugs you
know I wish people would actually see
the light
[Music]
San Francisco is a city with a lot of
problems there's a lot of poverty and
blatant inequality at the same time it
is really naturally beautiful and full
of culture and history and a community
that's really invested in making it a
better place
so I would say San Francisco is a city
like any other it has its good it's bad
it's uglies it's just a little bit more
extreme than most places you would find
[Music]
[Music]

- [Dave] There's a black
man sitting in a desk
directly to your right.
Look at him.
- Morpheus?
- Sike!
(laughter)
It's Earl, I need your stapler.
I can't find mine.
(upbeat music)
- I worked at a couple
of fast food places.
Parked cars at wrestling.
I couldn't pay the rent
and I was too
ashamed to go home.
That's when I met Kit.
She was a hooker and
made it sound so great.
- Okay.
You gotta get the
(beep) outta here.
(laughter)
(laughter)
(sobbing)
- Molly.
Molly.
Molly.
- [Dave] Hey Molly,
your husband's clothes
fit funny, girl.
(laughter)
- Well they look better on
you than they ever did on him.
Why don't you take them off?
- Not a bad idea.
- Hm.
- You ready to get
some of this loving?
- [Molly] You bet your ass I am.
It's my dumb ass husband
who's dead, not me.
- You ready to step
into the jungle?
- [Molly] Oh yeah.
What do you say?
- [Dave] Oh man.
- [Man] Molly!
- Oh, you know I see you.
You know I, yeah I'm
looking right at you.
You, the ghost.
I see you.
You freaky man,
you like to watch?
You wanna watch?
How this make you feel?
(cheering)
- [Man] Man, I could
just slide a finger
down the crack of that ass.
(laughter)
- [Man] I wish my
boys could see this,
look at the ass on that.
- [Man] I'd like to have
doggy style sex with her.
(laughter)
- [Man] Damn, look
at her nipples man.
(laughter)
(laughter)
- [Boy] I would put a
hurting on that bitch.
(laughter)
(applause)
Damn!
(laughter)
(suspenseful music)
(phone ringing)
- Hello?
- [Earl] Hello Neo, do
you know who this is?
- Morpheus?
- [Earl] Yes.
I've been looking for you Neo.
I don't know if you're ready
to see what I want to show you
but unfortunately, you and
I have run out of time.
They're coming for you Neo
and I don't know what
they're going to do.
- Who's coming for me?
- [Earl] Stand up
and see for yourself.
(suspenseful music)
- Shit!
- [Earl] I can guide
you out of there,
but you must do
exactly as I say.
- Okay.
- [Earl] The cubicle
across from you is empty.
(suspenseful music)
Go, now!
(suspenseful music)
Stay there.
(suspenseful music)
When I tell you, go to
the end of the hall.
Stay as low as you can.
Now!
(farting sound)
(laughter)
(suspenseful music)
There is a black man
sitting in a desk
directly to your right.
Look at him.
- Morpheus?
- Sike!
(laughter)
It's Earl, I need your stapler.
I can't find mine.
(laughter)
Hello dumb dumb, do
you know who this is?
(laughter)
- Dude, you totally got me.
- Whoa.
(laughter)
(laughter)
(applause)
Please be seated.
Hello America.
As you all know, there's an
asteroid the size of Maine
speeding towards
Earth as we speak.
I'd like to take a
moment out of the day
to address the allegations
that this is somehow my fault.
(laughter)
Firstly, I'd like to say
that these allegations
are absolutely and 100% false.
Secondly and most importantly,
I'd like to say that
you mother (beep) disgust me!
You god damn right, I said it.
If you knew just
one of the things
I was sworn to secrecy too,
you would buckle under
the god damn pressure.
- Mr. President?
Like what?
- How about this?
I have here in my hand
the cure for AIDS.
We've had this for 25 years.
(gasping)
Have a great weekend.
(laughter)
Did I shock you?
Are you crazy yet?
Well, I have someone
I'd like you to meet.
Come on up here Paula.
America, I'd like you to
meet my good friend Paula.
And here's Paula again, and
here's Paula one more time.
We cloned these three bitches
in a laboratory in Seattle
some 19 odd years ago.
(laughter)
Not only that, we added
a pinch of black gene
so that they could
do things like this.
Hit it girls.
♪ Running through
the rain drops ♪
♪ Wishing that you won't stop ♪
- That'll be enough,
thank you very much.
All right baby.
Oh hold on, Paula.
Here's the cure for AIDS.
Sorry about last night.
(laughter)
You freaked out yet?
Have I blown your mind?
Or do you think you could
still handle my job?
Because if you're cocky
and you think that
you got hold of this,
I got some more
information for you.
Would you like to know
who killed Kennedy?
- Yes.
- Who killed Kennedy?
- [Dave] Ready for
the truth America?
Here it comes.
Oswald killed Kennedy.
That's right, Lee Harvey
Oswald killed John F. Kennedy
alone and by himself
with a magic bullet.
That's right, the bullet
was actually magical.
Magic does exist,
we've known about this for
some two thousand years.
I bet I blew your mind
right there, didn't I?
I'm really on a roll
when I don't care,
because the world's
gonna end any day now.
So I might as well introduce you
to a good friend
of mine, Bibble.
Bibble, come on up here.
- [Man] Oh my god,
is that an alien?
(laughter)
- America, this is Bibble.
Bibble is a space creature
that lives very far away
in a galaxy called Nebulon Five.
And he is solely responsible
for the wave of technology
we've seen over the
last few decades.
Cell phones, pagers,
Play Station one and two,
you might think it was the
Japanese who were responsible,
but anyone in the know,
knows that it was Bibble,
for shizzle, and all by Bibble
'cause only Bibble
could keep it so real.
(laughter)
Hey yo, Bibble is
the space ship ready?
- Yah, yah.
- I'm ready to get out of here.
Okay, me and Bibble
are about to leave.
But before we go,
I just wanna say
there's no hope for
the planet Earth.
There's no way to
stop the asteroid
and you're all gonna die.
Everyone except for me,
and of course Bibble,
who's been so kind to let me
accompany him on his spaceship
and I'm bringing those three
cloned white women with me.
Goodbye America.
I hope you all die
in a fiery death
when the meteor
hits next Tuesday.
Come on Bibble, let's
get out of here.
- Yah, yah.
(applause)
(classical music)
- What's with all
the stretching?
- Oh, you know,
all the old adage.
Big boobs, bad back.
- Yeah.
All set?
- I'm a little worried.
I didn't have a
clean sports bra,
so I had to wear a regular one.
- You'll be fine, let's go.
(drumming)
Don't worry Shelia, I'm
sure nobody notices.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- [Man] Look at that lady.
- [Man] Yeah, her
bassoons are like
bouncing around and everything.
(laughter)
- They're not talking about you.
- Sweet Jesus, did you see
the jugs on that brunette?
- I'm gonna go in.
- Shelia, it's okay.
- It's not okay.
(grunting)
It's not okay!
Stupid boobs!
Nothing but an inconvenience.
I wish I didn't have them.
(gasps)
- Careful what you wish for.
- What?
Who are you?
- Who I am is not important.
But what you said
about those titties is.
(laughter)
Follow me.
(magical sounds)
It's easy, try it.
- [Shelia] Hey, that's me!
And that's Frank,
the human resources
man at my office.
He's always slobbering over me.
- Not today.
- [Shelia] So that's
why I think I'm
qualified for the promotion.
- Yeah, well um, we'll see.
- Why is he being so dismissive?
What happened to my boobs?
(laughter)
- Oh, you just answered
your own question.
Them puppies is gone girl,
just like you wished for.
- How did it go?
- Not well.
That woman was a
flat chested boar.
Our clients will
never respond to her.
For Pete's sake,
she's got no melons.
- [Man] So should I tell her
she's not getting the promotion?
- Yes, in fact tell that
tit-less freak she's fired.
- Oh, I'm on it.
- Ugh, are guys
really like that?
- No.
- My guy friends
aren't like that.
(laughter)
- Buy aka.
- Oh, look it's Paul.
He's always been so helpful
to me, such a loyal friend.
Hey buddy.
I have a painting I need
to hang up in my bedroom.
Do you think you could help?
- Wow, I didn't even
know we were buddies.
I always thought I was
your personal handy man
'cause you're constantly
asking me for favors
that I don't wanna do.
You know what you need?
A new set of titties
and a boyfriend.
And you'll be all set all right?
(laughter)
What's gotten into him?
- Well, it's not
what's gotten into him,
as much as it is what's
gotten out of you.
And by that of course, I mean
your massive milk bladders.
- Paul wait, I still
have big boobs!
- He can't see you.
- We'll see about that.
(bell ringing)
- He can't see you, but my
black ass got 20/20 vision,
god damn Shelia!
- You men are the worst!
- You're right.
Oh my god Shelia, you are right.
Women, the fairer sex,
they would never ever
judge another woman by
the size of her boobies,
now would they?
Mazel tov.
(magical sounds)
- Hey wait, those
are my friends.
- Oh, were?
- Where's Shelia?
Wasn't she supposed
to be a bridesmaid?
- Oh, I was gonna have her
be one, but then I thought,
am I getting bridesmaids
starting in itty
bitty titty committee?
- Oh!
(laughter)
- I didn't even invite
her to my wedding.
- Oh snap!
(laughter)
- How could she do that?
- 'Cause your
friends are bitches.
Besides Shelia, even girls
love girls with huge tits.
(laughter)
- I had no idea these
things were so important.
- Oh, keep it real girl.
Them things are life savers.
Listen, I didn't
wanna put this on you
but the fate of the
world, you hear me,
the world rests on
them chestacles.
Shazam!
(alarm beeping)
- Hey, where do I know
that crazy guy from?
- He used to live
next door to you.
You know, masturbating to you
and those giant cans of yours
was all he had to live for.
Once you took that
away, he lost his mind
and blew up the world.
That's a lot Shelia.
- [Shelia] No!
No!
No, I don't want
the world to end
just because of my
sweater puppets.
- Aw, that's a
beautiful thought.
You should have
thought about that
before you wished
them sweet tits away.
The world's gonna end
in about 10 seconds.
Which is just enough
time to suck a titty.
But where would I
find a titty from?
I just, hey it's Shelia.
(screaming)
(birds chirping)
- You've taught me a
valuable lesson today.
I'm never going to
curse my fun bags again.
In fact, I might
even get implants.
- All right.
- You listen world, I've
got humongoid knockers
and I'm proud of them!
(applause)
Thanks Mister.
You must be an
angel or something.
- Angel?
I ain't no angel, I'm a janitor.
(keys jingling)
- [Shelia] Then how did you
show me all those places?
- Girl, I am high on PCP.
I just don't see how
you was following it.
You smoked some, a little some?
- No, who are you?
- I'm just a (beep)
that love titties.
Have a good day miss.
(applause)

- [WOMAN] ARE YOU FOR REAL?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

[BELL DINGS]

In 1819, a group of soldiers was 
digging a pit in Lompock Rancho,  
California to search for a powder magazine. 
Working their way through layers of hard,  
compact gravel, the soldiers found something 
out of place: a 12-foot sarcophagus. While  
this in itself was already a strange on its own, 
something even more shocking was hidden inside it:  
a skeleton of a giant human, measuring around 
12 foot tall as well, or about 5 meters.
In the same area, the soldiers found artifacts 
that may have been buried along with the giant  
skeleton. Weaponry, semi-precious minerals, and 
shells, on which strange symbols were engraved.
To top it off, they found that the skull 
has two rows of upper and lower teeth.
Not knowing what to do, the soldiers approached 
a local Native American tribe for assistance.  
Declaring it to be a remnant of a deity, the 
wary tribe asked them to bury the remains again  
and never to disturb it once more. True enough, 
once the authorities caught wind of the situation,  
they indeed re-interred the bones secretly. 
Nothing was heard of about it ever since.
This story was told by a woman in 1862. 
Her husband was one of the soldiers who  
unearthed the strange sarcophagus with a giant 
skeleton. The area has since then been turned  
into a military facility. Nowadays, it 
hosts the Vandenberg Space Force Base.
The 1819 story was just one of the 
many accounts of the supposed giant  
skeleton discoveries all across United States.
Giant stories are abound in many 
mythologies and cultures around the world.
Wherever you go, there’s almost 
always a tale about a giant or giants:  
larger or taller than normal humanoids with 
immense strength and power. In these stories,  
they usually play antagonistic roles, 
hostile and even openly violent to the  
humans they encounter. From Goliath 
of the Bible, to Ymir of the Norse,  
and to the Gigantes of the Greece, there’s no 
shortage of these larger than life stories.
The Americas is also no stranger to stories of 
gigantic humans. From Paul Bunyan to the Paiute  
legends of red-haired giants, there is no shortage 
of giant stories, each as bizarre as the other.
Nowadays, we look back at these stories as 
nothing more than myths and legends. After all,  
it’s hard to imagine that such 
creatures of colossal size once  
roamed the Earth. There is also no solid 
and verifiable proof that they did.
Or was there?
Archaeological Findings of Gigantic Proportions: 
The Mystery of America’s Giant Skeletons
Since the early 1800s, sightings of giant 
skeletons have popped up every now and then  
all over the country, with some, even 
earning a space in newspapers. Dozens  
of articles regarding giant skeletons were 
in newspaper archives, town history records,  
and journals of important people. Some 
of them, you can even find online.
In just a span of 200 years, over a thousand 
reports of skeletons with a height measuring  
at least seven foot or 2 meters up to 18 
feet or 5.4 meters tall have been found.
As you can see in this map, some states 
in the country have higher concentrations  
of giant skeleton accounts than 
others, with Ohio, in the lead. 
An anonymous internet user also collected 
newspaper clippings and reports of supposed  
giant skeletons in a publicly available 
spreadsheet. Based on their collected data,  
here’s a chart that shows the states and some 
countries with the most giant skeleton sightings:
You can check out the links to the spreadsheet 
and the map in the video’s description.
While most of these have 
been chalked up to hoaxes,  
exaggerations, or misidentifications, 
others can’t be so easily dismissed.
Among these, are the few accounts 
that stood above the rest. Some,  
for its believability, while 
others for its eerie similarity  
to old Native American legends. Then 
there are those that combine both.
A 1947 newspaper also reported a strange 
account of a retired Ohio physician by the  
name of Dr. F. Bruce Russel. According to the 
article, Dr. Russel, alongside his colleague  
Dr. Daniel S. Bovee, was prospecting an area 
in Death Valley, California to look for mining  
opportunities in 1931, when he fell into an 
underground cave when the ground beneath him  
gave away. What he stumbled upon in that place was 
something he never would have imagined finding.
Because underneath that seemingly ordinary area 
was a complex network of catacombs and tunnels.  
Bovee joined Russel in exploring the caverns, 
only to find even more mysterious artifacts,  
bones of extinct animals, and mummified 
remains of giants measuring 8 to 9 feet tall.
Naturally, when Russel and Bovee told this 
story to others, nobody believed them. Russel,  
however, was persistent at first and even formed 
a corporation with the goal of exploring the said  
cavern network even further and profitting off 
from it. Unfortunately, they never found it again.
But the story didn’t end there. Only a short 
while after that, Russel disappeared. His  
car and suitcase was found abandoned in a 
far flung area in Death Valley. Meanwhile,  
his companion Bovee wasn’t heard of since the 
incident, as if he vanished into thin air.
Russel and Bovee weren’t even the only 
ones to tell such tale. In the 1920s,  
there was also another prospector, only known 
as White, who fell into a cavern and discovered  
evidence of civilization in the place. 
Later on, a Paiute native named Tom Wilson,  
was fascinated by White’s tale as it’s similar 
to his grandfather’s story. Wilson accompanied  
White to find the mysterious caverns but 
they weren’t able to locate it anymore.
A book published in 1932 titled Death Valley 
Men by a prospector named Bourke Lee also  
recounted the same story. Like the others, the 
men who visited the underground city vanished.
Interestingly, 577 miles away from Death 
valley, a similar story happened in 1904 to a  
British prospector only known as J.C. Brown. Like 
Russel, Bovee, White, and Wilson’s grandfather,  
J.C. Brown accidentally discovered a cave where 
he found not only treasures and artifacts,  
but also mummies of giants measuring up to 
10 feet or 3 meters tall. Strangely, Brown  
also vanished on the day he and an exploration 
team was about to set out to return to the area.
Stories of underground cities and giants actually 
have their roots in Native American legends. The  
Paiute people even have a legend about a chief 
who, grieving for the death of his beloved wife,  
wandered to the Death Valley and stumbled 
upon an underground city called Shin-Au-Av.
While this tale from the Paiute people 
don’t have giants on the surface,  
another one has a more direct mention of 
beings who are larger than normal humans.
According to a story told to mining engineer 
John T. Reid in 1886, the Paiute people once  
fought a war against a tribe they called 
the Si-Teh-Cah. The Si-Teh-Cah, or the S’ai,  
are a tribe of red-haired cannibalistic giants who 
terrorized the area. The Paiute people eventually  
emerged victorious and drove them away to a cave, 
burying its entrance to prevent the giants escape.
That place is now known as the Lovelock Cave.
A link to a detailed video about the Giants of 
the Lovelock Cave can be found in the description.
Unlike our previous stories, though,  
there might be some veracity to 
the story of the Si-Teh-Cah people.
You see, in 1911, two bat guano miners, 
David Pugh and James Hart stumbled upon  
the remains of the tribe. Beneath the 
layer of bat guano measuring 3 to 6  
feet were thousands of artifacts and 
remains that was clearly left there by  
a sizeable settlement. One sandal was 
even estimated to be 10,000 years old,  
which was even older than the recognized 
most ancient civilizations in the world.
And while there is unfortunately scant 
evidence that the tribe who used to live  
there were actual giants, one of the 
remains discovered in 1911 was that of  
a 6 foot 6 inches tall human. Not exactly 
a giant, but a little taller than average.
However, there was a catch. Not all artifacts and 
remains of that cave were preserved. The problem  
started when during the first exploration of the 
miners, only the objects they deemed interesting  
were saved. So, as misfortune would have it, long 
before any systematized digging was done, there  
may have been many valuable artifacts that were 
irreversibly damaged and forever lost to time.
It turns out that cases similar to 
this isn’t exactly uncommon. A lot  
of reported discoveries of giant skeletons 
all across the country mysteriously ran into  
an issue and were declared to be hoaxes. 
Granted that many might have been a hoax,  
there are others that makes you question 
whether there’s a deliberate cover up.
Mounds and Giants
Mounds are a sizeable pile of earth artificially 
constructed as either a burial or ceremonial  
site. A mysterious earthwork that confounded 
the ordinary folks and archeologists alike,  
mounds have existed in North America for thousands 
of years. According to estimates, there were 1  
million mounds all over the United States, but 
only a hundred thousand of them remain nowadays.
Even in the 1800s, there were many people 
who believed that a race of giants have  
actually built these mounts. Among these 
was Abraham Lincoln, who famously wrote:
But still there is more. It calls up the 
indefinite past. When Columbus first sought  
this continent – when Christ suffered on the cross 
– when Moses led Israel through the Red-Sea – nay,  
even, when Adam first came from the hand 
of his Maker – then as now, Niagara was  
roaring here. The eyes of that species of extinct 
giants, whose bones fill the mounds of America,  
have gazed on Niagara, as ours do now. 
Co[n]temporary with the whole race of men,  
and older than the first man, Niagara is strong, 
and fresh to-day as ten thousand years ago. The  
Mammoth and Mastodon – now so long dead, 
that fragments of their monstrous bones,  
alone testify, that they ever lived, have 
gazed on Niagara. In that long – long time,  
never still for a single moment. Never dried, 
never froze, never slept, never rested.
Interestingly, it was also during this time that  
accounts of giant skeleton discoveries 
were reported in various newspapers.
More intriguingly, two of 
them came from New York Times.
According to these two articles dating back 
1886 and 1897, skeletons attributed to a giant  
human-like creature were found in Cartersville, 
Georgia and Wisconsin, respectively. The Georgia  
skeleton measured 14 feet or 4.3 meters, while 
the Wisconsin one was around 9 feet or 2.7 meters.
While you can still read these newspaper 
articles in the New York Times website,  
strangely, there were no updates since of what 
happened to the two reported giant skeletons.  
It was as if the newspaper mentioned it once 
then decided not to talk about it anymore.
One of the most fascinating mound sites in the 
country, the Great Serpent Mound, also has its  
share of giant skeleton story. In the 1890s, 
Professor Frederic Ward Putnam found 6 feet tall  
skeletons near the area. While that’s not gigantic 
by any means, another researcher named Jeffrey  
Wilson rediscovered and photographed a 7 foot 
skeleton. Weirdly enough, the said skeleton had  
its lower leg and feet missing, which led some to 
speculate that it may have been taller than that.
More and more giant skeletons were found in 
various mound sites all over the United States.
One, in West Virginia, a 7 
feet 2 inches tall skeleton.
Another, in Miamisburg, Ohio, which was a 
skeleton of 8 feet and 1.5 inches in height.
Then, one in Iowa, measuring 7 feet and 6 inches.
The last one had reportedly crumbled 
to dust after exposure to air.

or are they simply the product of myths 
and hoaxes? You'll find out more about  
the controversies and theories that divide 
scientists and enthusiasts. Get ready for

Georgy, get up... you're late!
No breakfast,if you're not up now!
That is it! No breakfast!
Don’t be cruel mom, I’m up!!
George Patrao, you’re getting on my nerves!
Move it!
But mommy my stomach hurts!
That’s because you eat so much!
Stop being a glut from now on and Hurry up!
Hi, my name is George, and as you heard,
she’s my mom, an excellent cook and I
want to be like her when I grow up!
However, she just doesn’t understand me!
Georgggyyyyyyy!!!!
See, this is exactly what I’m saying!
What is this?
Toast!
I know its toast.
But I don’t only eat toast for breakfast.
I eat it with my sunny side up
and six cocktail sausages!
When people have upset stomachs,
this is what they eat!
But what does having an upset stomach, got
to do with me, having my routine breakfast?
Mom, Mom, Mom?
Like I told you before,
I have no respect
in this house, no one
takes me seriously.
How can I have something
so insipid for breakfast?
Sometimes I’m just waiting
on the world to change!
Yes!!!
My Life Ends Today!!!!
You’re not only a glut, you’re a clumsy
glut, junior patrao! Mark my wo..
Now tell me one thing, did I
deliberately drop the nutella? Did I?
But still she won’t listen.
Her day starts with the yelling and
ends with the yelling.
It’s Yell ’o’ mania in here!
Heaven! Help Me!
Why don’t we start afresh,
Hi, my name is George Patrao.
People call me Georgy, actually,
Georgy Porgy.
Have you heard the nursery rhyme,
Georgy Porgy pudding and pie?
Kissed the girls and made them cry?
When the boys came out to play
Georgy Porgy ran away.
Have you heard it?
No?
Never mind.
At least I know my poem.
Good Morning Uncle!
There! They are late again!
And she thought I’d be late!
Women I tell you!
My mommy and daddy asked me yesterday,
what would I become when I grow up?
And you know what I said?
No prizes for guessing, A chef!
Thats correct, Eddy my boy!
Don’t you do that ever again!
Ha Ha Ha…
What will you do if I touch you?
Ummm!!
Ha Ha Ha!
Anyway so Eddy’s right!
I want to become a chef when I grow up.
I love everything about food.
Hot corn on the cob, An oozing soft-boiled
egg, A freshly baked chocolate cake.
Ummm I’m in food heaven!!!
And I want to cook all of this,
and much much more!
Yes!!!
Oh no, here comes jumbo the elephant!
Oh my god, there won’t be
any place for us now!
I’m changing my car pool from tomorrow, I
will die of suffocation when fatso enters.
Eweeeeeeeeeeee!!!!
Ha Ha Ha…Good one Georgy!
Serves them right!
We could have worked with
a little lesser stench,
but all in all, it was a cracker!
Ha Ha Ha Ha....
How was my day at school, right?
Terrible!!! I hate school.
You know, I’m planning to quit school
and go to catering college.
I’m fed up of being called
names all the time.
First those irritating
friends at school,
and here this mommy.
Do you know why I came
running into the room?
Wait and Watch.
George Patrao, are you a child who went
to school or a pig who went to a sty?
Because I personally think,
you are the latter.
And pigs are so fat
they do not need to eat anything.
So because of this state of yours, no
dinner for you tonight and that is final!
How can a mother compare her child
to an animal, moreover a pig!
Do I look like a pig. Do I?
Never mind I’m just going to leave everyone
and live by myself
when I become a famous chef.
And when they all come to say sorry to me,
I’ll think about it!
But I love Eddy, he’s my bestest
and sweetest friend.
I’m thinking to make him my  partner when
I open my restaurant, in mom’s words,
“ And that is final.”
Gerogy, I hope you have changed?!
That side,if you please.
Homework! I hate it.
Haven’t we done enough work in school?
No, but they want us to come home
and work all over again.
They are just mean, I say!
Calm down Georgy,calm down
calm down.
With today’s remark of the dirty uniform,
I can afford two more...
before mom and daddy are called to school.
I’m pretty ok!
Eddie my boy have I ever told you,
what good timing you have!
God please tell me, who shall be the den
in this very very game.
A,E,I,O,U and that spells you!
Oh man!
What was that!
Well I just know it, it’s
not for the lowly you know!
But never mind that, why is
it always my den, oh man!
Ha Ha Ha...Yes!
Colour Colour, which colour do you want?
I want the colour....
fuchsia pink!
You’re out!
I said You’re out!
That is cheating; I'm never going to play
this game, if you continue to...
wear those stupid multi colored pajamas.
Ooo I’m so scared, for
your kind information,
these are not pajama’s
these are bermuda’s!
Kids!
Ok ok, sorry,
but you know how much I hate this game!
Can we please play something more fun?
Pleaseeeee.
See, I listened to you for Colour Colour.
Now it’s my turn.
I know you’re always fair Edgar, Right?
That is correct! I’m always fair!
Hello everyone! Welcome to “I love to Eat”.
I George Patrao and along with me my
assistant Edgar Viscount welcome you.
Like I always say, I love to eat,
and so should you.
If you eat what I tell you to,
happiness will come to you.
That?
He assures you!
That is correct Eddy!
You know what, I’m thinking to make
some yummerlicious mushrooms...
which are so
buttery and cheesey! Ummmm!
Oh how exciting!
I love how Eddy is always so happy.
Nevermind, you know what we are
cooking today is my favorite,
its called
‘Mushroom and Cheese, Yes Please’.
Shall we start!
I said, shall we start?
Actions speak louder than words,
for your kind information!
You’re reply should be ‘Yes Chef’!!
Yes Chef!
That’s much better, we shall finally start!
Georgy are you sure you’re
allowed to do that?
Or do you even know how to?
Would you ask Ms Phoebe if she
knows how to teach!
Ha Ha..Of course not, how foolish!
Ummm...
Ok I get the point!
Yes!!!
Butter please!
Here we put in some sunshine yellow butter
and hear it crackle.
Ummm...
Eddy my boy, now these mushrooms
are in your court.
Haa! Thank you George, I mean chef.
What we have here are mushrooms
Do you know, mushrooms have
very less calories and
contain approximately
80 to 90 percent water.
At the same time, they have low sodium,
carbohydrate, fat content and high fiber.
This is the reason why
mushrooms are considered
good for those aiming at weight loss.
Thank you for the non-sensical
information overload!
Georgy, If you stir it
at that rate, they’ll
be more of ‘Mash’ rooms than mushrooms!
And here we put some pepper and salt.
How I wish I were a mushroom.
Ok Eddy g..o..
No no no...we do not
have time to listen
to your full bed time
story on cheese.
Georgy, I’m never going to play
this idiotic girly game ever again..
where you wish you were a mushroom!
How Foolish...
Stop being a winger and hand me the grater.
Will you play again?
Bowl Please...
This is what I get for
doing something I love!
Why mommy and daddy think cooking
is only for girls? I don’t think so.
This small wonder, has helped
so many people when they are sad.
Imagine making something
yum with it, all the time,
so that people are always
smiling and happy!
Wow, Wouldn’t that be lovely!
No matter what mom and
dad say, I know I want
to be a chef when I grow up. And I will!
Can I show you something? Just one minute!
This is what I call my treasure chest.
Let me tell you a secret,
it has all the recipes
which I’ve been collecting for many years.
Please, don’t tell anyone,
it is just between you and me ok? Thankyou.
On that note, I’ll take your leave.
But remember to tune into, I love to eat,
same time, same place, primetime.
Thank you and good night.
Are you back? Are you?
Yes, you are!
Just one more thing, follow your dreams,
no matter what anyone says,
and eat what you love,
and love what you eat.
Actually that is, actually
that’s three things.
So let’s meet soon, ok bye,
and remember, primetime!!
Ummm, Georgy my boy, you
indeed have a talent.
Wow, option number one, 
air force pilot
option number two, Yes Chef!!

I think I've been to the murders of it
at least eight kids that I can think of
off the top of my head and those are
some of the hardest ones patience is
gone you can't eat you can't sleep every
part of your life is disrupted
it was tough to remind me of my friends
kids and I couldn't get the screams in
my head for months
our bad day in the average bad day are
two different things
our bad day usually involves something
horrendous carnage and usually there's a
lot of blood and death got a call for a
VSA infant and the child was one and a
half two years old and the circumstances
were it was odd when we got there and
there's a little girl lying on the
ground and her mom was bawling and
freaking out on the phone doing CPR the
kid was blue and the dad standing like I
don't know what's happening it's over
there I remember I was driving home from
shift and I got a call from the platoon
chief from the other ships saying oh
yeah by the way that the dad snapped her
neck and murdered her you need to write
a witness statement after two weeks of
smelling rotting corpses in the
Philippines after Hurricane Honda we
were on a road going to deliver an
inflatable hospital up to the different
region and as we were driving down the
road a dog came out of the woods with a
small child's arm in its mouth that
hadn't found off of the corpse that's
been there for a month and that was its
food we got on scene and turned out this
kid have been cross-checked headfirst
into the boards had been unconscious and
we got there and he'd been removed from
the ice when I'm talking to this kid I'm
kneeling beside him looking in his face
he tells me he could feel everything
till they moved Oh
sorry seen that kids face just about
every facet of everyday life changes and
then the biggest thing to me is the loss
of innocence you realize that these
things happen in the world and they're
happening all around you all of the time
I felt like I was really armed to fight
fires to go to medicals to do all these
things but they didn't army with
something that I didn't realize was
gonna affect me so much was dealing with
the human nature of the calls and your
own emotions and how to react to these
things US police EMS we try and be the
tough guys and tough people and we are
affected by this it does have a
cumulative effect and it's not just one
call it's one call piled on the next
call piled on the next call and it's
like a house of cards and you try and
put that last card on the top and
everything comes down you're going to
experience things that you would wish
and hope that you never experienced
you're gonna see things that you can't
reverse that are going to be ingrained
on who you are lost myself into keeping
busy became a very much a workaholic
spent all my time just being busy so I
wouldn't have to think about things I
had a lot of guys that I work with who'd
been through similar things and and we
just we used to get drunk all the time
you just hung out with people who were
equally as damaged as you so you felt
normal and there was some comfort in
that so there was the black humor around
the fire hall people would joke about
things and that happens to this day I
learned really quickly though to just
kind of shut it all out and shut off
your emotional response to anything and
that transferred into my personal life
I didn't want to be anywhere near
anybody
just even my own family I just kind of
pulled back a lot if I know that there
were times that I have come home from
events that my children knew I was
coming home from that they they stayed
at a distance from me because they they
didn't know either what to say what to
do or if I was going to snap so to speak
and not be myself it's stuff that we
take for granted day-in day-out that you
see over of course your career and what
you do that it's taken away from other
people and what you realize is you're
responding to the worst event of their
lives but you're responding after the
incident already took place and there's
nothing you could have done by the time
you've reacted it had been called to
this call to change the outcome you can
just do the best that you can do while
you're there I know I've talked to
people and said listen like I went to
this counselor and changed my life and I
wish I went to her the first day I had a
bad call and I my life wouldn't be as
painful as it had to be we're a team
everything we do when we go out that
door we do as a team there's no one
individual that can do this job any part
of it on their own we do this together
and we need to hold on to that when we
come back to the hall you need to find
that network of people that you can
count on that you can trust that will be
there for you no matter what and those
are the people that you keep closest to
you throughout your career and
throughout your life I didn't really
know what to expect of the fire service
other than it was service based I mean I
know that through military movies that
there were such things as shell-shocked
and that sort of thing which you know
they're calling PTSD their experiences
that stick with you and I guess affect
you
sometimes long after those calls have
happened post-traumatic stress disorder
is an anxiety disorder that usually
develops after an individual has
experienced a traumatic event what are
the major problems is that when people
are involved in critical incidents it
may be their job to be dealing all the
time with critical events traumatic
events that to other people would seem
completely overwhelming they are
expected to deal with every day and
because that's part of their job
description it's very difficult for
people to say I think I've had enough I
have reached my limit it's not just the
firefighting division that deals with
these stressors that our Communications
Division as well as their the initial
call takers and a lot of times they're
on the phone with the victims they're
hearing things and they don't have the
ability to visualize or to have a
conclusion that we are allowed to
witness there are also some stressors in
fire prevention that they have to deal
with as can be in training if there's
ever accidents on the training ground so
it's important that we remember it's not
just the firefighting Division but all
of our divisions can't experience these
types incidents and that there is
support for all of them out there
they're not sleeping at night they're
not getting good rest they're becoming
agitated jumpy sometimes they become
angry irritable as anyone would be when
they haven't had good sleep they may
also lose their appetite or eat too much
people sometimes try to medicate
themselves with alcohol or drugs
some people will overeat some people
will overwork they may notice the
deterioration in their relationships and
they may also notice a deterioration in
their ability to focus function at their
job even if they've been working at the
same job for years unfortunately a lot
of guys self-medicated with booze
that was what was available it was sort
of socially acceptable or whatever you
know so if you had a bad call over the
course of your shift a lot of times to
go out guys to go for drinks afterwards
and you knew they were drinking more
than they normally would or acting
inappropriately just it was a now I
would recognize it as a stress reaction
to the call they'd been on I had no
patience whatsoever and I could fly off
the handle out my kids or my wife over
this the simplest silliest instances but
they didn't understand sleeping patterns
completely disrupted where I've not been
able to sleep because I can't turn my my
brain off when I put my head on the
pillow there's a lot of dark moments a
lot of lost sleep some nightmares a lot
of thinking like I say and some drinking
and you know curtness you lose your
temper faster and you don't know why
well it's probably cause you're stressed
because of the situation that you were
involved in but you just didn't have an
outlet to or the knowledge to know how
to fix yourself wait you're not alone
because there's so many people that are
going through the same sort of issues
that that I did and it all depends
whether or not you want to seek help or
not and I'm saying why not because it's
there so the resources available for our
members if they are in distress is our
team which we have roughly 20 people on
our team it's a critical incident stress
management team it's a peer driven by
ourselves and we have four members on
each squad so there's four squads as
well we have some members in the
communications division as well as the
training division and fire prevention we
have our CIS team now which is very much
helpful
the debriefings after work always you
know you're always open up to ask
questions talk to somebody
we are family at work you talk to that
person that's been on there your big
brother hey we've all seen you know
we've all done it we just don't know how
to in effect what doesn't what affects
me doesn't affect you what affects you
might not affect me at all each person
has their own little quirk and what will
set them off on what will cause them to
have some bad times and so some of those
things shared with another person who
knows exactly how it is in that kind of
context makes a great deal of difference
it also makes it possible to then
approach someone who's outside who can
be a counselor who that maybe is a
social worker a psychologist someone
who's outside who specifically helps
people debrief from these traumatic
events to help you I deal with them
differently now by opening up the
dialogue and I think the stigma of of
talking about anything other than being
happy on the job and you know I was a
good burn that's crazy call and actually
you know opening up about it
those walls are slowly breaking down and
like our peer counseling that alone is
is huge and offloading the stuff and so
you don't have to carry it and I mean
I've gone for counseling before just
recently in the last couple years and
that was kind of when I started to
address all this stuff I've been
carrying for a decade another important
facet that I find is support at home you
we try and make sure that somebody has a
spouse or sibling or a good friend that
is there that has that ability to
provide them support for when we are off
duty I think there's a a whole support
mechanism that you're leaving out of the
picture if you eliminate your family
from it that whole don't mention it at
home I don't think is a good idea
I believe talking to your spouse is as
important as talking to somebody from
who you work with again they're the ones
who live with you every
they're the ones are going to see the
change in your behavior they're the ones
who have to deal with the change in your
behavior it talking to them will give
them an understanding maybe as to what
what's bothering you
they're gonna be your biggest supporter
seen a lot done a lot and everybody will
drain your career and say it's now that
we have avenues to help us get over some
bad situations you know it's just like
any tool that we use on a firetruck you
know it's just another tool to help you
get through and heal yourself and take
advantage so if members are experiencing
distress whether on duty or off duty
they can get a hold of us as a team we
do have our numbers available on the
intranet so each squad has its certain
representatives from our team they can
look up their numbers on the intranet so
it's just available to our membership if
they're off duty and at home there is my
number and email that's always available
and I can then pass it on to another
member that is on their squad if they
need to deal with them directly or I can
afford them the information from
Chapelle our current EAP if they do have
to take that route most of the time
we're just doing defusing which is peer
support when we do go to that next stage
which is the briefings or if it's a
crisis one-on-one then we bring in our
mental health professionals that are
trauma counseled trauma counselors and
they're trained in that field so that is
their specialty and it does help break
the stigma when we do have known faces
in the halls for our membership there's
this fear of being different than the
rest of the people or seeming less tough
but the two toughest firefighters ever
met we're two captains I work with and
one I had for five years the other one
ice I work with for eight years on and
off it was a good friend of mine and
they both killed themselves and they
were the toughest guys I've ever met
so you know there's something to be said
to be able to open up and let it go
when you need to I think anybody around
here now is going to reach back and try
and help as much as they can
don't don't bottle it up and take it
home nothing Goods gonna come out of
that I think Oh opening up about this
dealing with it yeah just talking about
it can relieve a lot of the stress that
goes along with any of these issues
don't be afraid to admit that you need
out because people around you that are
close to you they see it and all it
takes is for you to be honest with
yourself and accept the fact that you're
only human to the fire service really is
that family that we all talk about and
there are people who really care and who
really want to see you succeed and I
think the it's important to know that
they're there but it's also important to
feel comfortable to reach out and let
them know when you need a bit of
direction or a bit of advice because
they won't know unless you tell them
you
you
you

Mark Cavendish is gonna burst for the line
The Manx-missile is back!
 Just look at this, this is the man they call the 
Max Missile, the fastest man in the world
what a  delivery by Mark Cavendish, this man is unstoppable, 
he came past the rest with unbelievable acceleration
Unbelievable stuff! Mark Cavendish
When he sees the finish he is absolutely 
impossible to beat. Mark Cavendish gets his 13th victory in the Tour de France
He's just an unbelievable finisher, the fastest sprinter on the planet
Mark Cavendish has cemented himself as the greatest sprinter of all time following his miraculous comeback last year
at the age of 36, he became cycling weekly's rider of the year  
and in the eyes of many he's become an icon 
of the sport
his resume lacks little, and  includes more than 150 professional wins, a third of those are grand tour stages
the Manx missile was born to sprint  
a pure sprinter who is equipped with fast 
twitch muscle fibers allowing him to accelerate  
instantaneously with explosive power, and reach 
top speeds of nearly 80 kilometres per hour  
growing up in the Isle of Man, Mark developed a 
passion for speed, but his speed is just one of  
the many keys to his success
 over 70 percent 
of the sprinter's work goes into fighting drag  
that's where aerodynamics come into play
professional teams spend so much time effort 
and money studying their riders positions on  
the bike looking for ways to improve them. 
However, using an aero position in a sprint  
comes with a cost, for most riders this is 
not a comfortable position for sprinting  
because it lowers the maximum power 
that can be generated this explains  
why many sprinters prefer more comfortable 
flexible and less aerodynamic positions  
maintaining such a low profile while sprinting is 
hard, but for a short guy like cavendish it's his  
natural sprinting position he makes no effort 
to maintain it
Mark Cavendish is being challenged by Robbie McEwen, but htis is the new Robbie McEwen
pure sprinters, and there aren't many, and i think he  he took it to another level
one of the big things about that makes Cav so successful 
his actual body shape and the way he's positioned 
on the bike makes him so incredibly aerodynamic  
he's got pretty short legs and and short little 
arms and it just puts him into this aerodynamic  
position without having to sort of contort his 
body to try and get down and get aerodynamic  
just by reaching down into the drops, makes 
him look like a time trial helmet on a bike  
his small size allows him to get the most out 
of slipstreaming others while they hardly get  
any drafting advantage out of riding on his wheel 
Caleb Ewan adopted a similar posture and took it to the extreme 
it proved to be very effective 
giving him a 15% advantage in terms of speed  
compared to standard sprinting positions. Because 
these two riders are super aero and comfortable at  
the same time they are able to compensate the 
gap in power against much more powerful peers  
he doesn't need to put out the same sort of power 
as someone like Greipel for instance  
who's for the cycling people he's putting 
out something like 1800 watts
or Kittel who's putting out 1800 or 1900 watts. Cav can go the 
same speed by putting out 1350
Even for the casual viewer his sprinting style is noticeably 
different from the rest it's not just his smooth  
and perfectly circular pedaling but also the way 
his core stays centered his head is barely moving  
like a sprinting cheetah limiting the amount 
of air disturbance around him and keeping air  
resistance at a low. But that doesn't mean his body 
is inflexible during the sprint and while he's  
having a tight grip on the handlebars his elbows 
are freely moving swinging his bike left and right  
in what he calls 'bringing the bike to the feet' 
in order to achieve maximum sprinting efficiency
on an ideal day, Cavendish would have a 
number of teammates do the work for him  
as the race approaches the finish. It's called a 
lead out train, their job is to keep the race under  
their control and carry Mark to the 200 meters to 
go marker. When the train is lined up each rider is  
doing nearly 40 percent less effort than the rider 
in front of him, by sitting at the back Cavendish  
can travel at the same speed as the rider at 
the front while barely pedaling. He doesn't  
necessarily need a team around him in order 
to get a win but it makes his job a lot easier  
Cavendish is a man who calculates every detail in 
his head, like anyone who is obsessive-compulsive  
he wants everything to be perfect. In an old 
interview Mark said: it's not just about my frontal  
area in a sprint, it's everything beforehand, how 
i ride in the peloton, my pedaling action, how I  
sit, I save so much energy for the finish. Mark 
does very minimal effort throughout the day  
when there's a possible sprint at the 
end of the stage he doesn't put 100  
effort into the intermediate sprints even if the 
two sprints are hours apart at the end of the race  
he knows exactly how deep he can go and he's not 
only good at managing effort throughout the race  
he also excels at managing his efforts 
throughout the final sprint as well  
when he's fresh he could pull off an 18 second 
sprint while an exhausted Cavendish might prefer  
jumping on the wheels of other sprinters and 
launch the sprint a few seconds later the length  
of the sprint depends on that and also depends 
on the wind direction and steepness of the road  
these variables make each and every sprint 
different. Going for long distances requires a  
wise distribution of effort, and as he once said: 
it's not about your absolute maximum wattage  
it's about how long you can hold that high wattage 
for the whole sprint. Given the uniqueness of  
each finish there is no set range from which you 
always open up the sprint knowing exactly when to  
attack is one of Cavendish's greatest weapons it's 
impressive how he times his sprint to perfection  
when the finish line is within sight riders can 
easily misjudge distance as nervousness takes over  
a common mistake is to go for a long way out 
which could work in your opponents' favor  
the most likely result is a defeat
Unless it's tailwind
Cavendish decides to light it, he's gonna go long
here comes Cavendish, his head down, he's running for the line
maybe Viviani has to battle and go for minor places here, but is it gonna be Mark Cavendish as he heads for the line
oh the right jersey makes it in the lead
in this sprint Cannondale the team in 
green were counting on their lead-out  
train to deliver their man to the 200 
meters point. But Cavendish decides  
to open up the sprint from 350 meters out 
surprising everybody with a very early jump  
when everybody started accelerating he had 
already picked up momentum and was on a par  
with them in terms of position had he waited 
till the 200 meters marker to launch his sprint  
winning would have been impossible. He was able 
to cover that distance in 15 seconds that's a  
very long range but thanks to the tailwinds and 
the surprise factor he managed to pull it off
in some rare situations Mark prefers 
not to sprint in the center of the road  
specifically when he finds himself at the 
front of the pack with a long way to go  
after getting delivered by a lead out. He launches 
the sprint from the center of the road then goes  
sideways with a closer look you'll notice a 
number of riders sitting on his slipstream  
once he switches lanes they follow which 
creates an overcrowded area that causes  
a bunch of his opponents to get boxed in they 
eventually miss out on the sprint. In other words  
he just brings a random portion of riders that 
may threaten his chances of winning to a halt  
however he has received a ton of criticism 
in the past for this aggressive style  
switching lanes and improvising in mid-sprint 
are also some of the actions he tends to take  
when he's badly positioned or when he 
realizes he might have gone too early  
he is very good at picking wheels 
that have the best potential  
he looks left and right searching for sweet 
spots for riders to use as shelter from the wind
when he spots one he goes for it sits 
on the slipstream to take a breath  
and relaunches the sprint shortly afterwards
Viviani being dropped a little bit too far back 300 meters to go. 
300 meters to go now it looks like Alexander  
Kristoff on the left hand to the center of 
your screen sat in the saddle powering along  
he opens up his sprint now Mark Cavendish is on 
the wheel of Alexander Kristoff, Viviani on the  
left-hand side Kristoff goes Cavendish
in the middle, Cavendish in the middle  
Cavendish takes it what a victory for the Manxman 
wow what a sprint that was!
 it's now or never time, the bells have rang and this is the time you've got to go or just pack up and go home
Cav gets himself into position Haussler is
there oh my life
a millimetre could decide a 300 kilometre race, such cases are 
not uncommon in professional cycling
the bike throw may not be Cavendish's most 
powerful weapon but it is there whenever  
he needs it and it's something 
that every cyclist should master  
it's a technique that allows the rider to have 
an edge over his opponents at the finish line  
if executed perfectly over 30 centimeters or 
the equivalent of one foot could be gained  
you can perform a bike through by stretching 
the back out extending the arms and legs forward  
and thrusting the bike across the line with 
force to move the bike as far forward as possible
can you talk about its mentality perhaps how he differs to other riders his particular type of character 
when he focuses on something, he's almost scary
I always wanted to be the best, 
I still want to be the best, I still believe I'm the best 
I've never looked back on what 
I've done even before i was cycling you know  
when I achieve something, I set a goal that I want 
to achieve. The day after I achieved it I
set a new goal you know that's always how it 
was and that's how it'll continued to be you know  
self-confidence is commonly defined as the 
sureness of feeling that you are equal to the task  
at hand this sureness is characterized by absolute 
belief in ability in the case of Mark Cavendish  
his confidence is reflected in everything he 
says and does it is reflected in his ability  
to bounce back from failures and it can be seen 
in his charisma and aggressive style on the bike
sprinters have to be an extroverting character 
because of the explosive nature of the side of  
the sport that they practice they have to appear 
brash they have to appear outgoing
they have to be confident they're like boxers 
you know you don't get into the ring and say yeah  
well i'm going to do my best today i'll see how it goes 
you gotta get in there and saying I'm gonna win 
I want to kill this guy I want to knock him to 
the ground and that's what a sprinter has to do a  
sprinter has to have that character otherwise he's 
gonna finish second he's gonna finish third  
and sometimes that comes out as 
being cocky and cheeky and brash but  
actually deep down Mark Cavendish 
is a pretty cool character
his career is full of ups and downs we couldn't 
count how many times he crashed or how many  
bones he's broken throughout the years his mental 
strength and immunity against fear is exceptional  
and he's never hesitant to go back 
to the danger zone and do it again
cavendish's downfall began in 2017 after he 
was diagnosed with the epstein-barr virus  
it prevented him from performing at 
the highest levels for over two years  
in that period he went through 
numerous bad experiences
nothing seemed to be going his way his inability 
to compete consistently was starting to take its  
toll on his mental health something that 
led many cyclists before him to retire  
it was downright depressing for one 
who once was cycling's undisputed sprint king
Mark Cavendish I can see it, it was a really hard hard day for you
I see you're getting emotional how how was your 
day
that's perhaps the last race in my career now
do you really think this is your last race?
maybe yeah
did you want to show something?
but there's one thing that sets successful 
people like Cavendish apart from the rest  
he is not a quitter

Ah, the Goo Lagoon... so peaceful, so serene...
Observe the fish children as they frolic and play,
and yet underneath its murky depths,
a mysterious ooze bubbles forth,
be it good or be it ill?
What is the secret hiding in the depths of the Goo Lagoon?
Only time (and this episode) will tell...
♫ Film Theory theme ♫
Hello internet!
Welcome to Film Theory!
where I'm ready, I'm ready,
I'm ready to get to the bottom of every unsolved mystery,
every unanswered question every age-old riddle from nostalgic Nickelodeon shows.
And today, we're covering these things.
Now, let me give you some backstory first,
'cause this isn't as random as it might first seem.
You see, recently I finished filming a series for Nickelodeon
that was basically Film Theory, but for classic Nicktoons.
It was like a dream come true,
getting to work with a channel that literally was my childhood.
We did episodes of "Rocket Power"s crazy skateboarding moves,
"Hey Arnold"s pigeon man,
"Avatar: The Last Airbender"s flying sky bison,
all really cool stuff.
We even did two episodes dedicated to
everyone's favorite absorbent, yellow, porous rectangle, Spongebob.
One topic we analyzed was "the Goo Lagoon,"
which, if you're not familiar,
is literally a pool of water, UNDER the water,
that all the characters treat as a local beach.
And shockingly, there is a real-life answer to that one.
Pools of water under water are totally a real-life thing.
I'm not gonna spoil how it works,
you're gonna just have to watch that episode when it finally comes out,
But, one thing that we didn't cover in that video,
that I thought would make a fascinating episode over here,
are the mysterious purple sludge blobs that come from under the surface of the lagoon.
You see, "SpongeBob SquarePants: Episode 185",
titled "It Came From Goo Lagoon",
revolved around the discovery of mysterious goo bubbles,
that floated into Bikini Bottom by way of this underwater beach area.
The bubbles provide hours of fun for SpongeBob and Patrick,
who discovered that they were bouncy and purple,
and according to Patrick:
"Ooooohhhhh- it tastes like licorice."
But for Sandy Cheeks, Bikini Bottom's resident scientific squirrel,
the bubbles were something to be wary of.
"Stop!"
"Those bubbles are dangerous!"
A potential danger that threatened the very existence of Bikini Bottom.
After a lot of floating around and exploring the many joys at the bubbles,
the episode ends with a giant goo bubble bursting over the town.
Unlike Sandy's prediction, it's not catastrophic,
but everyone does get themselves a little messy.
Mr. Krabs cashes in on the whole mess,
and all's well that ends well for our little underwater pals.
But it's weird, right?
What are these things?
The entire time you're waiting for an explanation,
and that explanation never comes.
I mean, why are they coming from the Goo Lagoon?
And why is Sandy so afraid of 'em?
It all could just be a bunch of throwaway plot threads to make the episode more exciting.
I don't think so...
It feels like there was more thought put into this thing than the episode lets on.
One thing we've talked about a lot in past SpongeBob theories,
is the fact that series creator Stephen Hillenburg was a Marine Biologist.
And so far as fantastical as a lot of this show seems,
there is a decent amount of it that's rooted in cold hard Marine Biologist fact.
Like I said, the Goo Lagoon itself has a scientific explanation.
So why not the goo bubbles that come from the Goo Lagoon?
So I decided to look a little bit closer as to what was really going on here,
and oh man, the conclusion of today's episode is gonna blow your mind.
I mean, we're not afraid to get dark here on Film Theory,
and Spongebob sometimes deals with some very serious topics,
like ocean pollution,
but this one is pretty awful.
Sandy had every right to worry.
So what's the dark secret lurking at the bottom of the lagoon?
Let's just dive into it.
Using the episode to guide us,
let's make a list of everything we know about these bubbles.
First and most obviously, these balls are made of some sort of purple goo or sludge.
You can see how thick and viscous they are just from watching the episode.
"It's so gooey!"
So we already know that we're dealing with an unusual color of goo that exists under the ocean,
but we also know that they're able to float and bounce.
Not only do we see SpongeBob and Patrick
floating above the lagoon while sitting on the bubbles,
we also see them bouncing on the surface of them.
The bubbles are also sticky.
"It sticks like glue!"
Once a bubble latches onto you,
they're pretty tough to shake off,
like in this scene with Patrick.
Speaking of Patrick, he also tells us they're stenchy.
Patrick complains that the smell of the bubbles makes his nose tingle.
"The smell makes my nose tingle."
And you know it's got to smell bad,
because this is coming from a creature who doesn't even have a nose to smell it in the first place!!!
And if Sandy's to be believed, the goo bubbles may also be dangerous
"How many times do I have to tell you that stuff's dangerous?!"
Sandy, for whatever reason, is utterly convinced
that the bubbles pose a grave danger to everyone in Bikini Bottom.
We never see any evidence of this,
considering that when the big one bursts, it only leaves harmless goo behind,
but Sandy's concerns are definitely worth making note of.
So that's a pretty decent chunk of information all crammed into a 23 minute episode.
Now put a pin in it,
(or actually don't, 'cause you'll wind up popping our little goo bubble),
hold onto that list,
because it's time to start putting some potential explanations to the test.
Theory #1: Pollution
There are plenty of long-held theories
that "Spongebob" is actually a show all about the ways the ocean is being polluted,
and it's pretty clear that there's some truth in a lot of these theories.
There are countless examples of pollution showing up on the show.
Heck, if you kept watching that diving clip from a minute or so ago,
you'll see Spongebob blocked from reaching the water's surface,
because of a layer of human pollution.
That took a turn for the worse!
In one episode, Mr. Krabs looks forward to making money off the endless summer
that global warming will cause,
by opening himself a pool.
one popular fan theory even surmises that the entire show is an allegory for global warming,
with Spongebob representing human impact as a kitchen sponge,
Patrick representing Western civilization because he's lazy and lives under a rock
(their words, not mine)
and greedy Mr. Krabs represents big capitalist corporations.
Look, I'm not saying I believe that theory,
just that it exists, and that there are people out there who do believe it.
We are equal opportunity theorists here folks.
I've come up with some pretty outlandish ones myself.
Though come to think of it,
it might be fun to do a theory review at some point, similar to meme review.
Anyway, Stephen Hillenburg in interviews would mention that pollution was a personal concern of his.
One of my favorite quotes from Stephen actually comes from an interview on that exact topic.
"My biggest nightmare is that I'm going to be at the beach one day,"
"and one of these Spongebob dolls is gonna wash up on the shore like garbage."
So could the goo of Goo Lagoon be pollution of some form,
like oil from an oil spill or something?
Maybe...
If you look at this YouTube video featuring scenes from "It Came From Goo Lagoon",
you'll see that its description reads:
"Welcome to Goo Lagoon, a relaxing retreat for the residents of Bikini Bottom."
"Despite the strange ongoings, Spongebob and Patrick have fun on the polluted bubbles!"
Now, I wouldn't put too much stock into the information contained inside the description of a video,
unless of course we're talking about the links in the top line of the description of any of our videos,
because you know that those are always gonna be important,
be they sponsorship, subscription or merch link.
But in this case, the video here was posted by Nickelodeon's official UK channel.
This is an official outlet, people!
Plus, pollution spills tend to float,
because the oil that tends to leak out is less dense than the salty ocean water that it floats on
So you got the flotation, and you got Nickelodeon UK supporting this theory,
but that's really where the evidence for the pollution theory starts to run dry.
Pollution spills, whether it's liquid asphalt in the Ohio River,
slurry oil in the Gulf of Mexico,
or diesel fuel up in Alaska,
all tend to be brown or black.
Definitely not a bright purple.
Which in my mind,
is going to be one of the most important features of the goo bubbles that we have to account for in our theory.
Plus Patrick putting the goo bubble in his mouth and being unaffected by it
doesn't exactly line up with pollution or any form of toxic waste.
Though it may have been the obvious first choice,
I have a feeling we can come up with a better theory than this one.
Theory #2 : Algae
Now when I say algae, you're probably thinking of that weird green moss that grows on top of the water,
that you've always wanted to touch as a kid,
but you never did because you were always a bit worried that it would poison you?
Was I the only one with that?
Yes, no, leave a comment down below.
Let me know if I was just the weird kid who was worried about this
either poisoning me or drowning me.
Well, I mean obviously I was the weird kid,
But I mean in this one select instance.
Anyone else relate to this?
Just me?
Let me know if I was alone!
Anyway, we're not talking about that kind of algae.
Algae comes in all kinds of shapes and colors and species.
And one of them, the Valonia Ventricosa looks a lot like the goo bubbles in "Spongebob"
Also known as bubble algae or sailor's eyeballs,
this single-celled organism is found throughout the world in tropical and subtropical ocean regions.
You heard that right, this thing is a single cell.
But not only does it have bubble in its name,
it behaves a whole heck of a lot like the goo bubbles that we see in the show,
able to float and bounce along different surfaces on the floor of the ocean,
as well as appearing to float through the water.
Bubble algae is also known for rapidly spreading.
If one bubble pops up, others are sure to follow quickly thereafter.
It's something of a notorious scourge amongst aquarium enthusiasts,
who know that if they find one in their tanks, there's gonna be a lot more to come.
The goo bubbles behave similarly.
Early in the episode, we see just one,
but mere hours later the bubbles have become an epidemic,
prompting news reports and general town panic.
So, what about that vibrant purple color?
Though Valonia Ventricosa is usually some shade of green,
the color can actually vary as widely as silver, teal, or blackish,
ultimately determined by the quantity of chloroplasts inside that one cell.
Can it be purple?
Uuugnnhh... kind of?
Maybe...?
No, not really.
And while that's already a stretch, the point of evidence that really kills this theory is the goopyness.
This algae is hard.
It looks like a smooth pearl, or ball.
It's not oozy and gloopy like the sludge balls that are coming out of the Goo Lagoon.
So again, we're back at square one.
Or should I say .... "Squarepants" one.
*crickets*
"Ooooooh, I get it!"
*cursed laughing*
But hold on all you sad Squidwards out there,
I've got an answer that matches pretty much everything that we see going on in this episode.
The secret goo underneath Goo Lagoon is none other than dead, rotting jellyfish .
Theory #3 :  Dead Jellys
My final theory for the goo bubbles is that they're not bubbles at all,
but instead creatures that naturally look a lot like bubbles instead, jellyfish.
Now, jellyfish are a huge part of "Spongebob Squarepants" the show,
with Bob and the gang constantly going out jellyfishing, and looking to nab jellyfish as pets.
Heck, they've even thrown parties in Spongebob's house,
and while most in the show are a translucent pink,
throughout the series, they've also been shown to be purple, like the king jellyfish,
and even blue.
We also know that they produce jelly,
leaving behind a goo that looks very similar to what we see coming out of the Goo Lagoon,
but I'm not here telling you that these bubbles are live jellyfish,
or the jelly that they spit out,
I am here today telling you that Spongebob and Patrick in this episode are swimming around with,
and covered in,
dead rotting corpses of jellyfish.
Get this - mysterious purple goop has been washing up on beach shores of Norway,
and it looks almost identical to the gloppy, drippy goo bubbles that we see in this episode of Spongebob.
In death, jellyfish corpses darken in color as decomposition takes place,
explaining why the real-life goop on Norway's beaches is such a deep rich shade of purple,
and why the goo bubbles in the Goo Lagoon would be darker
than the live jellyfish that we've seen previously on the show.
The bouncing and the floating of the goo bubbles?
Well that too is easily explained away by the nature of the lagoon.
Shoot!
I wanted you to have to go over to that show I did with Nickelodeon,
and watch their video to prove to Nickelodeon that I'm popular and worth working with again!
Urrgh, darn it!
But it's taking them so damn long.
True story, we filmed this thing back in July,
and the level of editing that that series requires has got to be less than what we do every week here on Film Theory.
Anyway, urggh, fine, I'll reveal the solution from that episode,
but you got to promise me at some point down the line,
when I point you in another episode of Film Theory to go over and watch that show,
and comment there how much you love MatPat,
and how eager you are to see him on Nickelodeon,
I was really planning on them having uploaded the series by this point, so I'm just gonna go for it, okay fine.
In that episode I revealed that the Goo Lagoon itself is most likely an underwater brine lake,
an area of super salty water inside the ocean.
The saltier water means it's more dense than the water around it,
which is how you get a separate pool of water underneath the water.
It's a density gradient, with the super salty water being denser than the slightly less salty water all around it.
Therefore, all dead jellyfish goo would need to be
in order to prove that it could bounce along the surface of the Goo Lagoon
is be less dense than those super salty pools,
and we already know that jellyfish are indeed less dense than the Goo Lagoon
because it's been scientifically proven that jellyfish are 95% water,
making them hardly more dense than the water that they float around in.
That, in turn, explains how the goo bubbles are able to float through the ocean water,
as well as bounce on top of the denser brine lake water.
How about the way the goo bubbles cluster?
Well, that one's easily explained as well.
Jellyfish cluster naturally.
They tend to travel in groups called blooms,
and sometimes rough winds, swells and currents send them to shore all at once.
So when they die, they tend to die together,
exactly the way they lived, explaining why the goo bubbles would show up together.
Why there would be such a massive pool of goo in this one concentrated area?
Another point in favor of dead rotting jellyfish being the cause of this whole thing: the smell.
Remember what Spongebob and Patrick said earlier?
"The smell makes my nose tingle!"
When dead jellyfish wash up on shores, they emit a terrible overpowering smell,
which explains why the characters would call them stenchy.
I mean they are dead bodies after all.
Dead bodies are not particularly known for their pleasing smell.
"But why here?"
you might be asking,
"Why are there so many dead jellyfish in this one concentrated pool?"
Well, a lot of it goes back to what Goo Lagoon is,
because it is this super salty brine lake,
it would be almost immediately deadly to any jellyfish that touched it,
which explains the dead bodies.
But there is another explanation here.
You see, large blooms of jellyfish are on the rise,
which many think is tied to increasing water temperatures because of global warming.
As a result, jellyfish are starting to pose problems for nuclear power plants,
clogging pipes that run ocean water in to cool the reactors,
and some places, like South Korea, have created jellyfish murder robots to solve this very problem.
Basically, these things are robotic search-and-destroy sea blenders
for slaughtering hundreds of jellyfish at a time.
With fishermen comparing the texture of the dead jellyfish goo to margarine.
Which, thereby makes this entire thing rooted in the type of science the creator of the show wanted in the first place.
This episode isn't a warning about pollution in our oceans.
It's instead an episode warning us about the dangers of global warming.
We're gonna have too many jellyfish, and not enough peanut butter fish!
Probably the most dad joke I've ever made.
So there you have it, friends.
We have ourselves the color,
flotation,
smell,
the fact that it's not toxic so Patrick can taste it reasonably without any negative effects,
a reason for it being there,
the stickiness,
all of it is hashed out through this one explanation.
I don't know about you,
but it looks to me like Spongebob and his pals are in fact playing with the corpses of their ocean peers.
And when those bubbles pop at the end of the episode,
everyone is covered with dead gooey bodies.
Is it gross?
Yeah!
Morbid?
Absolutely.
Great television?
You betcha!
But hey!
That's just a theory!
A Film Theory!
Aaaaand cut.

The beginning of the story
My name is Walter White
and I am meth cook.
and for 10 years, I had the best meth in Alabama.
And if you wanted the best meth,
you had to come this way, you have to come to me.
 
10 years before the Breaking Bad premiered in 2008,
Walter White of Bessemer, Alabama, was already building a meth empire
and the drug was becoming an epidemic nation wide.
The primary ingredient that
is used to make methamphetamine is
pseudoephedrine.
But in 2004, federal restrictions caused incidents of
meth to decrease significantly.
A new law regulating pseudoephedrine
products will go into effect on July 1st.
The law will require users to visit a physician
and obtain a prescription
for drugs containing pseudoephedrine.
 
From 2007 to 2011,
meth incidents rose again,
doubling nationwide due to a surge in new methods
like shake and bake,
especially in small towns
like Bessemer, Alabama,
where, when industry declined,
drug use skyrocketed.
Now, I've seen em where they would
set up in hotel rooms and
they would have these little portable labs in their vehicles, and
they have become more mobile
from what I've seen.
Two meth busts in Tuscaloosa County have
resulted in five arrests.
Sheriff Ted Sexton says
meth labs are a growing problem in Tuscaloosa County
because they are easy to hide.
 
We are in Besemer, Alabama.
Its a bit of a ghost town here.
You have broken down train stations,
you have foreclosed houses,
and this is actually where the Walter White Lives.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

In the teaser
In the teaser
for the upcoming
Pixar movie Cars 3,
We see lightning Mcqueen get flipped  the air on the racetrack.
EXSPLOSIONS PEWPEW
Sparks fly,
Smoke billows from the car,
Its not looking good for Ol' Lighting...
But there is some good news
He just saved 15% or more on his car insurance by switching to Geico.
*honk honk*
*Intro*
HELLO,  INTERNET
Welcome to Film theory
The show where crazy ideas supported by detailed research
ALWAYS GETS THE CHECKERED FLAG!
Now as many of you loyal theorists know I love me some Pixar.
Even if I do have a strange way of showing it...
and by strange way of showing it I mean ruining your childhood memories of beloved characters.
Look, I'm not the one who decided that everybody in Wall-E is a cannibal, I just pointed it out, okay?
Don't kill the messenger...and then liquefy their body and drink them as creepy future food.
But never fear those of you who wish to keep your childhood remain intact
Because today's Pixar Theory isn't gonna have some deep dark twist....Or is it?
No it isn't...probably
*suspense*
Instead today we're simply going to consider the world of Cars,
A world that looks just like our own except that there's no people and all the machines run themselves.
To catch you up, the first Cars Movie gave us the story of a young hotshot racecar named Lightning McQueen
who gets a shot at the championship, but then gives it up
because he realizes how important the other people in his uh...other cars?
In his life really are
The sequel was the next obvious place that you take that concept.
a complicated spy thriller about cars espionage an alternative fuel source conspiracy theory
because.....
WHY NOT?!?!?!?
in Cars 3, looks like it lining up to be a comeback story
we've got a trailer, which shows lightning in a catastrophic crash
and if this series keeps following the trajectory of the rocky series
the third installment would be about our heroes fight back up to the top
and hey, if we were really lucky we will get fourth one, where McQueen
races againts a russian muscle car and solves communism
sure, you laugh at that cause sounds ridiculous
but i bet you didn't expect the spy thriller plot either
long story short, the cars universe has always been a weird one
filled with a lot of questions about the logistics of the world
filled only with sentient auto mobiles
but one question none of us have ever really stopped to answer is this...
are the cars in Cars... really cars
I mean, sure it's the title of the movie
and they look and behave like cars, but who knows
that just may be more of mainstream media's fake news
I mean they have eyes and tongues
and there are no drivers then let's be honest
how does a society of living cars even come to be in the first place?
they are clearly on earth... but there are no humans
so what happened?
what... are... these... creatures?
i am a 100% confident, i figured it out
and spoiler alert (dam pun)
they are not cars
what started as a simple stupid question
let me down the rabbit hole of this bizzare car-themed universe
and the answer i found will upend everything you thought you knew
about mater and the gang
and the details i find here pose some really interesting revelations
about that infamous pixar theory
a theory that you all have wanted me to cover for quite along time
SO THEORISTS
start your search engine
because it's time to take this cars omni theory from 0 to 60 in about 15 minutes flat
now to begin, it's probably merit taking a second to acquaint you with that pixar theory
a theory that started with as far as i can tell, online movie blogger jon negroni
which aims to unite all the pixar movie to not just the same universe
but also come up with cohesive timeline of events where one movie
leads to the next, leads to the next
suck on that Marvel,
here's everyone thinking you started the whole huge connected, cinematic universe thing,
but pixar has been doing it back since 1995
in theoritical sense
so no wonder you don't have an oscar award yet
and yet academy award winning, suicide squad does
uhhh.......
now, i'm not gonna dive into nitty-gritty of that theory today
it's one that will probably be piecing together on our own,
across multiple future pixar episodes
but to get a taste of this thing and start you thinking about it
take the example of buy n large
most casual pixar viewers knows it as the corporation that runs everything in wall-e
"WORLD LEADERSHIP"
we have no one but them to thank for the cannibalistic cupcake in a cup
but, for really astute viewers you can actually see the companies rise to power
throughout multiple other pixar films
in Toy Story 3, you can see their logo on Buzz's batteries
by the time we get to UP, Buy n Large now involved in construction business
with their logo on the equipment in front of carl's house
and it's not just the equipment, BNL is also buying all the houses in carl's neighbourhood
Guy: My boss would be happy if he takes this places off your hand and uhh...
but double his last offer
what do you say to that?
*leaf blower engine*
and get this:it's even spreading to the cars franchise now
If you examine the Cars 3 extended trailer frame by frame
you see the logo appear in the stadium. Making it the first time Buy-N-Large has appeared anywhere in the Cars movie series.
*whoop* Did you spot it?
Here, let me slow it down for you.
Still no? Here, let's go frame by frame.
Welcome to my life
[in quoting voice] I live my life a quarter frame at a time.
Now the reason I wanted to start talking about this today is
because I have a few problems with the Pixar theory timeline
and the first major batch revolves around Cars.
The theory goes that a super intelligent AI,
first created by Syndrome in his quest to kill all the superheroes back in The Incredibles,
forms BNL to take control of the planet.
Along the way intelligent animals like the ones that we saw in Finding Nemo and Ratatouille
rise up against humans, a war ensues,
animals are killed off, and the AI acting through Buy N Large send humans into space,
thus kicking off WALL-E and leaving the planet alone to the AI.
The AI begin a life of freedom on their newly conquered planet
by assuming the form of sentient cars, planes, boats and cranes,
'cause seriously, think about the coolest way to get around.
That's why you don't see humans or animals in either Car Movie
and yet see the remnants of human society
like the Eiffeltower, Route 66 and things like that.
Oh maan, you got all that?
Being apart and piecing together this whole theory in detail
is gonna be like this channel's equivalent of FNAF.
Welp, no time like the present,
Carpe that Diem, let's start today.
So, this whole Pixar theory s an interesting explanation,
but there are a lot of assumptions.
Assumptions that, when you actually stop to look at the deeper evidence,
just don't work out.
And the first set of assumptions that I want to tackle today
has to do with the nature of the cars.
You see, based on the theory as it exists,
the cars would be basically smart, driverless cars
taken over by Syndrome's super advanced AI.
They would be cars, machines with computers in them,
controlled by an AI, except they're not.
The cars are actually organic creatures,
living creatures with a car body as a tough exoskeleton,
but containing some sort of internal organs,
a soft and squishy inside like the center of a tootsie roll pop.
*squeak*
You could almost equate them to the terrible monster truck movie
that no one bothered to see.
By the way, it's worth mentioning
that thing cost 125 million dollars to make
and only earned back 60 million.
Makes you almost feel bad for them.
Almost.
Anyway, back to the good car movies,
we know that the cars are living from a bunch of different evidence
sprinkled throughout the various car features.
First, they breath oxygen.
In the opening of Cars 2, we see super spy Finn McMissile put on an underwater respirator
in order to swim outside of sight of the criminal syndicate.
Later in that same movie, we see plenty of scenes
of cars eating and drinking.
On the plane to Japan we see snackfoods littered around the floor,
things like chips and sushi,
and again at the party more sushi at the bar.
And of course, the infamous pistachio icecream bit.
"How 'bout that pistachio icecream?"
A scene that tells us Mater knows
what pastachios are, what icecream is,
and has tasted it and enjoyed it.
And sure, we see them drinking varieties of oil and gas,
presumably to power their engines,
but why would they actually need to ingest food products,
if they weren't organic in some way?
Even some of the offshoot cartoons support the idea of the cars being organic creatures.
In the first Tales from Radiator Springs short
we see Lightning McQueen getting a case of a hiccups.
Hiccups are caused by irritating the diaphragm,
a dome-shaped muscle at the bottom of the chest.
When you do things like eat and drink to quickly,
it upsets the diaphragm and causes it to pull down in a jerky way.
You suck air into your throat suddenly, your vocal cords close abruptly,
and you're left with a hiccup.
All of this evidence, from the first underwater breathing
to the food to the hiccups implies that under the hood of the car,
both literally and figuratively, they posses internal organs
like lungs, stomachs, and diaphragms in addition
to their car engines.
But perhaps the biggest confirmation comes from the animators themselves.
In most interviews, the Pixar crew tends to be dismissive
about biological questions as they relate to the cars.
"I'm sorry, we have to turn off the video here."
But one featurette released on the official Disney Pixar channel
entitled Pixar Studio Stories gave us all of the confirmation that we needed.
"He can't open his doors because that's where his brains are."
They have a brain.
A giant, pink, pulsating brain,
hidden behind those car windows.
It's just...
Disturbing!
Try getting that outta your head the next time you see a Cars movie!
BRING UP THE BRAIN BLEACH PLEASE!
So it would appear that the cars are actual living creatures,
and not just some highly advanced driverless cars.
And before you complain about how stupid that all sounds,
there's an actual evolutionary chain present
throughout these films.
At about 50 minutes and 10 seconds into Cars 2
- as if watching nearly an hour of a kids movie
featuring cars in Japan, busting a fake eco-friendly fuel ring
in a massive James Bond-riff wasn't bizarre enough -
we see
birds.
Except they're not birds.
They're actually mini-planes.
Think that was just because the Pixar team was off their meds
for what seems like the entirety of this movie?
Well, think again, because in another of the Tales from Radiator Springs animated shorts
you actually get VW Beetle ... Beetles!
Tiny cars with insect wings that make up this disturbing universe's bug population.
Thus proving that the Pixar team is off their meds literally all the time.
Or on something else.
Now, this is an important detail, because it shows us
that in this universe these car-like creatures
don't just become planes when they fly like the birds,
but rather they can develop organic wings like those of a dragonfly.
And all of this is without even mentioning the fact
that there exist alien car-like species,
as we see in Maters Tall Tales, UFO edition.
Which we know is true since Mater shows that he can
fly in the end of the episode.
As one final detail, it's interesting to note
that the rubber tires aren't part of these car creatures.
In multiple parts of the series, but most notably cartoon's train scene,
we see the characters moving around with their tires removed.
They're the equivalent of shoes for the cars,
going on the feet, or in this case rims.
Suffice it to say, alien or no,
these are living creatures with internal organs
that are protected by a car-like exoskeleton,
and with multiple differentiated animal-like species
that have evolved over time from literal boats, planes, and cranes
to bug-like, and bird-like animals.
In short, when you look at all of this evidence,
there is only one possible conclusion.
That the cars in Cars aren't cars at all,
but are much more likely a highly evolved form of insect.
Sounds ridiculous, but think about it.
Just like an insect has a hard exoskeleton made of chitin,
the creatures in the car-verse have evolved a stronger exoskeleton
made of various metals.
Neither cars nor insects seem to possess an internal skeleton
and so in both creatures muscles appear
to be directly attached to the exoskeleton itself.
An insect's exoskeleton isn't a single surface,
but rather consists of multiple jointed plates,
so that when an insect moves a muscle,
it causes the connected exoskeleton plate pieces
to move as well.
It's the same style of movement that we see in the cars.
Multiple hard plates or shells moving when an internal musculatur moves as well.
But most importantly of all in the piece of evidence that solidifies this
is as we saw at the VW Beetle example
some species of the cars are able to grow wings that aren't made of metal.
Insteadd, based on the appearance and behaviour of those wings,
they're made of chitin,
just like the wings of a dragonfly.
The same substance that makes up an insect's exoskeleton.
Those chitin-based wings are a remnant from the car's evolutionary ancestors.
The cars in Cars aren't cars.
They're insects!
And that does some really interesting things for the Pixar theory.
First and foremost, it removes Cars from being attached to the era of humans,
that sort of evolution is gonna take a really long time,
so get it away from the WALL-Es, Nemos and Incredibles of the world
and put it out toward the future.
But surprisingly enough, we do happen to have a film in Pixar's line up
that does follow super intelligent bugs and their quest for survival,
bugs that already have figured out ways to master machines.
Bugs that live in a world, where there are remnants of human society,
but you see no humans present.
Yes, what I propose to you, is that Cars isn't so much it's own entity,
but rather a bugs life 2, 3, and coming up on 4.
The natural progression of insects evolving and taking over the planet earth.
And with that we have the first puzzle pieces in place
as we all start to build our own
Film Theorist-approved mega Pixar theory.
But for now, remember,
It's just a theory,
a Film Theory!
Aaaand cut!
Are you as excited as I am?
This is my first toe dipped into the Pixar theory pool
and already we're coming up with some huge revelations.
So, if you want to unravel the mysteries of the Pixar universe with me,
make sure you subscribe to the channel by slapping the film theory logo,
smack, dab, in the middle of the screen.
And hey, after you've done that,
check out my past theory on WALL-E cannibalism
or, for something lighter, just let it go
and watch this one on Frozen.
Now, if y'all excuse me,
I gotta go work on a Logan theory,
because if everything goes according to plan,
that one's happening
next week!

[Music]
did you know that there's an intense yet
quiet War fought between the British and
Russians in this battle the British
royal Navy making use of cuttingedge
technology in centuries worth of
Maritime experience overthrows the
Russian naval threats like it's nothing
these acts are way more than just
confrontational you can see them as a
game of chess with geopolitical
skills with the heating of the
geopolitical climate water surrounding
Europe have become home to an
increasingly tense atmosphere between
Britain and Russia in a rather bold and
provocative series of moves Russia has
been pushing the limits in these Waters
testing the patience of European nations
this isn't just a splash in the ocean
it's a strategic move that's drawing
attention and concern on an
international scale in response to to
the rising tension and the need to
safeguard the Integrity of European
Maritime borders Britain has taken a
decisive step the Royal Navy a venerable
force with the legacy of maintaining
Maritime order has been deployed to
monitor Russian naval activities closely
this move by Britain isn't just about
flexing Naval muscle it's a clear
message of vigilance and Readiness these
Royal Navy warships equipped with
Advanced surveillance and defense
capabilities are Britain's eyes and ears
in the these contested Waters their
presence serves as a deterrent a
reminder of Britain's commitment to
protect its interests and those of its
European neighbors as these warships
Patrol and monitor they represent a
critical component of Britain's
strategic response showcasing a blend of
restraint and Readiness That's essential
in today's times Cold War origins of
British Naval
tactics taking a long trip back to the
Cold War a cat MOS game played out
between between British and Soviet Naval
vessels this war was certainly not a
series of Random Encounters it was built
upon stealth strategy and Espionage
echoing through the icy waters of the
North Atlantic and Beyond just think of
a British Destroyer silently slicing
through the fog its crew alert eyes
scanning The Horizon suddenly a blip on
the radar a Soviet submarine lurking
like a phantom in these moments the air
was thick with tension but also with
opportunity the Royal Navy Adept in the
art of Naval Warfare wasn't just there
to show presence they were there to
learn to watch and to listen they've
since kept these tactics alive we see
them even today so naturally over the
years these British warships became
floating intelligence hubs you can
already imagine them quietly tracking
the movements of their Soviet
counterparts Gathering valuable
information they developed techniques
that were nothing short of Espionage
mastery using Sonar to Eaves drop
deciphering radio communications even
analyzing water samples to trace
submarine paths all of this was done
with a finesse that avoided direct
confrontation it was like no other Navy
every move was calculated to avoid
escalating tensions this chess game
under the waves as people like to call
it wasn't just about who had the bigger
guns it was about who had the sharper
mind the Royal Navy's approach was a
blend of in and caution balancing the
need for information with the imperative
of keeping the Cold War from turning hot
each encounter each shadowy pursuit in
the depths added a page to the annals of
Naval intelligence history a testament
to the Royal Navy skill outmaneuvering
the Russians in real time so it's clear
that the Royal Navy is no joke it's
geared up with some of the most advanced
tricks up its sleeve but how is this
Armed Force able to completely outsmart
and outmaneuver the Russians here's the
thing in the everchanging court of Naval
Warfare the Royal Navy essentially
mapping out futuristic strategies where
artificial intelligence drones and cyber
capabilities operate on the front line
This major shift set in motion by the
UK's Armed Forces specifically the Royal
Navy is not just a mere change of
equipment it is a revolutionary display
of how Naval power is used and how
adversaries like Russia are kept under
supervision let's take a moment to
picture a scenario where the Royal Navy
vessels instead of closing in on Russian
submarines observe them from a safe
distance using AI driven systems to
analyze their movements but here's the
catch this is not Science Fiction it's
the reality being crafted by the first
sealord Admiral sben Key's vision for
instance the Royal Navy's new hunter
killer submarine HMS ansen and its
acquisition of two new ships RFA Proteus
and RFA Sterling Castle marked
significant steps in this direction
these vessels aren't mere additions to
the already existing Fleet they're a
much bigger move in the game to dominate
the underwater Battlefield moreover the
incorporation of the Mark 41 missile
solo into the type 26 and type 31 frigs
represents a revolutionary development
it goes beyond mere aug M mation of the
fleet striking capabilities instead it
establishes a versatile platform capable
of deploying an array of both current
and future missiles this technological
advancement significantly broadens the
Royal Navy's operational range enabling
rapid and decisive responses to emerging
threats but it's not just about Hardware
the Royal Navy is at the Forefront of
innovation leading the way in the
utilization of unmanned systems such as
pilotless helicopters quadcopters and
jet powered Banshee drones these
cruelest Technologies provide a sneak
peek into a future where augmentation of
intelligence gathering and strike
capabilities is achieved through
unmanned systems presenting a strategic
advantage while eliminating the risk to
human lives Admiral Key's ambition is
clear to push the boundaries of what's
possible with longer range drones
capable of more than just surveillance
but also Precision strikes
as you can tell by now the Royal Navy is
heavily dedicated to Maritime dominance
and leads in integrating Advanced
Technologies as of now it has entered a
new era in Naval Warfare prioritizing
stealth and electronic warfare
capabilities to be specific the
implementation of the maritime
electronic warfare system integrated
capability or music for short goes to
show how determined the Royal Navy is in
developing the best systems for its
advantage Vantage over other Armed
Forces developed by Babcock
International in collaboration with
Elbert systems UK music is engineered to
cloak Royal Navy warships with a layer
of electronic invisibility shielding
them from the prying eyes of anti-ship
missiles it's a game of hideand-seek on
the Open Seas and the Royal Navy is
playing to win the significance of Music
cannot be overstated it represents the
cumulative efforts of months of
collaboration between the UK Ministry of
defense and Industry Partners a Synergy
of military foresight and Industrial
Innovation the system is not just a
defensive measure it's a beacon of
confidence for the Royal Navy providing
assurance that the nation is prepared to
face both current and future threats
head on by prioritizing stealth and
electronic warfare and deploying
Advanced sensor and communication
systems the Royal Navy not only secures
its Legacy but also fortifies its future
as a global Maritime power now here's a
quick question for all of you watching
do you think the British Navy is perhaps
the most strategic as compared to all
other Naval forces in the world let us
know your opinions and be sure to share
your reasons too let's discuss them in
the
comments encounters with the Russian
Navy the encounters between the Royal
Navy and the Russian Navy provide
numerous example of Britain's tactical
superiority C in late 2016 when the
Russian Admiral kusnetsov carrier
straight group returned from operations
in Syria through the English Channel HMS
St Albin was deployed on close
surveillance duties the type 23 frigate
coordinated extensively with RAF typhoon
Jets also monitoring the carrier group's
Transit through integrated sensors and
data sharing across platforms HMS St
Albin maintained realtime situational
awareness of the ship's movements and
and aircraft takeoffs and landings
however the frig's crew exercised
strategic restraint and avoided any
actions that could unnecessarily
escalate tensions while clearly
observing to fulfill its duty of
ensuring Maritime security the Royal
Navy preserved order through vigilance
rather than aggression it becomes
obvious that the Royal Navy has already
mastered their surveillance tactics and
strategies they've been far ahead of the
competition in May of 2018 the Royal
Navy displayed its continued resolve by
dispatching the hydrographic survey ship
HMS eeko on a tour of Ukraine's main
ports along the vitally important Black
Sea Coastline equipped with
sophisticated acoustic Imaging sensors
The Vessel gathered navigational data
while signaling Britain's public backing
of Ukraine's territorial Integrity in
the face of Russian naval provocations
it's unbelievable but perhaps most
vividly demonstrating British Naval
superiority has been the modernization
Endeavors to incorporate two Queen
Elizabeth class aircraft carriers
hosting f35b stealth Fighters alongside
hard power shown by their capacity to
rapidly project air power globally in
defense of UK interests the carriers
serve to deter wouldbe aggressors
through Brazen display of military
prowess on top of all this in response
to evolving asymmetric threats the UK
invested more than a whopping $3 billion
to acquire nine Boeing a Poseidon
Maritime Patrol aircraft which employ
Cutting Edge sensors to detect even
Russia's newest generation nuclear
attack and ballistic missile submarines
lurking far beneath the waves these
far-reaching surveillance platforms help
sustain Britain's advantage in
anti-submarine Warfare domain awareness
through Technologies like magnetic
anomaly detection without a shadow of a
doubt whether carrying out Shadow
operations reinforcing alliances or
leaping ahead through pioneering warship
design the Royal Navy sustains over 500
years of Mastery at Sea across
innumerable encounters with adversaries
like the Russian Federation Navy British
officers and sailors prove their
Intrepid spirit and tactical Brilliance
serve to outmaneuver even the most
veiled provocations below or above the
waves this Heritage of command ensures
that in any geopolitical contest the UK
retains dominance of the
oceans the future of the Royal Navy's
deterrent Mission so as advanced and
ahead the Royal Navy already is what
does the future hold simply put in the
profound depths the Royal Navy
submarines the silent Sentinels are
poised to become even more elusive with
Advanced sensor Suites Envision three
vessels already enshrouded in mystery
being equipped with the latest sonar
technology trans forming them into the
nation's submerged ears detecting
threats long before they manifest on the
surface the Royal Navy's warships are
preparing to embrace a new generation of
drones these aren't just ordinary drones
they serve as the fleet's Airborne eyes
extending surveillance capabilities to
unseen horizons with longer range and
endurance these drones will sail the
winds scouting ahead and relaying
crucial information back to their
seafaring commanders the roal Navy is
not solely preparing for current threats
but is actively shaping its capacity to
address the challenges that will arise
in the future this is the future of
deterrence a royal Navy that's not just
at sea but of the sea safeguarding peace
with a watchful eye and the silent
promise of
protection this does not stop here
either NATO stands shoulder-to-shoulder
with Britain forming a formidable bul
workk of a collective data defense that
ends across the waves and underlines the
power of unity it's this Spirit of
cooperation that amplifies the Royal
Navy's efforts when a Russian Fleet
Maneuvers in proximity to Nato Waters it
encounters not only British warships but
also a multinational flotilla with each
vessel equipped with its Suite of
sensors and weapons all
interconnected this collaborative effort
extends the Royal Navy surveillance
capabilities forming a complex and
robust Network the Vitality of this
Alliance lies in the training exercises
joint patrols and intelligent sharing
NATO's Naval forces spanning from the
Mediterranean to the Arctic collaborate
to maintain a state of Readiness that
serves both as a deterrent and a defense
when the Royal Navy deploys its
cuttingedge aircraft carriers they are
often accompanied by Allied vessels
creating a collective force that
surpasses the individual contribution of
its components Within in this Alliance
information circulates freely as allies
share realtime intelligence that
heightens the Royal Navy's awareness and
responsiveness it mirrors the age-old
wisdom forewarned is forearmed with
NATO's backing Britain's capacity to
monitor Russian naval activity is not
merely improved it is Multiplied
ensuring the detection of any hint of
aggression long before it can escalate
the role of allies like NATO is to Stand
United with Britain transforming the the
surveillance of Russian naval forces
from a solely British concern into a
shared commitment to the security and
stability of international waters
together they confront present
challenges and map out a course for a
secure
tomorrow as the prospect of Maritime
conflict extends into the future the
Royal Navy stands prepared armed not
only with ships and sailors but also
with a dual arsenal of technological
Supremacy and Adept diplomacy it's this
potent combination that will ensure that
the UK continues to outmatch Russian
tests of will in the years to come the
backbone of the Royal Navy's future
Readiness is its Relentless pursuit of
technological innovation with every ship
submarine and drone equipped with the
latest advancements the Navy's
capability to detect deter and defend
grows even sharper These Are Not Mere
vessels of War but bearers of a
technological Edge that slight es
through the MK of uncertainty ensuring
that British Waters and interests remain
protected importantly it's to be noted
that the Royal Navy's strength is not
measured by technology alone the hand
that wields the sword must be as deaf as
the blade is sharp right skilled
diplomacy stands as the Royal Navy's
Rudder guiding interactions on the
international stage it's this diplomatic
Acumen that forges alliances secures
peace and deters aggression the UK's
Naval diplomats do not just navigate
Waters they navigate complex webs of
relationships ensuring that tensions are
eased and conflicts are
avoided looking ahead the Royal Navy
will continue to be a silent Guardian a
watchful protector whose presence is
felt even when not seen it's a force
that speaks softly but carries the
indomitable Spirit of centuries of
Maritime dominance with a continued
commitment to Innovation and the
cultivation of strategic Partnerships
the royal Navy is poised not to just
face the challenges posed by Russian
naval forces but to maintain a position
of Advantage safeguarding the nation's
future on the Seas with an unwavering
hand so do you think the Russian Navy
has a chance against the Royal Navy
anytime soon in the future many
speculate that the Russian Navy is in
the works to outperform themselves what

on april 4th of this year my black lab
bailey had nine pups
though my channel's usually just
building stuff
i thought i'd try something new and film
the whole journey of these pups growing
up into 10 week old dogs before they're
rehomed
[Music]
[Music]
a couple days old the pups still rely on
mum for everything and that includes
eating cleaning and even just their
general sense of direction
for her it's a 24 hour a day job and for
the first couple days she even eats and
drinks right in the pen
which in our case is a kid's pool in the
garage because i'm not a dog breeder
[Music]
for the first couple weeks the pups
experienced their whole life through
just touch and smell
but soon enough their eyes will be open
and they'll be reacting to sound
[Music]
[Music]
by day five they're already a little
more self-sufficient and mom can take
longer trips away
but her bathroom breaks are still as
fast as possible
and she eats up the puppy food about as
fast as it hits the bowl
after all she's eating for 10.
[Music]
okay
[Music]
but after a couple cries from our pups
it's right back to work
[Music]
ten days in and all that eating's really
paying off they're about three times the
size of when they were born already
[Music]
the rides are still closed but they
should be open in the next couple days
and they're already starting to react to
sounds
they can also walk pretty good on their
own now
[Music]
today was also the first day i noticed
that their tails are actually starting
to wag like little dogs
[Music]
by day 15 their eyes are just starting
to crack open and mom's a lot more hands
off now
she still feeds them about six times a
day but other than that she's pretty
much free to roam around a lot
[Music]
they're starting to get pretty mobile
and pretty soon they're going to outgrow
this little kiddie pool
[Music]
they can hear every time i come into the
room now and they all start moving
around
but after a couple minutes it's time for
another nap
[Music]
at the three week mark they're
definitely starting to outgrow this
little pool so it's time to take them
inside while i build something that'll
work for another couple weeks before we
move them outside
[Music]
get them
[Music]
now they're starting to get pretty
playful and they have a little more room
to move around in their new pen
[Music]
they also like to poop a lot this pen
needs cleaned out almost every day
[Music]
they're also very aware of all their
surroundings now and pretty curious of
anything new like a camera in their home
[Music]
and for the first time they're trying
something other than milk
[Music]
and those tiny new teeth coming in sure
calls for a lot of biting
[Music]
you guard the pups
[Music]
now
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
now it wouldn't be a drew build stuff
video if drew didn't build stuff so now
i'm gonna whip up a new pen for these
dogs and they can move outside now that
the weather's a little warmer
[Music]
come on
[Music]
in week five the pups are now starting
to eat some canned wet food and a little
more pressure is taken off them all
even though we set it out for them in
three or four bowls they're always a
frenzy of one bowl while other ones
remain pretty much untouched
[Music]
though once mom's in the pen word
travels quickly that milk's still the
best option
[Music]
[Music]
by the way if you haven't already check
out my other video where i built this
teardrop camper that i can tow behind my
bike
[Music]
now the pups are getting pretty playful
and curious and they aren't a big fan of
being in their pen anymore
but lucky for them they do get out free
to roam the yard and destroy the flower
beds for about an hour three or four
times a day
and by the end the last few that were
left didn't even get put in the pen
anymore they would just stick around
home
[Music]
now mom's job is a lot more hands-off
and she can play with the pups but nine
pups is a lot for anyone to handle
[Music]
[Music]
hmm
hmm
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
mom's work here is pretty much done as
the pups are fully weaned and i've got
their first set of shots and will slowly
start trickling out one by one to their
new forever homes
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so
so
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]

john
f kennedy international airport more
commonly known as simply jfk
is one of three primary airports serving
the new york city metropolitan area
the airport handled over 60 million
passengers in 2019
making it one of the busiest airports by
passenger volume in the united
states and the busiest international air
gateway
into north america located in howard
beach queens
the facility boasts six terminals four
runways
and many more support buildings and
while you may be familiar with the
concourses gates and even views of the
runways
we wanted to know what is it like behind
the scenes
and who are the people that help keep
jfk running
in this episode we go behind the scenes
and give you an exclusive look at the
inner workings
of jfk airport this is airport uncovered
jfk
jfk international airport is comprised
of six
terminals serving more than 70 airlines
which fly to hundreds of destinations
across six continents terminals are laid
out in a loop
connected by road and rail via the air
train
at present the current terminals are one
two
four five seven and eight
you may notice there's currently no
terminal three or six
this is the product of decades of
merging and redeveloping of buildings
and no doubt is set to change again in
the coming years
as the airport continues to renovate and
expand
we start our tour at terminal one owned
and operated by a consortium of four
international carriers air france
lufthansa
japan airlines and korean airlines
terminal 1 houses 10 gates
several remote parking locations and
services
23 international carriers we spent the
day with ramp manager steve abraham
to understand what his job entails and
how this building operates
on a daily basis we would have between
40 and 50 flights a day
at the moment we're in we're probably at
18 to 20 flights per day
as traffic is continuing to increase
with
people wanting to travel again
[Music]
i am uh in charge of scheduling gating
making sure that i coordinate all the
airline schedules to ensure that we have
ramp and gate space for them i have a
staff of nine ramp controllers who work
for me who are responsible for the
movement of the airplanes both in and
out of the ramp now from the passenger
perspective this terminal has the
benefit
we thermal image all of our passengers
prior to going through security
just as an added layer of comfort for
all our passengers to know
that everybody on their plane has been
temperature stand
[Music]
trimmer one has ten gates at the moment
we're in the longer of the two departure
corridors we have seven gates down here
these are also all of our a380 gates are
in this section of the terminal
presently we're probably doing
throughput of about five to six thousand
passengers a day
which is a small percentage of what we
used to do there were days pre-coded
that we would do
25 000 twenty to twenty five thousand
passengers through here on a daily basis
we're not done with our tour at terminal
one and we'll catch up with steve again
in a little bit
but traveling airside to watch landings
and departures up close
we also got an inside look at how the
port authority does its part
in managing operations at jfk
a joint venture between new york and new
jersey the port authority was
established in 1921
but how does it fit into the complex
workings at jfk
the port authority is a major
infrastructure agency that covers
the entire region of the new york
and new jersey metropolitan area so it
covers
northern new jersey it covers new york
city
and we have multiple facilities
we operate the tunnels and
bridges that cross the hudson river we
run a commuter railroad and we operate
the three major airports in the new york
new jersey
area
on the air side the port authority is
really
being sure again in terms of vehicles in
terms of upkeep
runways have to meet certain standards
that's the responsibility of the
port authority the lights on the runways
have to meet certain standards
it's a split responsibility amongst
uh not only the terminal operators and
the port authority but the airlines
contractors who provide many of the
services but the overall
orchestration in terms of being sure
that the airport is functioning
in all respects rests with the port
authority
while port authority manages many ground
ops at jfk
terminal one oversees its own departures
and arrivals
but what exactly does that look like i
became an air traffic controller when i
was
29 years old and came to kennedy in the
early 90s and stayed
here until i turned 56 which is
mandatory retirement age for all air
traffic controllers
about 11 months after i retired the
folks at terminal 1
thought that i could help manage their
ramp given that i had such a good
understanding of how air traffic flows
around this airport since i spent more
than 20 years here moving the airplanes
around the airport
so this is the ramp control tower here
at terminal one while operation center
is one floor below
our ramp controllers work from up here
along with our ground service provider
coordinator
we only have one ground handling company
for all our airlines
so from the airlines perspective if the
station manager has an issue with
baggage if the station manager has an
issue with cabin cleaning
with catering with security will always
come through us
and we're the conduit to the ground
service provider it's
part of our model here at terminal one
the terminal manager on duty has
multiple screens in front of him at the
moment he's looking at the baggage belt
system
the intakes the laterals where the bags
where passenger drops off a bag
it gets fed through our baggage system
and then it gets sent out to laterals
down below
where our ground handler will pack the
bags
into the ulds before they're loaded onto
the airplane
and the baggage system actually scans
the tags
that you see placed on your bag and will
know which lateral to send the bags to
so all
the saudi bags will end up on one
lateral and all the turkish bags will
end up on another
and then they're packed loaded into the
containers and stuck on the bottom of
the air
stuffed into the bottom of the airplane
this is our gate plotting software
it is initially fed in with estimated or
scheduled time of arrival and schedule
time and departure it automatically
updates based on movements from the
airplane
so we will have a good picture
of what gate all the airplanes are going
to what time they're supposed to push
when the next arrival is supposed to go
into that gate
so we always maintain a level of
situational awareness up here
because you don't want to push an
airplane back when there's an arrival
just about to come in
because it's obviously you don't want to
cause your own ram congestion
while the tower at terminal 1 works to
minimize delays and missed connections
for its human passengers
there's another terminal at jfk that
specifically caters to passengers of
another variety
we took a short drive to meet the staff
and answer the question
what is the ark welcome to the arc at
jfk
this is jfk's animal reception
terminal hi i'm beth
shooty i'm the managing director of the
ark at jfk
the argud jfk opened on january 2nd 2017
and we comprise 50 employees
jfk is one of three major ports of entry
for the united states the other two are
in
miami and los angeles so that means that
all of the different federal agencies
that regulate
animals are present here at the airport
24 hours a day just as we are to service
any kind of needs with
clearing animals or exporting animals
if we hurry up we might get a horse
good how you doing
so these horses today will be departing
on a flight
to liege and belgium and from there
they could be dispersed all throughout
europe some of them go for competition
some go for breeding
you think about getting on a plane
yourself you know you have to have your
identification and you have to make sure
that you have your luggage and your
security screening
when you're moving an animal it doesn't
typically
move with you unfortunately animals if
they're
being shipped as cargo go in a separate
area of the airplane they have to be
delivered to a completely separate area
of the airport
they have to be screened just as a
passenger would be screened
so when you're dealing with a live
animal you really have to think about
the feeding of that animal the relief of
that animal the um
you know the stress that animals are
placed under
so this is our aviary and
in transit area so they're coming off of
one
flight and going on another and they get
held here
to be inspected by fish and wildlife
cdc if necessary and us department of
agriculture
so counting the number of animals coming
through here is is
a challenge mostly because we go from
very small animals like think fish or
chicks to
very large animals such as horses horses
are much more easy to quantify
this year we expect approximately 4 000
horses to come through this facility
so the jet stalls are over here and
those are where three horses
are loaded into each stall they would be
placed a death stall
replaced on this loader here and after
it's loaded
it gets placed onto our trailers
which are over here for small
animals we estimated somewhere around 10
000 animals per
year and that ranges in size
like i said from small fish to larger
dogs
and more exotic animals
back on the people side of the airport
jfk's passenger terminals are all
connected via the airport's 8.1 mile
long
elevated rail system the air train
the fully automated driverless system
runs 24 7
and consists of three lines that service
10 stations
with connections to the nyc transit
system
while a rail link to the airport was
recommended as early as the late 1960s
the project did not come to fruition
until much later
with construction beginning in 1998
the system opened on december 17 2003
and as of 2019 total ridership was 20.9
million
while the airtrain can take you to any
of jfk's terminals
if you have extra time terminal 5 boasts
a particularly noteworthy attraction
that has
thankfully for us stood the test of time
so the twa hotel is a six and a half
acre mixed use facility
that's physically located at the center
of jfk airport
it's a ground up rehabilitation of
aeroserene's iconic 1962 twa flight
center
the building opened may 28 1962
and operated as an airline terminal up
until
american airlines bought twa in 2001.
they found that they could not use the
building and they handed the keys back
to the port authority of new york new
jersey
and since 2001 the building sat derelict
[Music]
when we started developing the building
very very difficult adaptive reuse
you're in the middle of you're in the
middle of a live airport
it's a landmark interior and exterior
and it's a wildly important building
[Music]
from an architectural standpoint it was
designed and
and built by probably the first
starchitect uh aerosarenin
howard hughes designed the twa terminal
uh to support the lockheed constellation
l-1649 which happens to be a propeller
plane um
the jet age came of age at idlewild
airport in the 1960s
and that brought along jet planes flew
twice as fast
seated twice as many people twice as big
the building was functionally obsolete
the day it opened on may 28 1962.
when you walk into the building itself
you'll notice a few things
one there's no columns and that's
because
structurally it's a marble it's a 66 000
square foot
concrete shell poured concrete that's
held up by four points of contact with
the ground
you just would never get that today
another
kind of really unique thing about the
building there is not a straight line in
this building everything isn't
completely curved
third you'll notice that there is penny
tile everywhere and it's this
beautifully articulated
penny tile the grout was labored over
it's a
modern marble from a visual standpoint
it's this white concrete palace
that you're walking into so i think from
an aesthetic standpoint it just can't be
matched this building is so important
to a lot of different people
[Music]
as the day winds down clouds gather
overhead and a sudden weather cell
envelops the airport
back in the air traffic control tower at
terminal 1
ramp manager steve checks on his staff
mr adams says as a 1622 all ramp
activity has been suspended
you know when we get thunderstorms with
lightning proximity to the airport we
have to close the ramp take all our
personnel
off the ramp all the ground staff off
the ramp it'll obviously lead to delays
in both loading and unloading and it's
usually a cascading effect because once
you get weather like this airplanes one
flight won't fly the approach
so your concern is departures who don't
leave impacting arrivals that won't have
gates but
usually the arrivals are going into a
hold
[Music]
brian is there flat spinning or still
coming in
in the back side of it is
[Music]
the back side of it is probably over
laguardia i mean this will be over in 10
minutes
and then just rain
you know there are times when we get
lines of thunderstorms that stretch from
montreal to atlanta there's no way
around them
this is a short confined cell so if
you're actually you know 70 miles north
of new york you can get to the back side
of the cell and still get here
at the beginning of the pandemic our
airports
were down more than 95 in terms of their
pre-covered
levels as of last week they had
recovered to about 50 percent
of pre-covert levels but we have kept
the airports open during the entire
pandemic
and so we're looking forward to a really
strong return
in the course of the rest of this year
as we
transition out of coven we're doing
everything possible to ensure a safe
experience for the passenger
but ensuring that the passenger has
the opportunity to experience what they
did experience before
jfk is a sprawling complex and we've
only touched the surface here today
have you been to the airport before if
so what else would you like to know
about how it operates

ideas for more original content you'd

hello everyone and welcome back to the
fluctus channel
the president of the United States is
considered by many to be among the most
important public figures in the world
[Music]
for this reason the president's advisors
cannot simply let their leader travel
from place to place via commercial means
[Music]
in the early 20th century the U.S
introduced the first presidential
motorcade
A procession of vehicles typically
accompanied by law enforcement and other
security personnel
the first to benefit was William Howard
Taft but since then every U.S president
and many other leaders have enjoyed the
protection of this defensive approach to
travel
foreign
motorcade serves a number of purposes
[Music]
for starters it is symbolic of the
president's importance and Power
[Music]
even before the invention of the
automobile
politicians and celebrities often
participated in parades and processions
designed to invoke a sense of authority
in the attending audience
ladies and gentlemen since the JFK
assassination which took place in a
motorcade the primary function of the
process is to protect the president from
potential threats
for this reason modern motorcades
typically include a lead vehicle several
support vehicles and a heavily armored
limousine for transporting the president
[Music]
have been constructed with various
Advanced security features including
bulletproof glass armor plating and
anti-bomb countermeasures
last but not least the motorcade serves
the Practical purpose of moving the
president from point A to point B
quickly and efficiently
because a local law enforcement is
typically involved processions can
usually bypass red lights in high
traffic areas to cut down on
Transportation time
the Secret Service is the organization
most directly responsible for protecting
the U.S president vice presidents and
other high-ranking government officials
[Music]
though they are essentially a federal
law enforcement agency they are
responsible for traveling with the
president to ensure his or her Safety
and Security at all times
an advanced team of Secret Service
agents will also arrive at Major
destinations ahead of the president so
that they can have everything ready and
waiting
and he might Rock back
this includes unloading all the
necessary Vehicles weaponry and other
equipment for the upcoming operation
every city street and event presents a
unique challenge for the Secret Service
team and its presidential motorcade
in order to ensure smooth Safe
Transportation for the president and
their team the Secret Service will
dedicate extensive resources and time to
the preparation process
[Music]
this includes route planning which means
evaluating any and all traffic patterns
road conditions security risks and
potential protests or demonstrations
[Music]
the advanced team will also coordinate
with local law enforcement government
officials and transportation authorities
to identify and mitigate any potential
problems
the motorcade is generally comprised of
lead Vehicles the presidential limousine
supporting vehicles and motorcycle units
the lead vehicles are responsible for
clearing the way and ensuring the route
is safe
the support vehicles and motorcycles
carry additional security medical
support and Personnel who can quickly
adapt to potential problems or threats
many presidential events involve more
than just moving the president from one
location to another
[Music]
in many cases the motorcade will be part
of an enormous parade with thousands of
people in attendance bands and other
presentations going on
foreign
to properly prepare for such an occasion
the Secret Service will spend
significant time Gathering regarding any
potential threats on a local or national
level
[Music]
it will also assess the route and
coordinate with other law enforcement
officials to establish backup plans that
can be executed in the event of an
emergency
operations
the Secret Service will also conduct
training exercises and rehearsals to
familiarize personnel with their roles
and responsibilities during the parade
[Music]
this includes pricing motorcade
formations emergency response drills and

contrary to popular belief the name Air
Force One does not always refer to a
specific plane

traffic control call sign for any United
States fixed Wing aircraft carrying the
president
[Music]
the history of this call sign goes all
the way back to the 1930s but did not
come to include any specialized aircraft
until 1943.
[Music]
that's when President Franklin D
Roosevelt began flying on a modified
Douglas c-54 Sky Master known as the
sacred cow
[Music]
this aircraft was the first to be
specifically built and equipped for
presidential use featuring an enclosed
sleeping area a radio telephone and
other amenities
[Music]
thank you by the 1990s Air Force One was
a heavily modified Boeing 747 capable of
long-distance flights and possessing a
variety of security countermeasures and
Communications equipment
[Music]
this model known as the vc25a boasts a
Max takeoff weight of 833 thousand
pounds can carry 76 passengers and
contains a number of meeting and
briefing rooms from which the president
can conduct business
one of the most iconic Air Force One
models in history was a modified
vc-137c Stratoliner designated Sam
26000.
though it was the primary presidential
aircraft for several U.S presidents it
is most commonly associated with John F
Kennedy
foreign
[Music]
-26000 was delivered to the U.S Air
Force in 1962 and became the first
jet-powered aircraft specifically built
for presidential use
it featured a distinctive blue and white
design that remains a fixture in Air
Force One models to this day
after Kennedy's assassination the plane
passed on to Lyndon B Johnson who took
it to Southeast Asia on multiple
occasions
[Music]
1998 after 36 years of service Sam 26000
was retired
the aircraft was then moved to the
national museum of the United States Air
Force in Dayton Ohio where it remains on
display
whenever Air Force One lands on
Sovereign or foreign soil the Secret
Service and local law enforcement will
Implement a highly detailed set of
processes
foreign
though Air Force One sometimes receives
a military escort it's more common that
planes will be standing by in the event
of an emergency
[Music]
in many cases the airport will set aside
a block of time so that Air Force One is
the only plane landing and Taxi
providing adequate room for the Secret
Service to Usher the president and their
Entourage into the waiting vehicles
the entire process involves strict
security measures and confidentiality so
that bad actors have little to no chance
of interfering with the president's trip

States generally does its best to
transport foreign dignitaries and other
VIPs in both safety and style
[Music]
for this reason the government has
invested in a series of Gulf Stream c-37
aircraft they can use to Ferry Personnel
around the country
the typical c37 is a business class
private jet
they are roughly 96 feet long and can
carry between 15 and 19 passengers
[Music]
since both Air Force One and the
government c37s are specifically
intended to carry VIPs and their staff
the United States goes to Great Lengths
to provide these individuals with a wide
range of comforts
foreign
this includes highly trained in-flight
culinary Specialists who essentially
function as Airborne executive chefs
[Music]
and while safe transport from place to
place is always priority number one the
United States military isn't afraid to
ensure their VIPs travel in style

that's the end of this video
I hope you enjoyed it make sure to
subscribe to this channel so you don't
miss any of our new content
see you next time

going to give you a full crash course on
how to make your first short film even
if the only thing you've ever shot
before is funny videos of your cat
i'm going to do it in only 5. so we
better get started fast a little bit
about me been making films since i was
11. i've probably made like 50 short
films for a while i was doing one every
month on my youtube channel i've made a
couple of no budget features about a
couple of things go viral so i
definitely know how to get my hands
dirty get a film made and help you make
yours so let's begin
writing this may sound a little
counter-intuitive but rather than
originality when you're writing your
short film i want you to focus on
entertaining yourself or a really close
friend of yours
make your audience really specific so
that you can make your film more
specific if you try to be
everything to everyone you're gonna end
up with something that's really boring
and flat and probably really cliched
maybe you already have an idea for your
short film but if you don't try to
reverse engineer your story idea based
on things that you already have access
to let's say your uncle has a barn maybe
you can do a cool horror film out there
maybe you have a friend or a family
member that has a really big personality
that would be great in a movie and you
convince them to be in it very important
point make your film
simple and small you want this thing to
be five minutes or less
do not make your film longer than five
minutes if you've never made a movie
it's probably not going to be good
enough to justify being longer than five
minutes also every aspect
of making this movie is gonna be so much
easier when you keep the runtime low as
a beginner the smaller the scale of your
film the better it's gonna end up being
think about it would you feel more
comfortable making a short film about
storming omaha beach on d-day or
a short film about a guy who
accidentally super glues himself to his
own toilet seat one of them is going to
be a lot easier to pull off that's all
i'm saying go ahead and write out the
beginning
the middle and the end just a few simple
sentences it'll basically just be your
whole story in a paragraph and if it's
not an interesting paragraph then you
might want to go back to the drawing
board here's an example for a short film
that i wrote and never ended up actually
making a little girl is crying because
her dad isn't home on her birthday her
mom plays a vhs tape that he made him
apologizing and wishing her the best
birthday he has a bad cough in the video
but he's goofy and heartwarming and by
the end of the tape the girl is happy
again the mom
puts the tape away but she starts crying
herself we then see that the stack of
tapes is other birthday tapes labeled up
to age 18
and realized that the dad has actually
already died and he made these tapes in
advance for his daughter
so you got a beginning that's setting up
things you got a middle that's
obstacles and the journey towards the
ending and that ending is going to be
something that's a little surprising but
definitely satisfying and definitely
makes me feel good about having just
watched the other four minutes of your
short film so now you got this paragraph
time to write it out just expand it
don't worry about proper script format
yet just write out what happens
where it happens and who says what in a
format that makes sense to you if you do
want to learn proper script format it'll
probably only add an extra hour to your
life and then you can go the link in the
description for some free screenwriting
websites and use that to make your
script
take that written out story and you're
gonna read it through in your head
visualizing it as you do
try to do it in real time as much as
possible as if you were watching the
final film you're gonna run a stop watch
while you do that and make sure that you
end up around four minutes i say four
not
five because inevitably the final film
is gonna end up being longer than what
you picture in your head if possible
take the story and get some feedback
from some friends some people that you
trust
collaboration is so key with film two or
three or four heads is always going to
be better than one
and you're going to have a lot of blind
spots especially when you're first
starting out as to what you think is
interesting or how a certain thing is
going to read to another person
versus how it actually comes off
congratulations you're out of writing
and you're into pre-production you're
going to go to the calendar you're going
to find a day that makes sense and
you're going to mark that day that's
going to be your shooting day from now
on when you tell people you're making
your movie you're saying i'm shooting it
on this day
go find the bare minimum number of
people that you can to actually make
this movie and you're going to tell them
hey we're shooting on this day
can you do it it's going to be really
fun i'm going to give you some free food
bare minimum number of people on the set
you don't want other people just hanging
around it's going to distract you you
need to stay focused on the film get
your props your wardrobe any other
special things that you need to actually
make your movie you're going to take
your script print it out
start making handwritten notes all over
it about how you envision the scene how
the actors might perform it what the
pacing is going to be like what the
energy of the scene is going to be like
specific
shots that you're thinking of anything
that comes to mind just mark that script
up if you know how to draw that's great
i highly recommend making storyboards
they don't have to be fancy or cool just
use stick figures if you can't even do
stick figures then just do little shot
descriptions but it's important to be
organized and prepared for your shoot
day especially when you're starting out
now take all the shots figure out what
the most logical order to shoot them in
is if it's possible definitely try to
shoot them in order chronologically
according to the script but if that's
not possible a lot of people like to
shoot the wider shots first and then
shoot all the shots pointing in one
direction and then shoot all the shots
pointing in another direction that way
any lighting changes or whatever your
shots just stay more consistent write it
all down
that's going to be your instructions for
the day so no matter what comes at you
on shooting day i can follow my
instructions and i will get to the end
of this film now let's get down to
actual production
if you have a camera great use it if you
don't use your phone if you have a
camera but you're not really comfortable
with it
use your phone the point is don't focus
too much on cinematography for your
first short film no matter how much
attention and time you spend on it it's
not going to be the revenant and it's
not going to be what keeps people tuned
into your film it's going to be the
storytelling so focus on that
more important than that cinematography
you need to be worried about the audio
bad audio is going to hurt your film so
much more than bad cinematography for
example how long would you watch this
video if it all sounded like this
get a friend to help out with a
microphone off screen don't have a
microphone these are great and just be
strategic
about it and be creative if you're
getting a close-up like let's say i
punched in like this your actors are
holding their phones like this you're
going to get really nice audio if the
shot's too wide for your actor to hold
the phone then just
hide it in the scene i'm going to get
great audio but you're not going to see
it if none of those are options then
what you're going to want to do is do
the take
and then go back maybe immediately after
you did the take
and record wild audio which is audio
that's recorded after the actual shot to
try to match what you just recorded so
play back the video so your actor can
try to match exactly the way that they
set the line and get your phone or mic
right up on them so you get some really
clean audio and then you can match it up
in editing and then you can match it up
in editing and then you can match it up
in editing do the same thing for sound
effects remember movie sound effects are
just a lot larger than life now follow
your instructions go through each shot
make sure that you have all the puzzle
pieces you need to assemble this
together later in editing finish that
shoot day be very gracious to all the
people that helped you out give them
some food take your footage take your
audio dump it on the computer make
two copies put it on a hard drive put it
somewhere else there's nothing more
depressing
than losing an entire day's footage or
audio congratulations that was probably
the hardest part you're already moving
on to post production now if you don't
know how to edit that's okay you spend
about an
hour on youtube watching tutorials you
can get up to speed enough to start
cutting your film just get the basics
down how do you bring the clips in how
do you cut them and you'll figure it out
as you go
i recommend imovie if you're on a mac
it's free it's really
intuitive and easy to learn if you don't
have a mac i'd recommend davinci resolve
it's free it's a little more complicated
but it's a very powerful program
number one principle you'll need to
abide by is to cut out
any dead moments
it's not entertaining or engaging to the
viewer get rid of it throw in those
sound effects that you recorded on the
day or if you don't have enough go to
freesound.org there are links in the
description you can get a bunch of free
sound effects for your project or you
can go make your own now you can use
music from the youtube audio library
i'll link to it my description it's all
free tracks that you can use to score
your film or if you want to have fun and
you don't care about copyright just
throw a bruce springsteen track in there
and have a ball focus on that audio try
to clean it up do a little cross
dissolves between cuts and the audio
just to get rid of any distracting
changes in background noise now finish
that rough cut
get to a point where you feel like it's
pretty good and then show a couple of
friends that you trust
watch them watch your film see where
they're engaged see where they're bored
and then get their feedback after see if
they have any opinions about how you can
improve it or things you could cut out
or things that weren't clear didn't make
sense don't take any of this stuff
personally this is all
really valuable information it's going
to make your film so much better take
that information adjust your edit
accordingly if you need to do it and
you're able to do it go out and do
reshoots go back and pick up shots that
are going to clarify your story or make
something more emotional or just work
better be prepared to kill some darlings
some of your favorite parts of the film
might just be the most indulgent parts
of the movie and would actually be
better left on the cutting room floor
keep your movie short and sweet and
leave people wanting a little bit more
you kept it under five minutes right
now export your movie put it on youtube
send a link to everybody that helped you
along with your sincere thanks
pat yourself on the back congratulations
you made your first short film now look
objectively at this first short film
there's going to be a lot of problems
with it analyze it figure out what your
real weaknesses were on the project and
then do a bunch of research go to
youtube i'm going to be uploading videos
every week that'll help you i hope but
there's also
tons of other creators out there that'll
have all kinds of advice for your
specific weaknesses i know it can be
scary and overwhelming to go out and
make your first film even if you've been
thinking about it for a long time i
guarantee you that the feeling of
satisfaction that you're going to get is
going to make it all worthwhile
i'm kent lane from standard story
company tune in next week for more
unsolicited filmmaking advice i'll go
make a short film

east hastings is widely regarded as the
most dangerous street in north america
well besides mexico obviously
it is a hot spot for homelessness drug
use and crime it's awesome conditions
have become so unsafe on hastings in the
downtown east side it has suspended mail
delivery here is a look at some dramatic
footage from within the last hour
[Music]
located in the heart of downtown
vancouver hastings has a reputation for
being the worst street in canada the
corporation said the neighborhood was
now so dangerous employees would no
longer be delivering letters or parcels
to residents or businesses people avoid
it like the plague and it is one of
those things nobody likes to talk about
however due to the controversy it peaks
everybody's curiosity have you ever been
to hastings let's go drive down the
middle of the street these are regular
conversations you will hear amongst
people who visit some would even argue
it's a tourist attraction in a really
dark [ __ ] up way
i was recently staying in an apartment
in gastown vancouver
literally two minutes away from hastings
i used to do lots of wild interviews at
weird locations on this channel and i
thought wow hastings that fits right
into this category but instead of doing
interviews during the daytime like a
[ __ ] i decided to go at nighttime the
most sketch time possible saturday night
days after a value village was burned to
the ground we begin with breaking news
or a large fire has broken out at the
value village thrift store near east
hasting street was it arson
i'm not saying it was arson but it was
definitely arson vancouver fire and
rescue telling city news that most of
the building has already collapsed but i
didn't focus much on that i focused more
about the stories of the people who were
actually living on hastings
foreign
oh
walking into this place felt like a bad
drug trip street lights were blinking
there were weird noises sirens and
everybody was staring at me which i
don't blame them i'm a great looking guy
within 15 minutes of being there we had
already received multiple death threats
dudes on bikes would come out to us in
the background and tell us that we were
going to get jumped and that we can't
point our cameras a certain way you know
yadda yadda same [ __ ] i've heard a
million times we kept filming what are
they gonna do stop me in the middle of
the street i mean probably statistically
yeah that's what happens at hastings
[Music]
i found this one guy that went on one of
if not the most epic rants of all time
he pretty much took every conspiracy
i've ever heard and linked them together
in one coherent plot it was so insane i
had to break it into multiple sections
throughout the video so make sure you
watch till the end of this video for the
grand finale once he puts all the pieces
together it blew my mind
there was an ambulance cop car or fire
truck blaring sirens every five minutes
or so and according to him they only
come by when he is telling the truth to
silence his words
but anyways
[Music]
[Music]
two
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
so
some of these guys i genuinely felt bad
for they seemed very nice and for lack
of better words normal
the drug use had definitely done some
damage on them but besides that they may
as well been sitting on a muskoka chair
at the cottage enjoying a nice crispy
brew except their cottage was on
hastings
[ __ ]
one of the misconceptions people have
about homeless is one they are
disgusting leopards but two that they
are all intense and serious i disagree i
think they are more like us than the
normies online think because the normies
online don't actually go and talk to
them i do just because they are homeless
doesn't mean they don't have a sense of
humor
[Music]
so
throughout that entire ordeal this guy
didn't blink once holy [ __ ] he basically
unlocks
so after about an hour filming we were
struggling to get any interviews people
were abrasive and aggressive and we were
getting eyed up by many sketchy looking
dudes who walked around us with their
hands in their pockets seeing how we
reacted to being followed and watched
our camera gear looked like a nice tasty
pork chop
or rather something that could be traded
for drugs so let's talk about drugs
hastings is a central hub for drug use
it is the most concentrated area of high
people i've ever seen in my life and
i've been to a lot of raves when i mean
high i mean it looked like a walking
dead people literally hunched over in
comas like they were visiting god now
this is something that terrifies most
people which is why everybody avoids the
area like their step parents and i don't
blame them one of the creepier things is
that the drugs are so affordable that's
what sustains this activity fentanyl
which is way more cheaper way more
accessible and has significantly higher
profit margins and it's coming straight
from china through the ports so it's
[ __ ] everywhere on top of that
vancouver recently decriminalized drugs
under 2.5 that's right baby party time
methamphetamines coke molly all the good
stuff you will no longer be arrested or
charged so on one hand people think wow
that's great people no longer have to go
to jail for possessing small amounts but
then somebody explained it to me
differently because they decriminalized
up to 2.5 grams of these drugs drug
dealers can easily dominate the street
one of them drives around and drops off
2.5 g's to multiple smurfs at once who
then easily spread out and deal to
everybody throughout the street and hey
as long as they only have 2.5 for
personal use it's like the drug dealer
cheat code so it's only been a few weeks
since this happened so we'll have to see
how it plays out in theory it's a good
idea but like i said it's way easier to
profit and distribute drugs on hastings
and in vancouver from now on so it's
definitely helping some of the
entrepreneurs stimulate the hastings
economy
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
there were definitely some characters
there for sure but like i said a lot of
people there they had a sense of humor
they want to be talked to as a normal
person
if anybody deserves a book deal it's him
shout out to this legend now like i
mentioned earlier we constantly had
people following us around warning us of
violence if we did the wrong thing or
film someone or whatever some people
said it respectfully others were being
very passive-aggressive they almost had
this sense of entitlement like they
owned the street and you were not
allowed to look at them or even film
them or their tents in the background
walk in their area et cetera et cetera
and on one hand i was very saddened by
the state of some people on these
streets but here's another angle just
because you set up a tent and took a
[ __ ] next to it does not mean you own
the sidewalk
[Music]
eventually we made our way off the
street and to be honest it was because
it was just too [ __ ] depressing we
walked in and the energy changed it was
like a force field of darkness around
the edges we were walking into a storm
my buddy turned to me and he was like
dude
why am i so [ __ ] depressed we need to
get out of here and go see somebody with
a smile on their face so after an hour
or two of some of the most intense
interviews we've ever done we headed out
of the matrix and back in the
civilization a staggering 50 meters away
that's what's so weird about it it is
right next to everybody and everything
else so today is thursday and last night
i finished recording and then out of
nowhere i was notified that there was
another fire at hastings this is a live
view of the area surrounding maine and
east hastings where a fire has broken
out literally a church
set on fire and burned yesterday we
walked over i even shot some video of it
myself i don't even know what to say at
this point guys turns out there's been
an arson burning a bunch of [ __ ] down in
hastings and now this fire it's crazy
they are trying to burn this place to
the ground it is the most deadly street
in north america it was burning
yesterday that's crazy guys sounds like
i'm gonna have to go back to hastings at
some point and do a round two of this
video what do you guys think is going on
here why is everything burning down drop
a comment below most of the building has
already collapsed
hope that you enjoyed the video i
haven't done interviews or documentaries
in ages but that is actually the og
content of this channel i recently got
the itch to start doing it again and i'm
going to be filming these the rest of
the summer i'll be hitting calgary
stampede shambhala psychedelic festival
veld and much more making mini movies
like this the reason i stopped filming
these is because they got demonetized
age restricted and even when they do
escape the wrath of youtube the cpm is
depressingly low when you take into
consideration traveling editing etc i
actually lose money when i make videos
like this so perhaps i will start a
patreon or something like that i'm not
sure yet i want to hear from you in the
comments if you enjoyed this let me know
i know a lot of you only watch for the
interviews and felt betrayed when i
switched to pranks a couple years ago so
if you're still here leave me a comment
follow me on instagram send me a message
and tell me what you thought of this
video and if you would sign up for a
patreon to watch content like this let
me know in the comments and i will
consider it
[Music]
[Music]
you

she was married I don't know what
happened to her marriage maybe she was
divorced or whatever I don't know she
was married so she was a
woman and immediately she came in she
knelt down I am telling you this because
I'm a
witness please sir I am homeless I don't
have a place to stay fire engulfed our
[Music]
house prophet Joshua's wife has come out
to speak concerning the allegation
leveled against her husband by bisola
and she also narrated how bisola come
about like how bisa became part of the
family you know bisa also narrated so
many things against this prophet and his
wife has surfaced to say so many things
she further explained why bisola is
doing her best to make sure she T the
image of the Prophet you and I know that
bisa claimed that the late man of God
ried our when she was a member of his
church she also alleged that the clergy
man ran a kind of sex ring where he
slept with young virgins anytime he
wanted bisa Johnson worked for the
preacher and stayed with him for good 14
years because I'm a
witness years back in this
ministry this structure was not
here I said it again the prophet office
was just down
there it was a Wednesday service
and after the service people will come
in to see
him there's a way that office was
built for instance you are coming
through this way this is the entrance to
the
office you come in this is the office
but in this office there's two rooms
Here
There and there's something like this
before you get to the
room so this this is the prophet's
office you will walk in this way me
being me I hang
here and I'm watching as people comes
in and a woman I called her a woman
because before she came to the synagogue
she was married I don't know what
happened to her marri marriage maybe she
was divorced or whatever I don't know
she was married so she was a
woman
and immediately she came in she knelt
down I am telling you this because I'm a
witness please sir I am homeless I don't
have a place to stay fire engulfed our
house and the prophet was like this in
fact I can tell you the cloth he wore
that day you know those ghanian cloth
that have
stripes that was the cloth he wore that
day and he was listening to this lady I
was there watching after listening to
her said okay go and wait for me outside
she she went
[Music]
back and the shter was given to her in
this
ministry when she came in she want to
make me a friend I said no this one
cannot be my
friend over the years she tried to make
me a friend I said you cannot be my
friend because she doesn't know anything
about me today she can't say anything
about me because she doesn't know me
and
so we begin to live in the synagogue I
saw
how and I thank God that the prophet did
not give it to our
foolishness keep away from foolish
people stay away from them so that you
don't become what they
are when her time came to leave the
synagogue she
started
the prophet is this the prophet is that
that and this he has no wife he has no
child I said all those times I used to
come to my tiny sitting room to come and
tell me this one happened h m said you
don't know what is happening this one
happened I said I don't look at those
things though in fact I don't see
them who was
I who was right to you then
but you know what with all she has said
in this word about Prophet expecting her
to say one
thing why did the prophet spot at you
publicly in this
church spart at your face publicly you
had a pro a pastor talking touch me here
touch me there this is a woman that
would say come and touch my breast she
has
boy oh there's camp come and pray for me
stay away from foolish
people stay away from them so that you
don't become what they are who they
are right now we don't know who to
believe the more people surface the more
the issue get complicated I really don't
understand the way these things is going
right now because so many Nigerians
really do not know what to say
concerning this meanwhile some have
already taking side so who to believe
now should we believe bisa or we should
believe what TB Joshua's wife said but
the way bisa was seing in that video
like unveiling so many deep Secrets it
was as if she she she has grudges for
Prophet TI Joshua and I think she sees
this as an opportunity for her to take a
Revenge maybe because of what might have
happened long ago that you and I don't
know T Joshua asked me to find virgins
for him to bring young girls into
disciple
[Applause]
[Music]
fold in the midnight this person will be
called into his bedroom so that he could
disend
them when those girls come out he
usually take all the bed sheet and
everything he packed them and take them
to the prayer Mountain this lady claimed
to be a raped victim and she called
herself Tibi Joshua's daughter which
everybody is already you know saying all
around social media everywhere carrying
the rumors carrying the news that a is
Prophet TI Joshua's daughter and people
are now believing that all she has said
concerning the prophet because they said
since now the prophet begin so anything
the P can't talk now truth and this has
made a lot of Nigerians believed her so
much without even investigating anything
but this man here has come out to say so

offer my insights to the body of Christ
given that I was a disciple of prophet
TB Joshua alongside my wife for many
years
is I must first clarify that my
spiritual journey and the establishment
of Faith open love ministries of Frank

mother figure to me I hold her her
family and all my brothers and sisters
from the scone in high
esteem I want to
stress that the accusations made in the

accusers I pray and encourage
all to seek the spirit of Truth to guide
them in this world for of
deception it is written in Romans

liar allow me to share a story with
you in a small village a father
emphasized the importance of Education
to two of his
sons he was sending them off to a
prestigious
University and he told them that they
could only
succeed if their focus was not
broken so when the two sons came to the
university they encountered a teacher
who was known for his unconventional
teaching
methods the Elder son ignored his
father's
advice he misbehaved he rejected this
teacher's unorthodox
approach and this led to Lost stop
opportunities and
bitterness the youngest son however he
respected his father's guidance and he
stayed focused on his goal embracing the
Unique Style which later contributed to
his personal and academic
[Music]
growth Philippians 4:13 says I can do
all things through Christ who
strengthens
me I want to thank God for the grace to
attend a oneof a kind
University the University of God at
Synagogue Church of all Nations under
the mentorship of prophet T
Joshua glory be to God that my dark past
has become a bright future because my
Focus On Christ was not
broken however not every attendee kept
the
focus
to Briefly summarize my journey at The
Synagogue Church of all
Nations I discovered Prophet TB Joshua
on YouTube in
2010 and it marked a significant turning
point in my life because my faith grew
so
spontaneously that I left all my
possessions everything that I
knew for Lagos Nigeria to stay at The
Synagogue Church of all Nations and
become become a disciple under the
prophet timi Joshua to learn the ways of
the
Lord I called the church my home
immersing myself in this spiritual
Pursuit from November of 2011 until my
departure in November of
2020 tib Joshua explained to us that
some of us need to pass through the
darkness before we can appreciate the
light well I was coming from a past that
was marked by fighting drinking
womanizing and the like that brought me
to the end of my
road the presence of God at the scone
was an embracing light that I appreciate
to this
day Galatians 2:20 says that I have been
crucified with Christ I no longer live
but Christ lives in
me the life I now live in the body I
live by faith in the Son of God Who
Loved Me and gave himself for
me yes my time at the scool was a period
of significant personal
transformation I Crucified My
Swag I Crucified My
slang and I embraced a life of celibacy
from 2011 until the time of my marriage
not to mention my wife who joined
discipleship as a virgin at the age of
16 and she left the virin at the age of
30 just in case you want to know the
kind of life that we were living
in 1 Timothy 68 says if we have food and
clothing we will be content with
that yes to be a disciple of prophet TV
Joshua was not a position of wealth
technically we were volunteer workers we
lived in a church we didn't receive a
salary but we were well taken care of we
were given a weekly allowance to
purchase our breakfast our lunch our
dinner occasionally we were given money
to go and buy the clothes that we needed
or if we traveled to another country for
an assignment we were given more than
enough money to fulfill our
mission we slept in a dormatory we
washed our clothes by hand it was a
total culture shock for me who was
coming from the United
States but it was an experience I
treasure to this day
moreover what I found most
rewarding was witnessing the mighty
power of the hand of God at work
firsthand my eyes cannot say what they
did not
see what my eyes saw during my time at
The Synagogue Church of all Nations was
the authentic Supernatural power of God
in
action the blind see the death hear and
the lame
walk in 1 John 10:21 the people asked
can the demon Open the Eyes of the blind
but now we seem to think
otherwise you see the Miracles were not
brought about by the power or godliness
of any human being but by faith in the
name of Jesus Christ as it says in Acts
3: 11 12 and
16 I will be accountable to my Creator
if I should say that the Miracles at The
Synagogue Church of all nations are
faked we would spend a great deal of
time making sure that people's
testimonies were genuine and that they
had the evidence to back it up I would
be a fool to have left everything that I
owned everything that I knew to follow a
man who was performing fake miracles for
9
[Music]
years but today a generation of
spiritual worshippers are rising up
being driven by the power of the Holy
Ghost it is a testament to the enduring
faith in Christ's
message so people of
God don't let your focus be
broken don't be distracted by the
deception of the
enemy let us win souls for Christ by the
power of his faith hope and love in
Jesus name God bless
you

- [Narrator] The weary gunfighter
walked slowly through the saloon.
The long miles from Cheyenne
had taken their toll.
- Who's saying that stuff?
- [Narrator] He scanned the
room with a suspicious eye.
Years of being on the
wrong side of the law
had taught him that a tough
man can get out of a situation,
but a smart man never
gets himself into one.
- Please quit doing that, I just want to
have a shot of whiskey in peace.
- [Narrator] But the
gunfighter would find no peace.
For the Henderson boys
were waiting in the corner
to kill him for the
$200 bounty on his head.
- Is that true?
You boys trying to kill me
like this voice is saying?
- Uhh...
No.
- [Narrator] Lied the
oldest Henderson boy.
- How do you know I'm lying?
- [Narrator] The oldest
Henderson boy asked of the air.
- No, I didn't ask the air.
I'm asking you, you fuckin' voice.
- [Narrator] Said the
oldest Henderson boy.
- Would you please stop saying
"Said the oldest Henderson boy"?
- [Narrator] Implored Tommy,
the oldest Henderson boy.
Meanwhile, the younger
Henderson's hand twitched
by the Colt Peacemaker on his right hip.
He was thinking of shouting
"Look out behind you"
to trick the gunfighter
into turning around
so he could shoot him in the back.
- No, I was not!
- Come on, Johnny, again
with the "Look behind you"?
What were you gonna say
was behind him this time?
- Uhh, nothing.
- [Narrator] Johnny lied.
He was going to say a bear.
- Oh, come on.
(people laughing)
- A bear, Johnny? In a saloon?
- [Narrator] Johnny's face turned red.
He began wishing he was in a safe place
at home, in bed, with his dolls.
(Johnny scoffs)
Hey, hey, I ain't got no dolls!
- [Narrator] To calm his
nerves, he pictured himself
combing his dolls' hair and
pouring them each a cup of tea.
- No!
- Wait, wait, wait.
You have tea parties with your dolls?
- [Narrator] But something about
the younger Henderson's vulnerability
opened a door in the gunfighter's heart.
- Nope, no it didn't!
- [Narrator] Inside, a
sea of confusing emotions
bubbled to the surface.
- No.
- [Narrator] He started imagining himself
holding the younger Henderson
and stroking his greasy hair.
- No!
- [Narrator] He pictured his first kiss
with the younger Henderson.
- No, that--
- [Narrator] They both
giggle at how clumsy it was.
- No.
- [Narrator] They know the
next one will be even better.
- I'm seriously not picturing that!
- [Narrator] But inside he was.
- No, I'm not!
- [Narrator] But he was.
- No, I'm not and that's the final word.
- [Narrator] But he was.
- Goddamnit!
- Why don't you two go get a room?
- Hey, why should we
trust this voice anyway?
- [Narrator] Just then,
the gunfighter had an idea.
- Hey, you.
- Me?
- Think of a number between one and 100
and then we'll see if this voice
really knows what we're thinkin'!
- Okay, got it.
- [Narrator] Sally the
whore began thinking
of her favorite number, which was 32.
She then thought of her lady
parts and how itchy they were
before deciding to change
her mind and go with 76,
her second favorite number.
- The voice is right!
32 is my favorite number,
but then I changed my
mind and went with 76!
- And your cooch?
- It's been itching something
horrible since Saturday, Bill.
You know anything about that?
- Uhh,
no.
- [Narrator] He did, but
we'll get to that in a minute.
- Looks like that voice
really does know everything.
- [Narrator] The gunfighter
noticed for the first time
that the bartender was black.
This was still unusual in the west,
but the gunfighter decided
he was okay with it.
- Umm, thanks?
- [Narrator] The people in
the town prided themselves
for their progressive
attitudes about race.
- That's right.
- [Narrator] But would
they still feel that way
if they knew that Sam had been sleeping
with Ned Schilling's wife?
- What!?
- Relax, Ned, alright?
I mean, everyone has been with her.
- Guilty.
- Yeah, you're right.
- [Narrator] And Elijah Jessup's sister.
- Welp, it's time for him to die.
(cocking guns)
- Watch yourself, Jessup.
You best put that gun down
or I'll cut you in half.
(ominous music)
- That music,
it seems kind of ominous, don't it?
- Ominous.
What's that mean?
- You know, like, something
bad's about to happen,
like a needless gunfight.
- [Narrator] The stage
was set for an awesome
ballet of death.
Blood would be spilled,
but who would be the first?
- Wait a second.
Ballet of death?
What the hell?
I think this voice wants
us to kill each other.
- [Narrator] Meanwhile, the
gunfighter saw his opening
to shoot Tommy dead.
- No, no, no, wait!
That one really is a lie, see?
My hand's nowhere near my gun.
- [Narrator] Okay, you got me.
That one wasn't true.
But this one is.
Yesterday, Tommy Henderson made sweet love
to Bill Jessup's wife.
- No!
You made sweet love to our mama?
- (laughs uncomfortably)
Here's the thing about that.
- Oh, you're dead, Henderson.
- [Narrator] Said Gabriel,
who had recently delivered
a load of cream to the back
porch of his brother's wife.
He did her in the butt.
- What!?
- How could you? Your own brother!
- [Narrator] Yet even as
Bill reacted with disgust,
the irony was not lost on him.
- You know what, I see
where you're goin' with this
and I'm just gonna retract
my disgust right now
if that's possible.
- [Narrator] For he had
been regularly sneaking
into Paul Valentine's barn.
- Okay, you know, we're
good, we're good here.
I think we should just move on.
- [Narrator] Where he had been having sex
with Paul's favorite sheep Martha.
- Oh boy.
- Marth, Bill!?
Martha!?
- That is why I've been
so itchy? (cocks gun)
- You know what?
We all just need to
take a deep breath here.
We're playin' right
into the voice's hands.
Sure, there's been a surprising amount
of infidelity in this town,
and the bestiality should probably stop,
and I might be gay.
But if we start shootin', the voice wins.
I think the voice is
givin' us an opportunity.
In a world where our
deepest, darkest secrets
are unveiled one by one,
maybe we'll stop doing the
things we're ashamed of
and start to embrace the
things about ourselves
we're afraid to accept.
Hell, this could be the
beginning of a new utopia,
a society based on fairness and tolerance
where it don't matter
if you're rich or poor--
- Or a woman!
- Let's not get carried
away, but the point is,
is that the voice is showing
us the worst side of ourselves
and we need to show it our best.
Now, who's with me?
- [All] Yeehaw!
- [Narrator] It was a good speech
and things might have
turned out differently
if the crowd never found
out that the gunfighter
had just last night shot and killed
the youngest son of John McCullers,
because he "had some
breath that smelled like
"the ass end of a Chinaman."
- Well, you must be Mr. McCullers.
(fires gun)
(guns firing)
- [Narrator] It was a
true ballet of death.
When the gruesome bloodbath was over,
not a single person was left standing,
except for Sally, the itchy whore.
- Yoo!
- [Narrator] Who celebrated
by scratching her front porch.
- [Sally] Whoo!
- [Narrator] Little did she know,
she would be mauled to
death by a rabid wolf
the very next day.
- Well, fuck.
(dramatic orchestral music)

1805, and the Austrian Army is on the march against Napoleon ( it didn't go great).
The man leading this army was Francis II, the Holy Roman Emperor.
He was also the emperor of Austria, a title he created in response to Napoleon declaring himself the Emperor of France.
Because he wasn't about to be 'out-emperored' by anyone. So as far as empires go, the Austrian Empire was fairly run-of-the-mill.
The Holy Roman Empire, however, was not so normal. It was comprised of hundreds of mostly German-speaking
states who swore allegiance to an emperor. The most powerful state in the Holy Roman Empire was Austria, followed by Prussia, and both of these
had territory inside and outside of the Empire because it was
complicated. Having been defeated by Napoleon, Francis gave up his title of Holy Roman Emperor, and the Holy Roman Empire itself was dissolved in
1806. Most of its former states, except notably Prussia and Austria, were brought into the
Confederation of the Rhine, which was a French puppet state. The people that lived in these states were somewhat unhappy living under the dominance
of France, and many quickly began to resent everything French. One way to counter the French influence was to emphasize just how German they were.
So sidenote, the term German was used to refer to people that spoke German. There were Germans,
but no Germany. In some respects, there was a sense of shared identity in culture,
but Germans were also very divided by religion,
economics and politics. So long story short, after Napoleon had been defeated by the Russians, Prussia and Austria rose up against him and by
1815, he had been firmly defeated. After Napoleon's defeat,
The Congress of Vienna was called to establish and maintain a balance of power so that no country could become too powerful.
This balance of power is known as the Concert of Europe. A man called Klemens von Metternich was very important to the
establishment of this new order.
Metternich was an Austrian diplomat who was instrumental in protecting Austria from Napoleon's harsher punishments. As a result of the Congress, Prussia gained this
territory, most notably the Rhineland, and Austria gained this territory in Italy, but lost the Austrian Netherlands
Importantly the German Confederation was formed
It was led by a President, who was also the Emperor of Austria, had these borders which included some of Prussia and Austria,
but not all of Prussia and Austria,
but was also totally not the Holy Roman Empire under a different name.
The German Confederation was quite a loose alliance and as such was seen as quite weak in comparison
to other powers such as France and Russia. This led to some calls for political unification,
which would help protect the smaller German states and prevent a repeat of Napoleon. Prussia was keen on the idea of German
Unification because it, being the largest German state, would be in charge. In
1819, Prussia formed the  Zollverein, which was a customs and trading union which sought to make commerce between German States easier.
This was not just an economic union. Austria was excluded from joining, which meant that there was no economic
counterbalance to Prussia, and by 1848 the Zollverein looked like this.
Throughout the early 19th century liberal ideas were spreading throughout the continent,
and the new middle class wanted reforms such as political
representation and freedom of speech. In Austria, these calls for reform had been repressed by Metternich by
censorship and prosecution. The cries for reform continued to groan, and in
1848, riots broke out across the German Confederation
and Austria. In Austria, the reforms were short-lived, but  Metternich was forced to resign and fled to Britain. Riots in Berlin was suppressed by Prince
Wilhelm of Prussia via cannons, which earned him the nickname, the Prince of Grapeshot.
So the King of Prussia, Friedrich Wilhelm IV,
grudgingly agreed to the establishment of a Parliament which could advise him. The liberal factions involved in the rioting believed that the best way
to secure these reforms was via a Re-Unified Germany. As such, liberals across the German Confederation called the Frankfurt Parliament, which planned to unify Germany
and declare Friedrich Wilhelm IV as its Emperor.
He said no and by late
1849, the Reform Movement had died down. Most of the reforms implemented by the Frankfurt Parliament were quickly abandoned,
but the idea of a unified Germany
persisted. There were two proposals for a unified German State: Kleindeutschland, which means small
Germany, and Grossdeutschland, which means large Germany. The difference was that Grossdeutschland included the German-speaking parts of the Austrian Empire, whereas
Kleindeutschland did not. This idea of a shared ethnic, cultural and linguistic heritage or destination is an important part of
nationalism. For more homogeneous places like Germany
or Italy, nationalism was a uniting factor. For ethnically diverse empires, such as Russia or Austria, it was a destabilizing force.
For example, in Austria the Hungarians attempted to break away in 1848,
but this was prevented due to intervention from the Russians.
The Austrians were opposed to a unified Germany which they weren't in charge of. Austria wasn't the only opponent of a unified Germany.
France and Russia were quite nervous about the idea as well.
Austria was able to rely on Russian pressure to dissuade the Prussians from pursuing Kleindeutschland, and maintain the German Confederation.
Russian support for Austria ended in 1854 when Austria refused to help Russia in the Crimean war against Britain, France and the Ottoman Empire.
A few years later,
Austria was defeated by France and Sardinia, and thus lost this territory in northern Italy. Whilst Austria was weakening, Prussia found itself gaining strength.
Prussia was rapidly industrializing, had access to a great amount of natural resources such as coal, and was a major producer of iron.
The Zollverein also allowed Prussia to export these products, and its economy grew in strength.
So in 1861, Friedrich Wilhelm died and was succeeded by his brother Wilhelm I, the aforementioned Prince of Grapeshot.
The next year, he appointed a man called Otto von Bismarck as the Minister President of Prussia.
Bismarck was a very gifted
Statesman and firmly opposed to the liberal forces in Prussia. He sought to unify the northern German States, remove Austria from the German Confederation
and strengthen the position and prestige of the Prussian King. One of the first things that Bismarck did was to modernize and increase the size of the
Prussian military, in case his plan led to war.
They did. The first broke out in
1864, after Denmark had declared that both Schleswig and Holstein were Danish territory. Holstein was in the German Confederation, and in retaliation
Prussia and Austria declared war on Denmark, which they quickly won.
So Prussia received Schleswig and Austria received Holstein.
Austria was unhappy with the results of the war because the new
territories were part of the Zollverein, and Austria needed to travel through Prussian territory to get to its own.
Bismarck knew that this arrangement would lead to war with Austria, and so made sure that the other European nations stayed out of it.
He made a defensive pact with the newly-unified Kingdom of Italy, on the condition that Italy would gain Venetia from Austria.
He was also supportive for French and Russian ambitions to keep them neutral.
Eventually, Austria tried to resolve the issue surrounding Holstein, and Bismarck accused the Austrians of treating them like enemies. Prussian troops occupied
Holstein in June
1866. Most of the German Confederation backed Austria, and war broke out shortly
afterwards. Fortunately for Prussia, the Italians mobilized on the Austrian border and declared war five days later.
Prussia quickly defeated Austria's northern allies and Austria had lost the war within two months. One of the reasons for this was that Prussian troops
were armed with a new type of rifle: the needle gun. The Austrians fared much better against the Italians, but their losses against Prussia
led them to surrender. In the end, Prussia gained all of this territory, which became the North German Confederation,
with its own parliament. Austria also agreed to give up Venetia, but because they had generally outperformed the Italians,
they gave it to France instead, who then gave it to Italy, because 19th century war was weird.
So the rapid rise of Prussia was something that the French not anticipated. In
1870, the German Prince Leopold,
Wilhelm I's cousin, was offered the Spanish crown. The French Emperor Napoleon III did not want the North German Confederation
to gain Spain as an ally, and demanded that Wilhelm order his cousin not to take the crown. Wilhelm told the French
he'll get back to them, and so sent a telegram to Bismarck. Bismarck edited the telegram
so it sounded like Wilhelm rudely brushed the French off, and published it. This made the French
look weak and silly,
so they declared war. So the French declaring war made them the aggressors, and thus the
Prussians were able to gain the support of the Southern German States.
So to summarize the war, the French couldn't mobilize as many men, the French Emperor was captured, the French had another
revolution because it was the 19th century, and so at this point
why not? The Germans pushed this far into French territory and on the 18th of January
1871, at the Palace of the side, the German leaders declared the creation of the German Empire,
with Wilhelm I as emperor. The French soon after surrendered, agreeing to pay indemnities and giving Germany the territory of Alsace-Lorraine.
So one of the great debates surrounding the German Empire is to what extent it was unification,
or simply Prussian dominance. The smaller German States felt that they were unable to protect themselves from their larger neighbors,
but in return for protection, found themselves dominated by Prussia,
except for Liechtenstein, which was fine. The dominance of Prussia is best seen through
what is known as the Kulturkampf,  the culture struggle.
So northern Germany was mostly Protestant, while the south had a large Catholic population.
The Catholic Church had immense political authority, and Bismarck wished to remove its influence and strengthen the central government.
Catholic bishops were arrested on mass, and Catholic institutions were sidelined,
but ultimately it persevered. A unified Germany quickly became a great power. Bismarck negotiated an alliance with the
Austro-Hungarian Empire, and managed to secure some African colonies by calling the Berlin Conference with the other European powers. It
experienced a population boom alongside rapid industrialization and urbanization, and also became a global center of science.
Wilhelm I died in 1888.
He was replaced by Friedrich III, who died 99 days later.
And he was followed by Wilhelm II. Wilhelm wanted to assert his own independence, and so encouraged Bismarck to resign in
1890. Unlike his predecessors, Wilhelm II was very hot-headed and prone to immediate reaction.
He was also determined to increase the prestige of Germany. He did this by undertaking a major naval build-up in the early 20th century.
This upset Britain. Britain had previously kept itself out of European affairs,
but the large German navy posed a threat to its naval hegemony and could even threaten the British mainland. So in
1914, the Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated by a Serbian nationalist,
and the established series of alliances and counter-alliances plunged Europe into World War One.
Long story short,
Germany was unable to break the stalemate that formed, its allies collapsed and a British blockade meant that a major food shortage occurred. War fatigue
and hunger
led many to protest, and eventually revolt.
Revolt became full-on revolution, and Wilhelm abdicated on the night of November 1918.
A republic was declared which soon after accepted the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which ultimately led to the conditions which
precipitated the rise of the Nazi Party. In conclusion,
it's hard to overstate the effect of German unification.
The rise of Prussia ended Austria's dominance over Central Europe and ushered in the end of the balance of power
established at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. The strength of the new German Empire alongside its foreign policy
paved the way for World War One, and  the new world which was left in its wake.

As one of the lesser-known but nonetheless vital 
precious metals, platinum has a long history  
of being used for jewelry and ornamentation, 
reaching back to the ancient Egyptian empire,  
having been discovered on a coffin unearthed in 
Thebes estimated to be from the 7th century BC.  
Platinum is a metal that 
represents power, prestige,  
and a sense of great accomplishment. It has come 
to symbolize a high level of status in society,  
as evidenced by top tier credit cards 
and membership programs using its name,  
but platinum is so much more than just a status 
symbol. Modern day uses of platinum include being  
a key element in catalytic converters for 
vehicles, as it converts car exhaust gases  
into less harmful substances, as a catalyst in 
the chemical industry, and even in the creation  
of life-saving anti-cancer drugs. But that's 
just scratching the surface. On today's episode,  
we explore this exclusive metal that befuddled 
miners and scientists alike when it was first  
discovered. Dubbed platina, or 'little silver', 
by the Spanish conquistadors, the truth is  
it's so much more than meets the eye. Time 
to dig into platinum, on Commodity Culture.
Platinum is a gray-white precious metal and 
one of a group of six elements known as the  
platinum group metals. The other metals in the 
group are iridium, osmium, palladium, rhodium,  
and ruthenium. Platinum is the most common of 
the group and sees the most use. Platinum's  
atomic number is 78, it has an atomic mass of 195 
units, a melting point of 1768 degrees celsius,  
and is resistant to corrosion, 
stable at high temperatures,  
and has stable electrical properties. The name 
platinum comes from the spanish word platina,  
basically translating to little silver. This 
somewhat derogatory word was coined by Spanish  
conquistadors in the 16th century as they 
had no idea of platinum's uses or true value  
and considered it an annoyance that interfered 
with their attempts to mine gold. In those times,  
it was widely believed that platina was young 
gold and that given time, it would turn yellow  
as it matured but until then, better to toss it 
aside and get back to mining for the real thing.  
Platinum is rarely found on its own. It 
is often deposited alongside gold, copper,  
iron nickel, and of course the other platinum 
group metals. When discovered, platinum can be  
quite inconspicuous at first glance, with nuggets 
having a dull gray or black hue. One thing that  
can help identify it is its incredible heft when 
held and if iron is also present in the alloy,  
it will be slightly magnetic. Some of the first 
known platinum jewelry was crafted by the ancient  
indigenous peoples of Ecuador, with estimates 
placing their culture several centuries before  
the Spanish conquest of South America in 1492. 
It was particularly in the province of Esmeraldas  
where some of the most striking pieces were found, 
leading anthropologist William Farabee to declare:  
"The native Indian workers of Esmeraldas 
were metallurgists of marked ability.  
They were the only people who manufactured 
platinum jewelry." Considering platinum is  
far more difficult to forge and manipulate than 
say, gold or silver, the method these ancient  
peoples used to work such a problematic metal 
was nothing short of incredible and a testament  
to their dedication to their craft. Platinum 
fragments were coated with gold dust then  
heated by blowpipe on pieces of wood charcoal. The 
molten gold then caused the platinum to sinter,  
meaning coalesce into a porous mass through 
heating, which then allowed it to be forged. Being  
the rarest of all the precious metals, along with 
its incredible strength as the hardest among them,  
has led platinum to being one of the preferred 
forms of jewelry throughout the ages. In addition,  
it is highly resistant to scratches and other 
blemishes and does not wear away easily. Platinum,  
along with the other platinum group metals 
has strong catalytic properties, meaning  
it can accelerate or trigger a chemical process 
without becoming permanently changed or consumed.  
For this reason, it is employed widely in 
the manufacturing of catalytic converters  
for use in exhaust systems in internal combustion 
vehicles. Platinum present in exhaust systems  
helps curb vehicle pollution and contributes 
to enhanced air quality. Catalytic converters  
represent a whopping 50 percent of platinum 
demand each year. Due to its high melting point,  
platinum is indispensable in chemical laboratories 
for electrodes and for crucibles and dishes  
in which materials can be heated to high 
temperatures. In addition, platinum is used in the  
chemicals industry as a catalyst to produce nitric 
acid, benzene, and silicone. It is also used as a  
catalyst to improve the efficiency of fuel cells 
and for electrical contacts and sparking points,  
as it resists both the high temperatures and 
chemical attack of electric arcs. Platinum finds  
use in the electronics sector in the manufacturing 
of computer hard disks and thermocouples,  
is used to make optical fibers and LCD screens, 
turbine blades, spark plugs, pacemakers, and like  
other precious metals, is used widely in dentistry 
crowns, bridges, pins, and other dental equipment,  
as well as fillings, all employ platinum as a key 
component. But one of its most impactful uses to  
humanity is in the creation of chemotherapy drugs 
used to treat cancer, of which platinum compounds  
are an important building block. I'm willing 
to bet you didn't think platinum was such an  
essential element to our day-to-day lives but the 
truth is, it's a metal that is as practical as it  
is prestigious. Next up, let's explore the mining 
methods used to extract platinum from the earth.
Being one of the rarest metals on earth, 
platinum is almost never found on its own  
but is generally found alongside platinum group 
metals, nickel, iron, gold, and other metals.  
Although pure platinum deposits have 
been discovered, they are the exception  
rather than the rule. One of the earliest 
platinum mining methods is placer mining.  
Like gold, platinum particles can accumulate 
in alluvial sands in rivers and streams.  
Placer deposits are concentrated sand and gravel 
beds in streams and rivers created when old rock  
is eroded from its source and further ground into 
pieces as it is washed away by the water. Most of  
the world's placer platinum is found in Russia 
and back in the 19th century, alluvial deposits  
located in the Ural mountains were heavily 
mined by both small-scale family operations  
and more official mining operations. Placer mining 
for platinum was also common in South America,  
especially in the Rio de la Plata, or the river 
of silver, located between Argentina and Uruguay.  
Placer mining involves using dredges to scoop 
platinum-bearing sand or gravel from river beds  
and washing it until platinum grains or nuggets 
are captured and separated from the surrounding  
material. In today's world, the vast majority 
of platinum deposits are located underground  
and this is mined very similarly to gold, 
silver, and other underground metal deposits,  
namely, with strategically placed explosives. 
Miners drill holes into the mine walls and pack  
explosives into them before detonating the rock, 
blasting it into small pieces and hauling it up to  
the surface to be loaded onto trucks, which 
then take it to a facility to be processed.  
Most platinum mining in the modern era is done 
in South Africa, which accounts for a whopping  
80 percent of world platinum production. The story 
of the man who first identified platinum and began  
to make it known to the greater world is no less 
fantastic than the element itself, involving  
an adventure across continents, a capture and 
daring escape on the high seas, and a scientific  
discovery that would begin platinum's journey to 
becoming the dynamic metal we know it as today.
Antonio de Uloa of Spain was only 19 years 
of age when he was promoted to the rank of  
Frigate Lieutenant and sent on what would be a 
life-altering expedition to Quito in Ecuador,  
led by French geographers Charles Marie 
de la Condamine and Pierre Bouguer.  
Antonio departed Spain in May of 1735, not knowing 
he wouldn't see his motherland again for more than  
a decade. The mission was a monumental one, 
to help determine whether the earth was flat,  
as was popularly believed throughout most of 
human history up to that point or whether it  
was a sphere, as suggested by Sir Isaac Newton. 
To this end, it was necessary to measure the  
length of a degree of longitude at the equator, 
of which Quito was the closest city, and again  
it's somewhere as near as possible to one of the 
poles. An expedition to the far north of Sweden  
was also dispatched for this purpose but our story 
shall leave that journey to the pages of history.  
As Antonio accompanied the geographers in Ecuador, 
their task proved epic indeed and with great  
struggle, they finally completed their work around 
1745. Over the course of this decade, Antonio had  
plenty of time to explore the territory and the 
people there, recording his more interesting  
observations in various papers he carried with 
him. As the expedition finally departed back to  
Spain, their mission accomplished, Antonio 
must have been filled with strong emotions,  
as he was at long last headed home. Fate 
however, had other plans in store for him.  
As they made their way, sailing around Cape 
Horn, they were chased down north of the Azores  
by an English privateer, and their ship was 
captured. However, they managed an escape and  
as luck seemed to be on their side, they evaded 
their captors and seemed to leave danger behind.  
But God seemed intent to test their wills and 
as they'd reached Louisburg in Nova Scotia,  
their vessel was once again captured, this 
time by a British naval vessel and escape was  
out of the question. Antonio and his companions 
were taken to London and imprisoned, while the  
admiralty confiscated nearly a decade's worth 
of notes from Antonio's time spent in Ecuador.  
Things looked grim for our Frigate Lieutenant as 
he sat in a cell, awaiting his fate. But when God  
closes a door, he is known to open a window, and 
good fortune came in the form of the president  
of the Royal Society, Martin Folkes, who came to 
know Antonio and his story, and befriended him.  
The Royal Society were a group of 
natural philosophers and physicians  
and not only did Martin free Antonio from his 
chains, he got all his papers returned to him  
and even made him a fellow of the Royal Society 
in 1746. He was then allowed to return to Spain.  
Finally back after his long mission, he set to 
work compiling an account of his adventures which  
he published in 1748, first in Spanish and then 
had it translated into several other languages.For  
the purposes of our subject today, one passage in 
particular stands out: "In the district of choco  
are many mines of lavadero, or wash gold. Several 
of the mines have been abandoned on account of  
the platina, a substance of such resistance that 
when struck on an anvil of steel, it is not easy  
to be separated nor is it calcinable, so that 
the metal enclosed within this obdurate body  
could only be extracted with infinite labor 
and charge." Shortly after releasing his book,  
Antonio was tasked with a new mission by the 
king of Spain himself, King Ferdinand VI,  
to travel throughout Europe and study scientific 
developments across the continent. His travels  
brought him to Sweden in the autumn of 1751 and he 
was welcomed with open arms by Swedish scientists.  
Shortly after his arrival, he was duly elected 
to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in  
October of the same year. During his time 
there, he met with mathematician and chemist  
H.T. Scheffer. Scheffer was a former mine and 
metal works manager, as well as an assayer at  
the mint, and so had quite a vested interest 
in metals. There is no official record of what  
exactly was said in that meeting, but shortly 
thereafter in November of 1751, Scheffer produced  
a paper titled "The White Gold, or Seventh 
Metal, Called in Spain Platina del Pinto,  
Little Silver of Pinto, its Nature Described," 
and submitted it to the academy. Scheffer was  
already familiar with platinum before encountering 
Antonio as he himself had received samples of it  
just a year earlier in 1750, from the West 
Indies, but his time with Antonio undoubtedly  
influenced his writing. In the paper, he came 
to the following conclusions about platinum:  
"That this is a metal hard but malleable, 
but of the hardness of malleable iron.  
That it is a precious metal of durability, like 
gold and silver. That it is not any of the six old  
metals since first, it is wholly and entirely a 
precious metal, containing nothing of copper, tin,  
lead, or iron, because it allows nothing to be 
taken from it. It is not silver, nor is it gold,  
but it is a seventh metal among those which are 
known up till now in all lands." In addition, he  
recommended a potential practical application for 
platinum when he wrote: "This metal is the most  
suitable of all to make telescope mirrors, because 
it resists as well as gold the vapors of the air.  
It is very heavy, very dense, colorless and much 
heavier than ordinary gold, which is rendered  
unsuitable for this particular use by lacking 
these two latter properties." Although attempts  
were made in the years that followed, platinum 
never found its place in telescopes of the era,  
although Scheffer would be delighted to 
know the metal did eventually find use  
in the construction of X-ray telescopes 
centuries later. Nonetheless, his paper sparked  
the imaginations of scientists across the world 
and a flurry of research into platinum began,  
leading it to be established as the multi-faceted 
metal that we know in the modern era.
Although the recent trend towards electrifying 
vehicles seemingly puts platinum's use in  
traditional gasoline-powered catalytic converters 
at risk, we need to step back and look at the  
bigger picture. In the coming years, auto-catalyst 
demand for platinum is actually likely to rise,  
as recent legislation to curb pollution from 
gasoline and diesel engines is boosting the demand  
for cleaner emissions, which is platinum's forte. 
Either way, platinum will have a role to play in  
a carbon neutral future as it is needed for 
hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric vehicles.  
These use a propulsion system similar to that of 
electric vehicles, where energy stored as hydrogen  
is converted to electricity by the fuel cell, and 
these vehicles are already becoming available in  
California and a few other places. Platinum is 
also playing a role in the greater energy economy,  
as platinum-based fuel cells are a cost-effective, 
clean, and reliable off-grid power source  
that is currently seeing use in some remote areas 
such as rural South Africa. These fuel cells can  
help provide greater energy access to communities 
who might not normally be able to get a steady  
source of electricity. This includes electricity 
for schools, improving the quality of education,  
and provides the ability to pump water for 
irrigation, facilitating agriculture. Its other  
myriad of uses also aren't going away and for this 
reason, platinum will remain an essential metal  
to our modern civilization for as long 
as we can extract it from the earth.

Malacca
haguro and her escort the Destroyer
Kamikaze left Singapore on May 9th and
headed north up the Malacca Strait
the cruiser was skippered by Captain
Kaiju sugira and had his Superior rear
Apple Hashimoto on board
but when Japanese air reconnaissance
spotted a British Fleet on its way East
hagura was ordered back south trying to
avoid an unwinnable confrontation and
hope that the Ally Fleet would
eventually go away
frustrated by the failure of huguro to
steam obligingly into the Trap laid for
her vice admiral Walker took his Fleet
to the Southwest for refueling from the
tanker Echo Dale on May 13th
while he did so the Japanese transport
kuroshoyo Maru slipped through the net
steaming from Penang to nankauri in the
andamans by May 14th encouraged by the
lack of Allied response to this sortie
haguro decided to have another go at the
voyage starting its way North again on
May 14th
by early the following day vice admiral
Walker had committed some of his ships
well to the east in a hunt for the
kuroshoyo Maru which was now on its way
back to Malaya having picked up troops
at Port Blair
the five destroyers of the 26th Attila
under Captain manly power were rattling
along at 27 knots while Avengers
launched from HMS Emperor Street
overhead on the hunt for Japanese
shipping
at around 10 AM three aircrafts spotted
and attacked the ikiroshoyo Maru with
bombers but without success losing two
Avengers in the process
at almost the same time Captain power
aboard HMS salmares received the signal
from the fleet shore-based headquarters
at Colombo ordering his fatilla back to
the South West as with no sign of her
Guru it was believed there was no
Prospect of catching it but Captain
power guessing that whoever had sent the
order would not have known about these
 that had just been attacked by The
Avengers decided to ignore this order
for the time being
he held his ships on the same North
easterly Course while signaling back to
ask for a confirmation to the orders in
light of the reports from the aircraft
whilst waiting at 11 50 power picked up
another report from a second wave of
carrier aircraft identifying one
Japanese Cruiser and one Destroyer south
of the Kuroshio maru's position
the Destroyer soon received permission
to sink enemy ships before returning to
the fleet and set off in Pursuit the
hunt for huguro was on
haguro meanwhile had been warned by the
Japanese outposts on the Northern tip of
Sumatra of the approach of Allied Naval
and Air Forces and was not about to hang
around to find out exactly what kind
the cruiser and her escort swung
background to the South and steamed for
Singapore
the Allied Forces set off in Pursuit
with Captain Powers destroyed 130 miles
from the Enemy by 12 10 pm
they steadily closed the distance while
hagura was occupying with defending of
air attacks by more Avengers through the
afternoon
but as afternoon turned to evening the
Destroyers turned southwards following
her Guru into the Malacca Strait and
rearranging themselves into a single
liner breast keeping a keen eye out for
their powerful opponent
a more than 15 000 tons fully loaded
haguro displaced more than all five of
Captain Powers destroyers combined and
with 10 8-inch and eight 5-inch guns
packed a much bigger punch
she was also a distinguished and
experienced ship having 14 battles
including the Java sea the Battle of
Midway and laity Gulf
in a gun battle at any sort of range in
daylight Powers Destroyer for tiller
would barely stand their chance of
getting close let alone sinking her Guru
but the Japanese Cruiser's Achilles heel
was its speed once able to do 33 knots
years of war service without proper
refill had left her boilers and turbines
ailed and only able to produce around 25
knots slower than the British destroyers
could do
and so the range between the two groups
of ships slowly came down until at 10 40
PM the radar onward HMS Venus detected a
large contact to the northwest
Venus's Bridge crew were initially
skeptical of the contact believing it to
possibly be a cloud but when the
suspected Cloud was seen to sharply
altercourse to the south at 11 32 it was
clear that it was the Japanese warship
they were after
Captain power took his ships further
south to cut her Guru off and then at 12
15 am turned North spreading his ships
into an attack formation with HMS Venus
and verulam as the most advanced ships
on each side
a few miles away steaming South
oblivious to the Trap awaiting them was
the cruiser haguro with the escort in
Kamikaze trailing behind
the Japanese ships were pushing to reach
the safety of Singapore but had been
slowed by the relative inexperience in
these Waters of her Navigator Commander
OTA who required a slower speed to be
certain of avoiding minefields
as a result Hashimoto and Captain sugira
had calculated that any pursuing force
would catch up around 1am if they
maintained the pursuit into the small
hours
despite knowing this according to
Lieutenant Commander is Samo motora the
officer of the watch unaccountably
failed to raise the alarm when Lookout
spotted a line of Destroyers approaching
nine miles away
it was not until 12 50 that the captain
realized what was happening and took
control of the ship by which time the
British destroyers were just 6 000 yards
ahead and closing rapidly
Sakura ordered a hard star but turn and
opened fire on the nearest Destroyer on
the port side which was verilim
the Cruisers swung round but straight
into the teeth of Venus on the opposite
flank
the Destroyer closed to 4 000 yards
lined itself up and then promptly
flunked its torpedo attack by having the
incorrect angle set which would have
meant a certain Miss
unable to launch Venus hauled away
sharply to the West trying to keep
haguro encircled seeing this sugura
assumed the enemy ship had launched
Torpedoes and began another hard turn to
starboard coming back round eventually
to a southerly course and now steaming
straight for the oncoming salmares and
the Vigilant at the center of the
British formation
Kamikaze meanwhile in its attempts to
keep up with huguro's erratic
maneuvering had ended up ahead of its
companion clothing on salmares at a
combined speed of almost 60 knots
Captain power took evasive action and
samares of raped the Destroyer with
anti-aircraft fire as it passed down its
port side
the British ship tried to turn and
Engage The Destroyer but Kamikaze
Slipped Away into the darkness
meanwhile the situation around herguro
was now totally chaotic with the cruiser
being assailed on almost all sides by
hostile ships
at around 2 10 Salman resin verulam made
near simultaneous attack runs on the
North and South East
haguro concentrated its fire on salmares
and blazed away with eight and five inch
shells knocking out one of the
destroyer's boiler rooms just as it was
launching torpedoes
meanwhile at 114 Captain Douglas Bromley
of verulam fired a full soundfo of eight
Torpedoes having been able to approach
without receiving any fire before
setting off to the Northeast the try and
cut off hagura's Escape
the oncoming Torpedoes from a virulum
were spotted on her Guru and an
emergency turn to starboard was ordered
but it was too late and the Turn Only
carried it into the spread fired by
salmares three hits were observed
probably from a combination of salmares
and verilim's torpedoes a large fire
began the taguro stern its speed dropped
and the cruiser began to list rapidly
as captain segura's ship founded it came
under Fire from all directions as the
British fatilla came in to finish her
off
rear Admiral Hashimoto ordered Kamikaze
to save itself with a retreat to Penang
shortly before a British shell
demolished haguro's Bridge killing
almost everyone there
a 124 HMS Venus began her second attempt
at attacking haguro with a salvo of six
Torpedoes launched from the north
three minutes later on the opposite side
of the stricken Cruiser Virago followed
suit launching seven torpedoes
with Torpedoes flying all over the place
the British were extremely lucky not to
hit each other twice during the battle
Venus's crew reported hearing the sound
of torpedoes passing right by the ship
hakuro was not so lucky three more hits
were scored on the cruiser which by now
was stationary listing over dramatically
but still afloat and still with her guns
blazing away even with most of these
senior officers on board dead or wounded
31 Torpedoes have now been fired and
still her guro refused to go down so the
British ships came in again
a 150 HMS Vigilant 5 8 more Torpedoes
followed by a final attack from Venus
with her last two at least two more hits
were observed and herguro finally began
to sink
a 206 Venus signaled Captain power of
the enemy Cruiser had been sunk and the
British fatilla began to retire to the
north having sustained only minor damage
and the loss of two men aboard salmares
the day after the battle Kamikaze
returned to the sights of figuro's
sinking where it found hundreds of
sailors clinging to wreckage and
lifeboats 320 were able to be rescued
with another 751 lost with the ship
including Captain Segura and rear apron
Hashimoto
the sinking of haguro in the Malacca
Strait was the last gun battle between
major surface warships of the second
world war and it underlined the degree
to which the Allied Powers had taken
total control of the sea it was a
control they used to squeeze Japan into
eventual submission three months later

would you mind
don't worry honey the doctor will check
her out oh thank
uh mr god langley any kind of damage to

the Daran Gap 100 km of rainforest
separating Panama and Colombia it's one
of the key migration routes in the world
today people in my country are starving
many are dying it's been a dictatorship
for 60 years that's why I sold my house
and
left more than half a million people
made the journey in 2023 alone it may be
a tiny step towards the us but it's by
far the
hardest I want a better life for my
children and my parents they're all I
[Music]
[Music]
have the route begins in Northern
Colombia nikle was known as a vacation
resort today migrants wait here before
entering the
rainforest travel to Panama is sold for
$2 to
$400 for some it's much more than they
have those who can afford it border a
boat that will carry them across the
Gulf of
[Music]
uraba
after the crossing several routes lead
into the Darion but the cheapest and
most arduous is via
kugan for those who paid a package price
to Panama back in nikog Le it's usually
at this point where they discover
they've been swindled the migrants have
to pay
again talk with the guys and
[Applause]
negotiate I've been here for 4 days
we're negotiating every day there were
14 of us and now there's only four of us
we'll do our best but we need your
support
too Darwin Alias maradon is The
Smuggler's boss he calls them guides
they'll take people to the Panama border
for around
$150 bringing migrants to Panama counts
as smuggling in Colombia and is
illegal do you want these guys to die on
the Darian route like they used to or
would you rather we make them pay for a
safe route that's not taking advantage
they have to cross we provide the
service it's an Open Secret that it's
Colombia's most powerful crime syndicate
the clan Del go for calling the shots
here there's evidence that Smugglers are
forced to make payments to the clan
despite proclamations from the
governments of Colombia the US and
Panama military presence here is minimal
back in April it was said they would
halt migration within 2
months this is where the route through
the jungle Begins the first first group
of the day sets off around midday
Joseline baros a single mother from
Venezuela is traveling with her three
children in Colombia I wound up earning
too little
money what did you work
as in customer service in a cafe as a
street vendor anything I could find as
long as it was a decent
job
why couldn't you just take a flight to
Panama it's too expensive passports
especially cost a lot of money for
Venezuelans earning that much on your
own it can't be
done Juan Bautista comes from Cuba he is
traveling alone the hopes of his family
are riding on him if I make it I'll send
money to my family that's my goal that
gives me strength my family doesn't
really want me to take the risk but I
have
to
the majority of migrants currently
taking this route are Venezuelans
they're joined by ecuadorians Cubans
even Afghans Chinese and somalis none of
them see an alternative to the Daran
route but many underestimate the
danger it's not just only the presence
of armed groups that can be perilous for
the migrants nature itself can pose a
threat Joselina is having difficulty
keeping up her fellow Travelers help her
with the
children the woman's
tired the hike today lasts around 8
hours in the evening around halfast 7
the group arrives at Camp here they're
only 20 minutes away from
Panama joselene and and her children
have made it so
far we lost all the supplies everything
all the food I got upset of course I
started crying because I don't know what
to do now with no money and no food for
the
children I can go on with only water but
it's about the
children children and my parents are all
I
have I have no one
else when I'm over there when with God's
help I'm doing well I'll bring my
parents
too but I couldn't leave the little ones
with my
parents they'd be too much of a burden
you
know at the camp there's food and
electricity from the generator but
everything costs even the next section
of the journey the migrants now must pay
$60 to get to Panama the group has to
hold out at least three more days in
Darion three three days of uncertainty
many are unable to pay the Smugglers not
even Juan from
Cuba others who have been through here
have told me it's dangerous that are
paramilitary units that are drug dealers
anything can happen in the jungle and
they offer no security I'd like to have
the money to pay because it's only fair
security is worth a lot I don't want to
die here I want to make the dream come
true for my
family
on the other side of the Darion lies
Panama here some 50 km north of the
Colombian border is the base for
Panama's Border
[Music]
Police Jerry Rodriguez is an officer
with a Border Police Special Operation
St Brigade he's experienced frequent
clashes with armed groups and has also
encountered the guides but they fled
every
time for us these guides are coyotes
just traffickers if someone runs it's
because they're not obeying the law I
think the migrant issue is mainly about
money Jerry and his colleagues have
often recovered bodies from the forest
but so far they haven't received any
additional help though migration through
Darion was meant to have been stopped
months
ago we've been told we'll see
improvements soon but we're still
waiting Jerry is later called to another
body recovery operation in the Darion at
least
258 people have lost their lives here
since
2018 here in Panama Border Police do not
stop the migrants but help them get
safely to the Border with Costa
Rica the journey up River to K gas takes
roughly 6 and 1 half hours this is where
most of the migrants currently emerge
from the Darion the worst section of the
route is now behind
them osbel Anna hose and their three
children have just
arrived fallen down often but we have to
keep
going for a good future for my children
for them to be well for them to not want
for anything for them to
study we have to pray to God keep on
with God's
help from here the route continues by
boat and the last of the day are just
leaving these migrants have surv
survived the Daran Gap but many who
cannot afford the boat ride will have to
wait here in improvised camps until one
of the drivers takes pity on them and
offers a free
ride bahoi Kito is 45 minutes down river
the indigenous Village is the first
populated area that the migrants see
again only a few hundred people live
here but over a thousand migrants
currently arrive each day
Ana and osel got lucky and were able to
travel in one of the boats for free
their money ran out long
ago we're feeling better now because we
have arrived in a safer camp at least we
got out of the Jungle thank
[Music]
God Anna you take the kid I'll get the
tent there's a first aid post here and a
kind of State
registration take your child with
you the woman can do the
registration later that afternoon
joselene suddenly appears in the village
with her children they're wearing shirts
and pants that fellow Travelers have
given them for the first time in days
the children are given something to
eat see
I need something to
drink Joseline tells us about how her
group was
attacked our guide suddenly came to us
with several masked people they had guns
they told us to stop because if we
didn't they'd send us all
back thank God they let me
through I was alone with the children
one of the men with the guns told me to
just keep
walking I escaped with a scare but there
were people they took money
from the last stop in Panama for the
migrants is a reception Camp further
Downstream here Border Police put them
on buses that take them to the Costa
Rican border the trip costs $40 per
person no we don't know anything let's
see what they tell us up there but we're
getting closer and closer now
Six National borders still lie between
anah hose and osel and the United States
as a deserting soldier from Venezuela
osbel may have a good chance of being
granted Asylum but nothing is certain
things it's the most powerful country
the country that is most likely to help
migrants today it's our only option if
an opportunity arises in another country
if someone grants us a residency permit
then we'll go
there this part of the migration to the
us alone cost some
$500 a flight from Colombia to Mexico is
just half of that within a few months
osbel anahi and joselene have all
arrived in the US whether they'll be
allowed to stay is uncertain but at
least they have survived the treacherous
Journey Through the Daran
Gap

it's not often that the land sandwiched
between great empires can survive
centuries of warfare and still come out
independent especially one whose people
speaks the same language as its larger
neighbor and jet mantova is one of those
lands and here it is today a sovereign
nation but why why does Moldova exist
so to begin Moldova or more davier as
it's been known through most of his
history is an old Romanian speaking
nation whose origins are in the 14th
century after it told the Hungarians
that it wasn't interested in being their
vassal anymore it spent the next century
fighting of the kingdom of Hungary
Valachi ER in the Polish Lithuanian
Commonwealth with varying levels of
success before the Ottomans turned up
who made it into a vassal in the early
16th century
now given Moldova's position on the
borders of the ottoman empire it should
be no surprise that it was a place which
saw war fairly often and much of that
war was with the recently expanded
Russian Empire and these two went to war
a lot and in 1812 half of Madhavi
islands collectively known as Bessarabia
were annexed into the russian empire in
1859 as a result of losing the Crimean
War the Russians handed over this
territory to what was left of Moldavia
which promptly formed the united
provinces with Valachi which would soon
afterwards take the name romania due to
some conflicts over access to the Danube
Russia ended up getting these lands back
a mere 20 years later time marched on
and World War one as you know Romania
joined the auntaunt got squashed in then
rejoined when the Central Powers were on
the back foot when the war was over in
the Russian Empire had collapsed because
Lenin Romania jumped on the opportunity
with the support of BES Arabia's
politicians annexed the region before it
expanded to this after the Treaty of
Trianon so into the 20th century Moldova
was a part of Romania and the people who
lived there were perfectly happy with
this arrangement someone who wasn't
happy with the arrangement was Joseph
Stalin who wanted Bessarabia back under
the control of Moscow in 1939 the USSR
in Germany signed the Molotov Ribbentrop
pact which secretly divided Eastern
Europe up between him and acknowledged
Soviet ownership of Bessarabia the next
year Stalin gave Romania an ultimatum
give his best arabia or we'll just take
it anyway Romania acquiesced in the USSR
annex the region during the course of
World War 2 Romania briefly occupied the
region again but that wouldn't last
these lands were transferred with the
Ukraine and the rest became the more
Davian Soviet Socialist Republic over
its lifetime in the USSR the government
was keen to stress that the Moldavian
and Romanian people's were different it
implemented linguistic reforms which
meant that the Moldavian language
use the Cyrillic alphabet as opposed to
the Latin one which Romania had adopted
in the previous century throughout its
time in the USSR Moldova was a sore spot
in relations between Moscow and
Bucharest and Romania's politicians made
it clear that they still believed it to
be a rightful part of Romania like all
of the things Soviet the Moldavian SSR
began tying in the late 1980s this was
when Gorbachev opened up the press and I
allowed the Soviet republics to discuss
their futures in the hopes that these
new freedoms would maintain the USSR but
fun fact
no Moldavia independence movement sprang
up quickly and Representatives there
reversed the adoption of the Cyrillic
alphabet and they soon afterwards
declared the Moldavia and Romanian
people to be one and the same you should
know though that there were many there
who wish to remain a part of the USSR
and when independence seemed inevitable
they themselves declared independence
they created the state of Transnistria
which still exists to this day but isn't
recognized by many nations
so why didn't Moldavia which soon took
the name Moldova join Romania well part
of it was timing Romania was having its
own troubles with anti-communist
revolution when the dust from that was
settled Gorbachev pressured the new
president to respect the USSR's borders
which he did and after that much of the
potential momentum was gone because
despite the declaration of Madhavi and
unity with Romania many people
especially in the south where Ukrainian
or Russian and for them the idea of
joining Romania wasn't so enchanting and
so in the end they didn't after which
Moldova would remain an independent
nation I hope you enjoyed this episode

lobster mac and cheese iron chef bobby
flake even before the food network's
iron chef
there was the french chef welcome to the
french chef
i'm julia child culinary icon julia
child a pioneer in the history of
television we're making the stew of
stews
and a revolutionary in the kitchen
fundamentally disrupting the way
americans viewed and cooked food at home
today we're going to make chocolate cake
and it's a very special
very chocolately
bittersweet lovely cake it was a
wasteland
american food before julia was kind of
pathetic i'm all ready
to make fish julia really introduced
americans to different kinds of food she
had a profound impact on our entire food
culture
well that didn't go very well
now 17 years after her death the life
and legacy of julia child is on full
display in the new mouth-watering
documentary julia
film directing duo julie cohen and my
friend former nightline senior producer
betsy west have profiled some of the
most barrier-breaking women the two
making a name for themselves with their
oscar-nominated documentary rbg we were
looking for another revolutionary
feminist game changer and just like ruth
bader ginsburg julia had a secret weapon
she had her husband backing her every
step of the way what's better than a
husband who's ready to support his woman
in personal life and also in career even
to the point in paul child's case where
his wife has kind of eclipsed him she
married paul child and moved to france
first you need a big soul thick filet
where she had the meal that would change
her life it's absolutely delicate it's
one of the finest things in life
soul munir that first bite igniting her
passion for french cuisine our first
meal in france was just
just a great awakening to me from there
it was off to culinary school at la
cordon blue in paris a discipline
dominated by men
women were treated pretty badly teachers
were all european male chefs
and they'd rather not have women in
their kitchen
most women felt that they couldn't
really have a career making money in
food she was inspired to co-author her
now legendary cookbook mastering the art
of french cooking which has today sold
more than 1.5 million copies
but it's a book that almost didn't
happen finally they complete a draft of
their masterpiece turn it into the
editor the publisher who says uh
no thank you the letter literally says
the american wife might be frightened by
the buy this good book like a cookbook
is going to be frightening in an effort
to spur excitement for the book julia
would alter the course of television i
was a producer director of wgbh the
public television station in the boston
viewing area
she made a proper omelette in a proper
omelette pan that night
and the host was blown away by its
lightness and its taste
and after that was shown they were like
the station got a lot of letters saying
why don't we have a cooking show
the french chef was born you just have
to have the courage of your conviction
there was julia unfiltered and unafraid
to show her bloopers
if she made a mistake she was not
remotely rattled i didn't have the
courage to do it the way i should have
but you can always pick it up and if
you're alone in the kitchen who is going
to see she really was on television as a
middle-aged woman um let's hear it for
middle-aged women
at a time when really women were just
showcases
exactly art pieces
julia was not a particularly remarkable
beauty
she was middle aged with freckles and
her hair changed daily but you were
mesmerized spellbound by what she was
saying she was a groundbreaker defying
the odds and becoming a female
television sensation starting in her 50s
julia never called herself a feminist
although she was clearly really
important to the feminist movement
when i started working with julia we'd
walk into a restaurant to have a meal
then afterwards they'd want to give us a
tour of the kitchen and the first thing
she would say
is
where are all the women how come there's
no women in here she was also unafraid
of controversy because she spoke her
mind when it came to abortion rights she
made the decision to come out very
forcefully as an advocate for planned
parenthood at a time when celebrities
you know celebrity chefs were barely a
thing so that wasn't happening welcome
i am julia charles
it wasn't until she saw the snl skit
that she grasped the magnitude of her
celebrity
now i've done it i've cut the dickens
out of my finger well
i'm glad in a way this happened you know
accidents
julia loved it because she had a good
sense of humor about herself but i think
that a lot of people have that
characterization of julia is kind of you
know loud and a little drunk and you
know kind of crazy woman when pbs tried
to sideline julia after a decade of the
french chef she found a new home in her
80s right here on abc with a new
sidekick dose it with red wine charlie
gibson you're dousing aren't you talking
to charlie was really aghast because he
obviously got such a kick out of working
with julia and he talked about how she
loved to flirt with him and i think he
loved to flirt with her she was the ever
ready bunny she kept going past
everybody else's shelf life what does
that say about her
the thing about julia's longevity on
television she kept getting better
proving yet again that julia was always
the master at shattering expectations

the director of the controversial
documentary called India's daughter has
left India because of concerns for her
safety she's now in London her film
examines the gang rape and murder of a
23-year-old woman on a bus in Delhi the
BBC broadcast it last night other
broadcasters globally are going to do
the same in the days to come and it has
brought a storm of controversy in India
because of comments made by one of the
rapists about his victim here's some of
that as we take a look at an excerpt of
India's
[Music]
daughter there are the incendiary
comments and that is part of the
documentary so Nala AED our reporter is
actually in India in New Delhi and
covering the story for us among other
things on the ground but let's talk
about the the controversy that surrounds
that as I mentioned the BBC broadcast
last night a contentious decision to ER
it tell us a little bit about the film
itself and the
controversy well as you said this is a
documentary that's been long in the
making that takes another look at that
horrific incident about two years ago
where a young woman was gang raped and
uh later died because of her injuries
that essentially was I think many people
here would agree was a watershed moment
for women in this country there's a
great deal of outrage and anger over
that attack and several protests largely
by women were mounted at the time
because U of of what happen and because
of Demands uh for the laws to be changed
now the most contentious aspect is the
one you mentioned and that is the
interview with mukes Singh he is one of
the four men who were convicted and
sentenced to death in fact for their
participation in this attack he was
interviewed a couple of years ago and
now will be appearing or is appearing in
this documentary as you mentioned he has
said things that have outraged people
here in fact around the world he said
that um the victim should not have
fought the rape that perhaps she might
have survived if she hadn't he said that
girls are more responsible for rape than
boys and you can imagine those kinds of
uh commentary have made people quite
angry
here however the fact that the
government has banned this documentary
from
the airwaves here has received a mixed
reaction obviously many people here
concerned about India's reputation and
saying that the documentary perhaps
might Sully that reputation others
though saying that it shouldn't be shown
because the legal process continues in
this case in fact those four men uh have
appealed to the Supreme Court uh for the
death sentence and that procedure is not
over and some feel that legally this man
should not have been allowed to speak
from jail until this legal proceeding is
over so quite a mixed reaction action
here over this documentary and what
about particular reaction because as
you've covered this Nala you have spoken
as well to the family of the young woman
who's right at the heart of this
documentary who was raped and then
murdered what did her family members
say as you can imagine completely
outraged by the interview and and quite
upset by the commentary it is their
daughter who perished in this and um
they they didn't take kindly to those
comments so the mother told us that she
actually went to court when the news
first broke about this document
she lodged a complaint it said that this
should this should never have been
allowed she told us that uh this is his
mentality she's talking about Mr sing
that he has said those kinds of things
in court where he mocked the family and
was laughing while the proceedings were
going on the father told us that this
sort of uh I guess allowance of him
speaking from jail is abusive of the
system but also of all women he said and
he encouraged every single woman um to
oppose it and to go to the Prime
Minister and demand not only to ensure
that they are kept safe but also that
they expedite this um death penalty so
very angry about the commentary here now
thank you very much Nala AED from India
live this morning the documentary banned
in that country but is due to be aired
in Denmark Sweden Switzerland and Norway
as well as this country on this very
Network in fact it airs 1000 p.m. Sunday
which is international women's day
you'll see it on the passionate eye
here's a little bit
more
nobody is a monster that he is excluded
from society after all

[Music]
it's a scandal that has rocked China
voice Eloi one of the Communist Party's
rising political stars is forced from
power Politburo members have been
dismissed before but never in such a
dramatic way Bo's wife is detained as a
suspect in the murder of a British
businessman
we have allegations of corruption
involving potentially hundreds of
millions of dollars it is the biggest
news in China in decades it's like a
Hollywood movie
the downfall of Boyle family has plunged
China into its biggest political crisis
since Tiananmen Square it has disrupted
the Communist Party's carefully-crafted
succession plans created tension with
the UK and us and changed the debate
about the future of the world's second
largest economy Beaujolais is without
doubt the most colorful and charismatic
figure in Chinese politics bullsh t lie
isn't the only top Communist Party
official to fall in recent years but he
is by far the most popular the son of
revolutionary hero boy oh boy he is part
of a group known in China as the
princelings children of senior party
officials who often use their political
connections to advance their careers but
not the only members of the country's
ruling class the princelings are an
influential force in Chinese politics
thanks to years spent rubbing shoulders
with powerful figures but ball wasn't
just politically connected he also knew
how to communicate with people
particularly those who felt left behind
or taken advantage of in the country's
dizzying rush to accumulate wealth more
than any other politician he PE appealed
directly to the masses he had a keen
insight into the anger and resentment of
ordinary people in this country well his
first big job in government came when
the party appointed him mayor of the
polluted industrial city of Dalian in
China's northeast in a pattern he would
later repeat for imposed his will on the
city transforming it into a gleaming
metropolis by courting investment and
spending heavily on public works D felt
beautiful squares he had all the main
buildings in the in the town centre
redone success in Dalian propelled bore
to a job as governor of Liaoning
province and from there to Beijing where
he was named Commerce Minister he seemed
well on his way to a coveted position in
the Politburo Standing Committee the
country's highest decision-making body
but then his career hit a wall the hard
driving style that had served him so
well in the northeast was not
appreciated in the capital and he was
diverted to the southwestern city of
Chongqing
very deep in the countries
less-developed interior Theatron are on
a lot of toes particularly the commerce
ministry both within that ministry and
other people are involved in foreign
trade didn't like the way he worked he
was deemed not to show sufficient
respect to other leaders and their and
their interests he didn't seem to care
he was very unpopular among his peers in
Beijing that's one of the reasons why he
was packed off to - to Chongqing he was
supposed to go to Chongqing and do a
good job be quiet
but his head down work hard for the
development of the West in fact he went
there and he made a big noise
[Music]
Chongqing is a mountainous mega city of
30 million people located on the eastern
edge of Sichuan province despite its
size for years it was seen as a
backwater too far from Beijing and the
city's wealthy coasts to merit much
attention boy arrived in 2007 and just
as in Dalian he set out to remake the
city combining populist campaigns with
massive investment in public works
projects he transformed Chongqing into a
political and economic powerhouse last
year Chongqing GDP grew sixteen point
four percent which made it the fastest
growing region in the entire China what
really drove the growth is very heavy
state government spending on projects
like roads railways big infrastructure
projects and also big spending on
low-cost
social housing projects before long
people in China began talking about a
Chongqing model a blueprint for
development the next heavy state
economic intervention with a revival of
Mao era Communist values among boys
biggest moves a resurrection of the
tradition of so-called red songs he was
looking for a way to try and sort of
regenerates mass public support for the
party and and he decided that this was
this was the way to do it so what he was
doing was organizing these mass
renditions and stadiums and trying to
get every community every state-owned
enterprise was encouraged to organize
these things on various different levels
even even sent troops of red singers up
to Beijing into other cities to do these
performances so he sort of repackaged
the whole thing and made it his own and
then sort of sold it to the entire
nation as his idea
people who painted the city red there
were red songs that were red banners
people said red was the color of
revolution they also said red was the
color of blood there was more than
little violence in Bauchi lies Chongqing
much of that violence was the result of
a crackdown on organized crime under the
auspices of the crackdown hundreds of
gang members policemen government
officials and businessman were arrested
and in some cases executed he made a
really big deal of it he had a lot of
national media attention and arrested a
lot of prominent people and even
including a cm very senior police
official who we subsequently put to
death it had resonance across the
country where people are afraid about
the the the resurgence of gangs black
societies he took them on but he took
them on in such a way that he trampled
over the rule of law there were
allegations of corruption extrajudicial
judicial detentions and so on and so
forth
laws policies made him something of a
hero to intellectuals and officials who
believe the state should take a bigger
role in managing the economy in society
but others watched his rise in Chongqing
with a sense of trepidation what he had
been doing in Trentino remind many
people of the Cultural Revolution people
don't want to go back to those sad days
top figures in the Communist Party were
also put off by his ambition as a
Leninist party as a discipline party
your policy comes from above you
implement policy you don't sell for
grand eyes you don't come across as
being naked lis ambitious if you want to
be ambitious if you want to climb you do
it all behind closed doors he didn't he
did it out there on the stage in full
view of the public and full view of
Beijing deliberately so nearly as big a
threat to the party's legitimacy was the
lavish lifestyle of Bohr's son Bohr guau
guau which true unwanted attention to
the comforts enjoyed by party leaders
like many children of the Chinese elite
bagua attended schools overseas
including Oxford and Harvard but what's
unusual about pork requires that he kept
a very high profile particular when he
was at Oxford he was attending and
organizing a lot of part
there were photographs of him that
appeared on the internet sometimes in
the tuxedo one occasion bare-chested
and that really stirred quite a bit of
controversy and in China because they
just you know focused attention on the
fact that he was studying overseas at
this very prestigious university and
that raised the question well you know
how could he love this how did he get in
but it also sort of broker and under an
unwritten rule amongst leaders that it's
okay to send your kids overseas to study
but you have to maintain a very low
profile writing to the Harvard Crimson
bagua said his education was funded by
scholarships earned independently and by
his mother's savings from her work as a
lawyer and writer despite it all boys
opponents of Beijing were seemingly
powerless to control him
that is until February 6th when
Chongqing Zechs Chief of Police Wang Li
Jordan once a top four ally ran to the
US consulate in nearby Chengdu with
stories of intrigue and murder and
sought protection there the event
triggered what would become China's
biggest political crisis in a generation
[Music]
one Legion had a reputation as being one
of the toughest policemen in China and
in Chongqing he'd been the guy who
really oversaw fossilised campaign
against organized crime and he earned
ass of nationwide reputation he was a
martial arts expert and so there's a lot
of media attention focused on him and
we've since learned that he obviously
fell out with boss July and that's why
he decided to seek refuge in the US
consulate
ballin Wang fell out over a central
government investigation into
allegations of abuse of power stemming
from the Chongqing organized crime
crackdown after both fired long as
police chief in early February
Wang began to fear that he would be made
to take the fall for boy and hastily
arranged a meeting of the US consulate
once he was safely inside long requested
asylum but the u.s. turned him down
facing capture by forces loyal to poor
Wang reached out to authorities in
Beijing instead Obama administration
officials briefed on the matter say that
there was little reason to shelter Wang
on Human Rights grounds and that he was
never a serious candidate for asylum
US officials maintain that in turning
over to central authorities they were
guarding his safety with his top
lieutenant gone oil was suddenly
vulnerable many began to openly
speculate about his political future at
the annual meeting of China's Parliament
in March bull remained defiant accusing
his critics of pouring filth on him and
his family but it was too late days
later in a separate press conference
premier Wen Jiabao ordered chome team's
leaders to reflect on their mistakes
ball was stripped of his position as
communist party secretary in Chongqing
the next day into news early
truth be heat fans being Lyndon -
manager Wang leader Xi and own shishito
shoes would ball clearly in trouble
allegations about events Incheon team
began to flow freely the most shocking
of those revolved around Neil Heywood a
British businessman
the controversy over Bo Xilai and the
suspicious circumstances of neil Hayes
was a really serious charge for a senior
political leaders a white businessman
Neil Heywood in China has continued to
put pressure on the British government
Neil Heywood was a British business
consultant who came out to China in the
early to mid 1990s he studied Chinese
for bet in Beijing and then moved up to
the northeastern city of Dalian and he
got to know boss Eli after writing to
him directly to ask if he could help in
attracting foreign investment to the
city and if war could help him Haywood
was what is known as a fixer expats who
exploit their connections in China to
help broker deals for foreign companies
he really seemed to cultivate a bit of
an air of mystery he played up to the
stereotype of the the British gentleman
overseas he liked to wear as a cream
linen suits he drove his Jaguar with
double-oh-seven and the number plate and
of course for business purposes he
needed to play up his his links to you
know powerful people in China after a
few years in Dahlia Haywood became a
part of the boy family's inner circle
developing a close relationship with
Bo's wife Gu Kailai after helping to
arrange for her son to study in Britain
well at some point the relationship with
gu Kailai
starts to deteriorate it's not clear
exactly when she believed that somebody
in that inner circle of friends and
advisors had betrayed her and around
that time Hayward starts to become
concerned about the fallout from this
this relationship his fears mounting
Haywood confided in a friend that he had
left documents detailing the bore
families overseas investments with a
lawyer in Britain as an insurance policy
then in November he was summoned to a
meeting in Chongqing Heywood's body was
reportedly found at the Nanshan holiday
lijiang hotel local authorities quickly
blamed his death on alcohol abuse and
cremated his remains
it took the British government three
months to request a formal investigation
the brief government has faced a
pressure from British press and
politicians about why
didn't respond earlier by the British
government's own admission they knew as
early as mid-january that there were
suspicions in the local expat community
about nil Hayward's death and as The
Wall Street Journal has reported there
were some British consular officials in
China who were concerned in even in the
immediate aftermath in November of mr.
Heywood's death for its part though the
UK government has repeatedly said it
initially didn't have any cause for
concern what prompted the UK to request
the investigation was Wong Lee Joon's
flight to the US consulate and what
officials there said Wong had told them
that he'd fallen out with borer after
telling his boss he believed Heywood had
been poisoned and that Haywood and gu
Kailai had been involved in some kind of
business dispute and at that point there
was a sort of cascade of revelations
about Haywood's connections to the poor
family which ultimately led to another
official announcement this time that
borsch ally had been dismissed from the
Politburo and the Central Committee and
was under investigation and then there
was a second announcement on the same
day that gu Kailai his wife was in
custody as a suspect in the murder of
Neil Heywood
the ultimate fate of boss Eli and his
wife remains unclear while bull is still
celebrated by many in Chongqing he and
gu Kailai have been criticized obliquely
in the state-run press and thoroughly
demonized in chatter on the chinese
internet the two have not appeared in
public since March and have been unable
to respond to the accusations against
them authorities launched an
investigation into chantings economy
that has cast serious doubts on the
Chongqing model with the Communist Party
getting ready to hand over power to a
new generation of leaders in the fall
those doubts have tilted the debate
about the country's future direction
just give you a figure between 2004 and
2010 Johnson built more than 50,000
miles of roads but having so much
interventioning the society that the
bigger problem is can the government
really afford the spending it has taken
on billions tens the billions of dollars
of debt this could really affect the
doctrinal direction that the party takes
because boss Eli really represented a
certain style of government and a model
of development for China over the next
ten years the voices within the party
who have been arguing for fewer fewer
restrictions on the private sector on
civil society and a greater role for the
rule of law they might find that there
they're in the ascendancy now but the
big question is whether they use this
opportunity then to actually really ant
enact the kind of reforms that they've
been advocating over the last few years
that uncertainty has led to concerns
beyond China's borders as the rest of
the world tries to understand what Bo's
fall means for their dealings with the
rising power with the rising popularity
of social media in China the impact of
boors case has been amplified even more
this is the biggest political scandal in
China for more than two decades and two
two decades ago there was no internet in
China Chinese people have never had such
freedom was such a tool we can use to
talk about political affairs
now that possibly it's most delicate
moment the Communist Party faces a
wrenching dilemma stay silent on the
details surrounding Bora and risk
angering and increasingly plugged-in
populist or expose the results of the
investigation and risk a potentially
fatal blow to the party's credibility
for The Wall Street Journal this is Josh

Pakistan and this community
Reem helped lumna file a government
application for housing support
there are many needy people like me look

first the government should provide us
with accommodation because a transgender
person's biggest worry is a place to
live
[Music]
a few transgender people have access to
government support many live off the
money that they are given on the street
here day by day they are exposed to
people's reactions like
there are good and bad people most of
them are bad there are fewer good people
we get a lot of questions someone will
say why are you doing this
we say to them we're humans like you if
we were valued as much as you we
wouldn't be begging
transgender women also work as dancers
and sex workers for many it's the only
way to earn money labor for which they
are condemned
sometimes a human mind comes under
satanic influence so transgender women
fall victim to lust they get murdered
they get invited to different parties
and then get murdered in Cold Blood
I know this from the newspapers
[Music]
not disabled then people's behavior
could be even worse than this there are
still good people in this market who
don't utter bad words otherwise in
crowds people grope us or do nasty
things
the problem is that if you kill a dog on
this side and on the other side you kill
a transgender person the transgender
person has no value but the dog does
she's also a human with two eyes hands
and feet a nose and a mouth she talks
like us why are we segregating them I
think they are like us
they are underprivileged in our society

given jobs

in Karachi a city in southern Pakistan
the women of the World Festival is
taking place it includes a panel
discussion where Reem and other
representatives of the transgender
Community discuss the current situation
conservative parties are trying to
overturn the law on transgender rights
the Senators think that this transgender
person's protection of Rights Act is not
under jurisdiction of Islam according to
them only intersex persons are the
transgender persons and then they think
that these transgender persons are the
source of sin they are badly misinformed
this legislation is all about basic
human rights
[Music]
even if the first steps for their rights
have been taken transgender people in
Pakistan are not free to choose their
gender they are marked as X
what is this ex giving to us no
privilege we cannot get married
and that is something which is very
close to my heart I am alone
because just because of my
reality
I am happy to be here although I feel
these men are cowards so
um they will not accept us
you know but forcefully they will
so we have you know that kind of stick
in our hand to to to make our visibility
strong to make to to make our acceptance
accepted
[Music]
we transgender woman expect from the

Late Timmy Tope Bal Bal hey you are not

Prophet T
Joshua H it says that the in a statement

so there yeah so you are stuck with me
subscribe to the channel how do you not
subscribe to
such
subscribe to the L
privilege don't take yourself too
serious my friend calm down they say
this part I want you guys to see this
part this is very important okay based
on everything that we saw on that
documentary this statement is very
important it is signed by the
public this is important
describing it it as baseless
highlighting that the individuals
interviewed in the report were not
affiliated with the
church call me
delusion we saw footage of this people
coming the first time you know when
these people leave of course you know
they they took their videos you know or
they kind of captured their videos and
to see their
childhood we saw video
footage this is what happens when you
when you respond without seeing what we
saw so to go on saying that in a
statement signed by the public a Affairs
director scone faulted the broadcast
station and its documentary described it
as baseless and highlighting that the
individuals interviewed in the report
were not affiliated with the church
that's very interesting because those
mandms showed us proof that they were
there what's this um games that yall
like
playing who wrote this did they even
watch the
documentary we have
footage we have footage you know this
this is this is how polit this is how
politicians speak when they speak to the
masses you see
they they take you for a dum
D you see me I don't I'm not a fan of
being taken like a dum
D
okay so to say that the
individuals not affiliated to the
church okay nther news understand that
the church's intention in issuing the
statement was to clarify any
misconceptions that
may arise from the documentary which has
generated mixed reactions in Christendom
and among concerned Nigerian and
authorities I
guess definitely it should okay it is
worthy to note that the docu the BBC
documentary which was released on Monday
made news headlines and serious
allegations against
TV including accusation of mandms mandam
you understand we can't say those words
on these
platforms of some members okay so now by
the way you not some members these
people spoke about themselves don't say
members when you say me who wrote the
statement man who wrote the statement
public relations man wow going man why
are
going I mean like if you're in Public
Relation like you can't use loose
words or is it just me you can't lose
you can't use loose words like that oh
yeah yeah members no no no we're not
talking about members these people spoke
about themselves accusations
of members no it's not accusation of me
these people were talking about
themselves
so putting it as M but again okay we've
been take they're talking like
politicians note go back in that
statement it says that
however however scone has said that the
BBC investigative unit okay H and wat
the organ the people that do the the
investigation and them kind of things
came out this week with a weird and a
strange episode epe on the hey English
don't kill me oh autocracy against the
late founder okay and the church
emphasized H that the investigation was
carried out in a manner that deviated
from the ethics and found H you're using
English for nothing English for
nothing people
when
English ethics and Foundation of
principle and of Journalism M okay so
they conducted the investigations they
found people who had been speaking some
of these people had been speaking for
more than 10 years without the BBC so
when people come out here and claim oh
they were paid what money was bisa paid
she's been speaking for over 10 years
Paul he been speaking for how long what
money was mandam paid y are funny out
here I don't know if they think
this sometimes I think people actually
think we are
kids we not be kids as per the church
perspective journalist H being a a
watchdog hey necessitates the practice
of fairness and balance you were asked
for your comment you said you don't want
to comment because these things that's
why at the end the documentary they ask
they they stated
there we ask for the statement they
didn't
give for balance so now we are teaching
journalism now okay now we have been
taught what journalism should be okay
compromise fictional okay they're going
on about what journalist should do
interesting this is the L we're not even
going to read that part because they're
trying to teach us what journalism
should be doing according to the church
there are numerous individuals who have
experienced astonishing Miracles and
greatly benefited from the anointing and
the grace bestowed
upon upon them by the Lord
through whatever that is all about what
you talking about and it says that this
benefit when we are talking
about let's get out of the
statement
let's get it let's get this straight
here if there is accusations and your
way of handling the accusations that are
at hand is to come out and tell us about
the Miracles it means that you're using
the
Miracles and the giftings as a way of
shrouding whatever questions come that
that's that's a very that's a huge red
flag like I was not there okay it's
between it's between the
victims God and the man them
involved we are just reporting but for
me as a person who's supposed to be
looking and saying do I believe this I
doubt it when you now bring in subject
of Miracles okay if you now bring in
subject of Miracles what does Miracles
have to do with what we are talking
about when you bring in Miracles it
means that you use those things you use
gifting you use taking money giving to
the widows I took money I G so you you
have never read the verse that says if
you even if you bent your hand but if
you lack love it is as good as nothing
you've never read that
verse you know the
read wake up like this statement it's
such a it
said the first part of it it the first
part that's where the disrespect comes
in for me the disrespect starts right in
the first statement when they state that
you know what scone faulted at the
broadcast and station and its
documentary describing it as baseless in
in highlighting that the individuals
that were not affiliated with the church
that for me it's concerning
because that's a constitute that's
that's how you brainwash
people you see you brainwash people by
when they have seen something you try to
tell no no you didn't see anything you
know left hand you know the left
hand focus on the left hand there's
nothing over there's nothing anywhere
else focus on the left hand that's what
they are doing they playing tricks on
people you saw what you saw but they are
not AFF affiliated with the church yes
they are not right right now affiliated
with the church but they were in the
church so you're not you are telling us
something that it's contrary that's not
the topic whether they are now in the
church it would be funny if they were
still in the church isn't
it so the statement that we read
here from my perspective it's no
statement at
all it's no statement at all because all
it says is that there is a lord you know
you can do you know can start believing
your own life you can lie to people to a
point where you start believing your own
life this is questionable Behavior how
why tell us that these people are not
associated when we saw
footage so if you keep playing Left
Hand left
hand these are tricks it's how you
brainwash a person no no no you didn't
see that no you didn't see that as a
matter of fact there is no hand that's
moving I don't know what you're talking
about there is no hand that's
moving if you don't get it you don't get
it okay why say contrary to what we
saw why tell us oh yeah they said that
members
were no they didn't say members wa by
making it members some you're making it
vague
that's a very PR stand that's guys
please you
guys to be a is
difficult to be
a to be a chatan is difficult it's hard
work a statement that it's literally the
left hand left left hand no hand is
moving here and if you don't get what I
mean is that they are play Playing
Tricks on what you saw it's the very
same thing you see in the Bible when
Blan betas experiences a miracle and
they ask him so you say you got him what
do you say about him of course he's
going to say I was healed by by Jesus
but the question is not whether you got
the miracle the question is can you
change what you claim to have been to
have known as
truth that's the challenge so it's quite
interesting see this particular
statement here but yall tell me what you
think it's reality show with do daily
Christian commentary videos I it had me
confused I like I saw what I saw why are
you telling me I didn't see anything
pretty much confusing you tell me what
you think tricky see you and the next
episode other episodes done today done

mommy dead and dearest released by HBO
mommy dead and dearest Chronicles the
events that led to Dede Blanchard's
death the truth is
I did actually
it details how she committed factitious
disorder imposed on another or what was
once known as Munchausen Syndrome by
proxy on her daughter Gypsy Rose
Blanchard essentially made it seem like
her daughter suffered from a number of
terrible ailments while upholding the
LIE the mother put her child through
unnecessary surgeries and other Terrible
Things Gypsy Rose then conspired with
her boyfriend Nicholas godijan to kill
Blanchard it's unsettling to think of
the horrors that pushed a daughter to
slay her own mother no matter how you
view it mommy dead and dearest makes for
one creepy viewing experience I think
playing with myself and I blame other
people but I never once playing Beyond
number 19 tabloid back in September of
1977 Mormon missionary Kirk Anderson was
supposedly abducted and abused by a
woman named Joyce McKinney the story
became known as the manacled Mormon case
she said to him she was going to go on
having sex with him until she found she
missed a period
and would then hopefully be pregnant by
him this terrifying story was
extensively covered in the British
tabloids specifically the warring Rivals
Daily Express and Daily Mirror the
documentary tabloid conveys these events
with unnerving detail and is even
narrated by Joyce McKinney herself that
shocking Choice immediately brings
viewers closer to the case than they
expected as a result those watching will
further question the story that she
weaves because it has multiple
viewpoints and perspectives I made
everything that he wanted I was like his
little you know
laffy almost number 18 there's something
wrong with Aunt Diane this troubling
documentary tells the story of the 2009
Taconic State Parkway crash a nasty
traffic collision that resulted in eight
deaths it was a horrific scene on a
Taconic Park where I near Route 117 this
afternoon this burned out shell was all
that remained of a minivan after the
head on Crash which left eight people
dead it was caused by a woman named
Diane Schuler the titular Aunt Diane on
that fateful day she was the one
traveling on the Parkway in the wrong
direction it's a very disconcerting
story that is rooted in unimaginable
tragedy throughout the documentary
upsetting questions are raised about
Schuler's State of Mind between footage
of the accident interviews with grieving
individuals and some rather
uncomfortable topics there's something
wrong with Aunt Diane puts forth a very
uneasy atmosphere I feel like someone's
gonna say 10 years later it proves what
happened
there's so much more to the story number
17 team foxcatcher the story of John
Dupont was famously captured in the 2014
film Fox catcher which earned five Oscar
nominations you have a problem with me
John I don't have a problem
team foxcatcher was released two years
later and serves as an eerie companion
piece retelling the story with a more
grounded and arguably more disturbing
angle this Netflix documentary uses
harrowing archival footage to tell its
story viewers are also given a rather
personal and alarming glimpse into the
mind of a killer by incorporating all
these details viewers get a sense of
what led to DuPont's horrifying actions
the documentary explores how mental
illness wealth and power can create a
nightmarish situation Dave Schultz was
the truest friend John had
number 16 room 237 The Shining is one of
the most elusive films of all time
inviting endless interpretations and
reading since its release in 1980 room
237 honors the movie's Legacy and
examines some of the most profound and
intriguing readings but it looks like
he's
it looks like he's a giant like
clearing the clearing the forest topics
like American imperialism Greek
mythology and the Holocaust are explored
in depth the famous conspiracy that
Stanley Kubrick helped fake the moon
landing is also covered room 237
ultimately stands as a spooky complex
and endlessly riveting glimpse into the
granddaddy of all horror films its
off-putting interpretations proved to be
nearly as frightening as the movie
itself this is an impossible window it's
not it is impossible that it is
physically impossible it cannot be there
it should not be there there's no place
in the hotel for this window to exist
number 15 this is the Zodiac speaking
much has been written about the Zodiac
killings get on your stomach so I can
tell your feet okay
it gets really cold out here at night we
could freeze
at this point the case is among the most
discussed serial tragedies in American
history this is the Zodiac speaking is
one of the most definitive documentaries
about the case it contains interviews
with retired police officers and
criminal profilers their first-hand
accounts of the case give viewers
unfettered access into the distressing
story that has captivated Americans and
True Crime enthusiasts for decades the
disturbing Story covers how zodiac
targeted innocent people and flippantly
discussed his crimes all the interviews
in the documentary play on his notoriety
seeing the impact the cases had on
people's psyches is arguably even
scarier than the story itself I would
say the paranoia Indonesia lasted a good
six to seven months
people were very concerned and it
escalated every time after another
reported killing number 14 the killing
of America released in 1982 the killing
of America argues that the United States
is in the midst of a messy cultural
collapse the title has both metaphorical
and literal layers to it much of the
film is centered around the incredible
wave of violence that struck America in
the 60s and 70s a few weeks after the
assassination of President Kennedy the
murder rate exploded upward tripled in
just 10 years
and continues to the present day this
includes the assassination of John and
Robert Kennedy the rise of serial
killers and a very distressing shooting
it's a shocking documentary that leaves
viewers feeling extremely uncomfortable
featuring genuine footage of violence
and interviews with the likes of
criminals like Sirhan Sirhan and Ed
Kemper the killing of America makes for
one distressing watch new breed of
killer appeared
they didn't want money or sex or Revenge
it was a new kind of murder
the senseless killing of random
strangers number 13 the cannibal that
walked free having aired on the British
station channel 5 the cannibal that
walked free is a nightmarish glimpse
into one of Humanity's darkest crimes
through the lens of Japanese criminal
issei sagawa it explores the psychology
behind cannibalism 26 years ago Mr
murdered and at a woman in Paris he is
never so trial
today he walks the Tokyo streets a free
man in June of 1981 sagawa killed and
desecrated a student named Renee
hartevelt but he was allowed to walk
free thanks to a legal snafu between
France and Japan this documentary delves
into sagawa's crimes and the psychology
behind his actions through interviews
with sagawa himself seeing this
perturbing story get conveyed through
the lens of the perpetrator can be skin
crawling for many it may prove too much
to bear you see the beautiful goals on
the train in the summer and you see
their legs don't you I think they look
delicious that much is true number 12.
Wisconsin death trip based on a
non-fiction book of the same name
Wisconsin death trip is a Sinister
docudrama about a turbulent time in
Wisconsin history the story follows a
series of disturbing occurrences that
plagued the state in the late 19th
century grave of Mrs Sarah Smith was
Unearthed for the purpose of removing
the remains
and upon opening the coffin
it was discovered that she'd been buried
while in a trance this includes the
abandoning of children homicides arson
and Supernatural delusion as if the
subject matter wasn't troubling enough
the docudrama is also shot in silent
black and white to convey the style of
old movies the Aged cinematography
immediately puts viewers on edge
meanwhile the Contemporary newspaper
accounts are chillingly narrated by Ian
Holm the combined effect is one of deep
and uncomfortable surrealism we can say
honestly but we know of few states or
cities which offer the advantages of
those enjoyed by Wisconsin and Black
River Falls number 11. Eileen warnos the
selling of a serial killer Eileen warnos
was a sex worker who killed seven
clients between 1989 and 1990. two years
later Nick Broomfield made a documentary
most of the film is centered around
broomfield's attempts at conducting an
interview with warnos in prison I was
doing fine until Tara told me start
going to see strangers and make more
money that's how I wound up in the
situation as she discusses the case
viewers witnessed the troubling defense
that she put forth and the implications
that it represented the interviews with
warnos are also bone Shilling it's clear
that her life was full of extensive pain
and suffering at every stage years later
the documentary became an enormous
inspiration for Charlize Theron who
would later win an Oscar for playing
warnos in Monster hey I don't need a rut
because I want to take a car number 10.
The Imposter it gives you nightmares
it really does in 1994 13 year old
Nicholas Barkley disappeared in Texas
three years later a man claiming to be
Nicholas came forward but this man
wasn't Nicholas at all he was Frederick
Bordeaux a French con artist The
Imposter explains how Bordeaux was able
to get away with it for so long despite
being significantly older than Nicholas
and not looking anything like him it's
incredibly disturbing how Bordeaux
inserted himself into the Barkley family
and tricked them into accepting him most
remarkable of all however is the
director Bart Layton conducted
interviews with bordon himself which
makes the case even more complex as he
somehow manages to come across as
sympathetic from as long as I remember
I wanted to be someone else number nine
cropsy growing up on Staten Island
Barbara and I had often heard the legend
of cropsy
for the kids in our neighborhood cropsy
was the Escape mental patient who lived
in the tunnels beneath the old abandoned
Willowbrook mental institution a pair of
filmmakers who grew up on Staten Island
decided to take a closer look at the New
York version of The Boogeyman cropsy and
how or if this urban legend fits into
the Mysteries involving a series of
kidnapped children in the 70s and 80s
when your child disappears
and you don't know
where that child is to a parent the
child is never dead from the letters
Prime Suspect Andre Rand sends the
documentarians claiming his innocence to
investigating the tunnels underneath the
condemned Willowbrook state school for
people with neurodevelopmental
disabilities and finally theories about
devil worshipers cropsy is sure to send
a chill down your spine is there satanic
Cults people that practice of course
there is
but it's something that's kept very
quiet something that uh not many
departments investigate number eight the
bridge so then I cut over just to see or
maybe possibly help the Golden Gate
Bridge may be one of America's most
iconic landmarks and the image that
comes to mind when you think of the city
of San Francisco but for many its
looming presence is a symbol of tragedy
this documentary takes a closer look at
some of these tragic incidents in 2004
but it certainly isn't easy viewing it
remains controversial with reports of
bridge jumpers increasing after the
documentary was released and in 2015 it
was even removed from Netflix in New
Zealand Gene had people in this world
that loved him
and he heard them
if I see him again that's what I want to
tell he heard me and I didn't think you
would ever do that number seven holy
hell I thought I was capturing life and
expressing love while searching for a
new home and a new purpose in the 1980s
film grad will Allen fell in with the
buddhafield new religious movement a
cult based in West Hollywood at the time
it was all designed to show how devoted
you really were he wanted to control the
social lives the interactions of
everybody what they did Allen became the
group's documentarian and lived with
them for 22 years finally leaving in
2007. he became inspired to make a movie
and used all the footage he had of his
time with the buddhafield cult and its
leader Michelle to create holy hell this
direct look at the inner workings of
occult is both rare and creepy made all
the more unsettling by the fact that the
cult continues to this day now based in
Hawaii even to this day I just I don't
understand
some people still stayed number six the
family I had originally intended to
examine juvenile criminals in the U.S
this documentary quickly shifted to
focus on the personal tragedy faced by
charity Lee in February 2007 involving
her young daughter she was
in a body bag
it follows charity as she grapples with
the reality of her son having killed her
daughter as she Mourns Ella's loss but
refuses to abandon Paris still visiting
him in prison it's difficult to know
what to make of this uncomfortable watch
as the film leans into the fact that
with True Crime there are no easy
answers I try
to keep everything as
benign as possible
I don't want to do anything that's going
to make Paris want to hurt him number
five titicate Follies
[Music]
one of the most disturbing films ever
made titicate Follies was banned for
over 20 years upon release shot in black
and white with no narration it's a raw
expose of the injustices that Americans
with mental health issues faced in the
1960s specifically centered on the
Bridgewater State Hospital in
Massachusetts the film shows the gross
mistreatment of the inmates all people
in need of real care who were
dehumanized and abused by those tasked
with looking after them if I see enough
Improvement in you but how can I improve
if I'm getting worse I'm trying to tell
you day by day I am getting worse
because of the circumstances because of
the situation despite being banned the
film was able to draw attention to these
issues though it still took decades for
this to begin whatever since you're
created by the use of your sense of
touch
number four Jesus Camp listen
we hold the keys
we can change the world this look at a
summer camp for one branch of
Evangelical Christians has been
disturbing viewers around the world
since its initial release seen by many
as a damning portrayal of allegedly
abusive practices at camps like the
featured kids on fire School of ministry
it played a role in getting the camp
shut down father we just washed them
with the water of your word we say no
more devil no more the camp Pastor Becky
Fisher was forced to close the retreat
due to backlash but it's arguably a
credit to the directors that you can't
necessarily tell where their own
sympathies lie while watching this movie
it's down to the viewer to decide what's
right and what's wrong you could call it
brainwashing but I am radical and
passionate in teaching children about
their responsibility number three dear
Zachary a letter to a son about his
father I called back to the Sunnyvale
Police Station so he gave me another
number and then I got through to
Sergeant Cruella and he said your son is
dead under suspicious circumstances have
you got any idea why he was in the park
a hair Wing watch dear Zachary follows
Kurt Kenny as he makes a movie about
Andrew Bagby his lifelong friend who was
allegedly murdered by his ex Shirley
Jane Turner Turner revealed shortly
after Andrew's death that she was
pregnant with their child but police had
a difficult time pinning the murder on
her I have to tell you that Andrew is
dead are you sure yes ma'am I am I'm
absolutely sure the movie is intended as
an archive of Andrew a widely loved
person by all accounts for his son
Zachary but the project became more
complex the longer it went on and by the
time it was finished it had become a
fully fledged documentary an examination
of loss and grief dear Zachary is as
poignant as it is upsetting this film
was no longer a letter to you
it was now a letter to someone else
number two the Act of Killing
foreign
with subject matter this heavy The Act
of Killing was always going to be a
tough watch in Indonesia filmmaker
Joshua Oppenheimer interviews former
executioners who took part in the
Indonesian mass killings of
1965-66. they reenact the killings in a
variety of genres including westerns and
musicals while Oppenheimer asks them
both about their artistic choices in the
portrayals and about the events
themselves the fun reenactments
juxtaposed with the horrific topics they
portray is extremely disturbing it's not
hard to see why this documentary remains
so controversial

number one abducted in plain sight she
looked up at me her eyes baby
and I knew that I had found a little
girl
that I was searching for Jan broberg's
story is particularly disturbing when
she was just an adolescent in the 1970s
one of the broberg family's neighbors
Robert Birch told befriended Jen's
parents and inserted himself into their
lives twice Birch told abducted Jan
including taking her to Mexico his
manipulation knew no bounds even after
Jan was brought home the first time her
parents still allowed Birch toll to be
around her even letting him sleep in her
bed I don't think I can ever really
forgive myself for letting that happen
by far the strangest detail is the
recordings Birch told made of aliens to
further increase his influence on Jan
thankfully Jan and her family survived
the long ordeal and I immediately
thought I'd been kidnapped by a UFO

in the early hours of august 19 1919 a
handful of small british torpedo boats
snuck into kronstadt the most heavily
defended naval base in the world they
launched a daring attack on the russian
baltic fleet inside its own harbor
determined to bolshevik sea
power and help to secure the
independence of the baltic states
though the armistice of november 1918
brought the first world war to an end in
the territories of the former russian
empire fighting still raged a brutal
civil war had broken out between the
bolsheviks and their
counter-revolutionary opponents known as
the white russians
the victorious allies were not as it
turned out big fans of bolshevism and
from 1918 they intervened to support
their opponents
after the end of hostilities with
germany britain expanded its
intervention to the baltic sea
a naval task force was sent to help
strengthen the populations of that part
of the world against bolshevism and to
assist britain's interests in the baltic
principally this meant supporting the
newly independent nations of estonia and
latvia which were threatened by a red
army that was every bit as imperialist
as the tsarist one that had gone before
the british squadron under rear admiral
walter cowan from january 1919 did what
it could to help though with no plans
for british land troops to be dispatched
this help was mostly limited to the
supply of arms and occasional naval
gunfire support
cowen's ships were the only major naval
force initially but as winter turned to
spring the sea ice in the gulf of
finland began to melt threatening to
unleash a serious threat in the shape of
the russian baltic fleet
under the control of the bolsheviks and
operating from the heavily defended
fortress of kronstadt were three
battleships two cruisers eight
destroyers and five submarines
with the battleships wielding 12-inch
guns they had a clear superiority over
cowan's force of light cruisers and
destroyers and alarm bells began to ring
when bolshevik ships skirmished with
their british counterparts on may 17th
luckily for rear admiral cowan help was
on the way in the shape of six men and a
couple of speed boats
at the start of 1919 augustus wellington
shelton agar was a 29 year old royal
navy lieutenant with nothing to do
he had served during the war supporting
supplies to russia and later in motor
torpedo boats these two experiences made
him an ideal candidate for a rather more
low publicity deployment of the baltic
in february agar was recruited by
britain's secret intelligence service to
lead a detachment of two coastal motor
boats at the small finnish town of
teriyaki these small craft could move
quickly and stealthy through russian
minefields making them ideal for running
spies to and from petrograd undetected
this task alone was not enough for agar
though who saw an opportunity to take a
rather more active role in the conflict
his boats were capable of carrying a
single torpedo on their stern and
lieutenant agar saw that it might be
possible to ambush an unsuspecting
bolshevik ship inside their protective
minefields where larger british ships
and submarines could not venture
such an attack was not actually within
the remit of agar's orders but he didn't
let that deter him persuading rear
admiral cowan to provide him with two
torpedoes shortly after arriving
in the middle of june agar got a chance
to test out his idea when the russian
fortress at krasnaya gorka rebelled
against the bolsheviks and was soon
under bombardment by heavy units of the
red fleet
on the night of june 17th agar took cmb7
over to the russian ships crept in a few
hundred yards of the cruiser oleg and
began an attack
because of the way the torpedo was
mounted on the boat this was a fraught
business agar had to accelerate the top
speed fire the torpedo off the back of
the boat and then turn hard to get out
of its way
managing to accomplish this the torpedo
slammed into the olex hull underneath
the fordmost funnel caught in the
cruiser to sink steadily into the gulf
of finland as agar and his crew crapped
away into the night
when news emerged of gas raid rear
admiral cowan was delighted at the
initiative even though it had taken
place without his orders
cowan was so impressed in fact he
decided to see if it could be replicated
on a larger scale he secured more
coastal motorboats from the admiralty
and positioned them at bjorko which was
being used as a forward base for
britain's naval forces in the area
these were larger craft and agars
carrying two torpedoes each with the
fertilla led by commander claude dobson
calvin was also reinforced at about the
same time by the aircraft carrier hms
vindictive which provided an air wing to
the british forces in the baltic for the
first time
before these aircraft had a chance to be
put to use though the ship was dealing
with a tragedy
on the morning of july 22nd while the
ship was at hands to bathing stations
leading aircraftman charles henry
england got into trouble and drowned
while swimming
he was buried the following day in the
town of koivisto and he also happened to
be my great's great uncle which brings

sponsoring this video with aircraft and
a flotilla of speed boats at his
disposal walter cowan now hatched an
incredibly bold plan
drawing inspiration from roger keys his
raid on z ruger the previous year which
left hadn't agar had taken part in he
outlined operation rk
the plan was for a mass torpedo boat
attack inside kronstadt harbour aiming
to destroy or damage as much of the red
fleet as possible
this was no small feat kronstadt was
protected by more than 20 individual
forts as well as extensive shore
batteries to aid the boats cowan ordered
a simultaneous bombing raid aiming to
distract the bolshevik gunners as much
as possible and cover the high-speed
approach of the coastal motorboats
the attack was scheduled for the middle
of august and in rehearsals the boat
crews soon found out what a tough task
they had
the harbour entrance was only 50 meters
wide and the harbour itself barely a
kilometer across
the boats would need to maneuver inside
this tight space at incredibly high
speed both to avoid the copious fire
from bolshevik shore batteries and
because the torpedoes wouldn't work if
fired from less than 30 knots
and they'd be doing all of this in the
dark
because of the lack of room it was
decided to attack in two waves of three
with agar on overwatch outside and one
boat ordered to attack the destroyer
gavril which was guarding the entrance
to the main harbour
at 9 30 pm on august 18th the now
lieutenant commander augustus agar led
the eight motorboats east towards
kronstadt
at some point after crossing the russian
minefield the group became split up in
the dark with commander dobson's boat
taking a more southerly course towards
the line of fort that guarded the
entrance to petrograd
soon agar only had two boats for company
left helen lawrence napier's cnb 24 and
sub-left-handed francis howard's cmb 86
howard's boat was in all sorts of engine
trouble though and shortly after passing
through the fort broke down entirely
unable to keep up with its compatriots
meanwhile the route taken by dobson
actually turned out to be quicker and he
arrived ahead of schedule
this was problematic because not only
had the diversionary air assault not
started yet
lieutenant napier's boat was the one
detailed to sink the russian destroyer
before the others entered the harbour
and he was not there yet
luckily for dobson and the two other
boats in the first wave the crew won
gavril were completely unaware of their
presence and the british ships began
their attack
first in was cnb 31 under lieutenant
william bremner he sped into the harbour
just as the first british planes arrived
overhead sending bolshevik sailors to
their guns
lieutenant bremner steadied his boat and
sped towards the submarine depot ship
pamyat azova
whilst this was happening outside the
harbour agar and napier arrived and the
latter began an attack run on gavril
whilst under the fire of at least nine
shore batteries and the destroyer itself
the torpedo was launched but it missed
and cmb-24 was blown apart by shellfire
now exposed to intense fire from the
very much intact russian destroyer
commander dobson in cmb-31 dashed into
the harbour
the gun and shell fire was now just as
bad inside with searchlights sweeping
the area there was a large explosion as
bremner's torpedo found its mark and
sank the pamiatas over
dobson's boat was in fact traveling so
fast when it entered the harbour it very
nearly ran into the sinking depot ship
in the nick of time the helmsman russell
mcbean cut one engine and shoved the
rudder hard over lining it up on the
pre-dreadnought battleship andrei
perbozzani then racing across the
harbour towards it
dobson waited for the engine to reach
1000 rpm and then fired both of his
torpedoes they surged forwards and
smashed into the pre-dreadnought
battleship blowing massive holes in its
side
lieutenant dale reed's boat was the next
to make an attack under intense fire
dale reed was hit and mortally wounded
so left helen gordon steele took over
the helm steering the boat to fire a
further torpedo with andre pervezani and
then a few moments later one at the
dreadnought battleship petropavlovsk
two large explosions were observed
outside the harbour the second wave was
now preparing to enter the boat under
left helen commander frank braid and
left hand edward bodley approached the
entrance
bodily was forced to turn away when a
shell broke the torpedo releasing
mechanism but braid pushed on at high
speed
as soon as he entered the harbour
searchlights picked up the boat blinding
the crew with a bright light that meant
they couldn't see left-handed bremner's
boat emerging from the dark directly
into their path
brandon's boat which was on its way out
after waiting to see dobson and dale
reed clear was almost cut in half by
braids and the two vessels were stuck
together stationary in the middle of
lethal fire from all directions
a few raf planes remained overhead and
they dive to strafe the bolshevik gun
and search light emplacements giving it
enough cover for the boat crew to
disentangle themselves and transfer the
crew of bremner's shattered boat to
braids rather more intact vessel
lieutenant braid now took his damaged
bow out of the harbour but was still
determined to use his torpedo before
heading home
he lined the boat up on gavril racing
towards it under a hail of fire from the
destroyer and the shore batteries who
now had virtually nothing else to shoot
at
before he could complete the attack
though braid was shot dead
bremner immediately took over command
firing two torpedoes that went on to
pass agonisingly underneath the
bolshevik destroyer cmb 62 was then hit
twice by shellfire disabling the boat
and leaving it stranded
bremner and his crew refused to
surrender and its two machine guns
continued firing even as their captain
was wounded 11 times and the boat
disintegrated beneath them
by the morning of august 19th both sides
were counting their losses the british
motorboats arrived back at bjorko having
lost three of their number
eighteen men were missing presumed dead
though it would turn out that nine of
these had in fact been captured
including incredibly lieutenant bremner
lieutenant steele and commander dobson
were awarded the victoria cross for
their role in the raid britain's highest
award for gallantry and augustus agar
received the same decoration for his
solo raid on the cruiser oleg in june
on the bolshevik side the raid had done
serious damage to its baltic fleet the
battleship andre pervezani and submarine
depot ship pamya tazova have been put
out of action and the british claimed
the petropavlovsk was similarly damaged
though this is disputed by soviet
sources tracking down exact numbers for
russian casualties has proved elusive
though considering the shallow
surroundings they are likely to have
been relatively limited
regardless of the exact amount of damage
done the effect of the raids on
chronostrat was that the red fleet
ceased to be a serious problem for the
british operation in the baltic and when
combined with fuel shortages meant that
the bolsheviks were unable to project
serious naval power beyond its own
minefields securing estonia and latvia's
seaward flank and aiding their
successful fight for independence thanks
for watching this video if you want to
dive deeper into the raid on kronstadt
check out this infographic poster we
made covering the battle it has even
more detail than this video and is
available right now on teespring with 20
off if you use the code baltic
thanks as well to the estorograph
patrons for their ongoing support and
i'll see you in the next video

you
I think the term we would use now is
mixed martial arts Barton Wright had put
together kind of an interesting brain
trust there of martial artists from
around the world he is fully issue you
only one who stood it so he was probably
the only master of autism wasn't kind of
an early booster what was exciting as at
Barton right
certainly pioneered brought back to the
fore and actually several women can
defend themselves and then what physical
kind of wait but do so elegantly you
couldn't buy in retrospect using no
important figure for the same time who
was always forgotten for many members
the thing is anybody who's ahead of the
time when they're not there or the
fashions that would change they do get
sugar
not exactly pushing the background
because it's almost like they never were
behind the walls of that club in London
they must have done something other than
just go through the same basic set of
moves you have to assume that they stood
around and talked and try different
things out on each other and developed
new ideas you're trying to play with
them a little and say well okay what if
your opponent doesn't cooperate try
something you're not expecting how are
you going to respond to that I'm seeing
meetings and in Italy and in Germany and
British Columbia seems like every
weekend there's a new place where
somebody's trying it out there's the art
it's not ours it's Barton writes and
we're not going to rubber stamp it and
say you have to come to us before you
can do whatever you want we think that's
that's our legacy in it because it's his
legs

remember when our Gore was into truth
wanted to force it on us no matter how
inconvenient it was we heard a lot about
that film I just typed its title into
the ABC search engine and got a couple
of pages of results let me tell you
about another film planet of the humans
I typed that into the ABC search engine
and came up blank this is a documentary
that absolutely skews the renewable
energy industry which is kind of strange
because this is a film of the far green
left directed by Jeff Gibbs its
executive producer is Michael Moore the
millionaire leftist Academy
award-winning director of Bowling for
Columbine Fahrenheit 911 and Trump land
however in this film the argument is
that renewable energy is not clean not
green and not practical have a look at
this segment exposing a General Motors
promotion of electric cars
because everybody thought we killed the
electric vehicle no we didn't
so what's charging the batteries right
now what where what's the source of uh
well here it's coming from the building
I mean is it um what's our mix of power
oh actually Lansing feeds the building
what's that Lansing feeds power to the
building so I don't I don't know
I bet you they're a bit of cool a lot of
they're heavy on natural gas right now
the car is charging off of your grid
right it would be charging off uh our
grid which is nine about 95 call how
long do you think it will be before
there's a solar and wind powered grid oh
golly to suggest that all of the power
used for these cars will be generated
from wind and solar in the very near
future would not be correct in fact
these were talking about charging these
up at night so there won't be any solar
at that time so we're down to wind and
very often at night the wind does fall
off
that reminds me of last year's federal
election campaign the film goes on to
attack major corporations for their
pretense their virtue signaling on
renewable energy
Bill claims to be 100 renewable we never
stop thinking about what's best for the
planet we now run apple on 100 renewable
energy
[Applause]
and they did chop down a forest to put
up solar panels near their North
Carolina plant but they didn't
disconnect from the grid and they can't
Duke says energy hungry companies like
apple can never go entirely Off the Grid
they're still hooked up to our grid
despite all the claims I haven't found a
single entity anywhere in the world
that's running on 100 solar and wind
alone
wow this is the sort of hypocrisy and
reality that we on the center right
usually point out and it's coming from
the hard left the film even argues that
the mining of rare Metals intensive
energy used to make steel wind turbines
land clearing for solar farms and the
need to dispose of them and replace this
infrastructure within a decade or two is
not well
um it's not environmentally friendly
so after all the mining
the fossil fuels
the toxins
the environmental destruction
here's what happens next
[Music]
only a few years after it was built
things that Ivan Palm began to fall
apart
broken mirrors littered the desert
yes these giant solar and wind
technology installations
May last only a few decades
then tear it down and start all over
again
if there's enough Planet left
if there's enough Planet left yep it is
catastrophist this is full-on climate
alarmism that's the part the green left
media will love the guardian the nine
newspapers and the ABC will nod their
heads at this stuff it's what they've
been saying for years but this film
exposes their incurious backing for
renewable energy on the center right
we've always said that Renewables are
nice if they work but they're expensive
unreliable impractical and frankly a bit
of a con now the left are onto this for
instance exposing the absolute nonsense
of so-called biomass green energy
essentially just burning trees
you got everything here
you have the number one polluter in the
state that people think emits magical
fairy dust from the smokestack
reality is what you have is a facility
that burns 400 000 Green tons a year or
trees this facility Burns 30 cords of
wood per hour that's a hell of a lot of
wood and on top of that it actually
Burns natural gas as well do you think
you would have to have 10 of these to
replace one average coal-fired power
plants you know it's just not going to
work it's just nuts it takes a great
deal of fossil fuels to cut down all
these trees to truck them in to use the
big machinery to dump the wood chips
everywhere so the idea that somehow this
is not anything to do is fossil fuels
just doesn't make any sense it couldn't
happen without fossil fuels in fact
renewable energy because you can grow
more trees
apart from all this planet of the humans
exposes how big money major corporations
and Wealthy investors profit from all of
this soaking up government subsidies and
profiting from Green posturing
Bloomberg sponsored a U.N climate
session to discuss wrapping up biomass
and biofuels around the world
billionaires were in love with the idea
of turning what was left of nature into
green profits
remember when Al Gore had gotten Richard
Branson to invest billions into saving
the planet Richard Branson founder of
Virgin Atlantic powered a Boeing 747
from London to Amsterdam on a coconut
oil mixture to highlight the potential
of this amazing oil as a clean energy
biofuel
Branson had actually invested in
biofuels
he was attempting to replace the jet
fuel damaging the planet with biofuels
that required the consumption of The
Living Planet
it's hard to believe we're seeing this
from the left isn't it but why haven't
you heard much about it why isn't the
ABC talking about this showing this film
debating it they usually love Mike
Moore's films they usually love to
promote the political films of the green
left this one goes too far for them of
course it attacks Renewables and people
that most climate alarmists regard as
secular Saints like Al Gore
on one side we have gold bars
um
don't they look good I'd just like to
have some of those gold bars on the
other side of the scales the entire
planet
if we do the right thing then we're
going to create a lot of wealth
and when it came time for Al Gore to
choose between the entire planet and
getting him some of them gold bars what
choice did he make
here's Al Gore earning his keep by
pretending to care about the rainforest
while lobbying Congress on behalf of the
sugar cane ethanol industry
any comment on the Brazilian effort here
with the issue of the possibility
expanding into that Amazon River Basin
with further deforestation to produce
more ethanol on a sugar cane is a worry
and I apparently you're not as concerned
about that because no no I I am I simply
forgot
look to be fair there are a few things
this film forgets too such as the fact
it's a good thing when natural gas-fired
electricity replaces coal this Cuts
emissions by at least half and allows
better integration with renewable energy
the film also conveniently forgets that
nuclear energy is the emissions-free
Silver Bullet that could sustain much of
the planet with base load power the film
argues the only solution to all of this
is to reduce our population but it also
forgets that as countries become
developed prosperous and educated thanks
in large part to Reliable and cheap
energy they tend to slow or stop their
population growth but to bring this back
to the domestic media it seems the ABC
has forgotten about Mike Moore in this
film last I checked they hadn't reported
on it at all
it seems to present too many
inconvenient truths

[Music]
in this video we are going to visit the
mercy tribe of southern ethiopia
we will look at their customs
watch a house being built
and we will end by examining one aspect
of the impact of the western world upon
this remote tribe
[Music]
the mercy are nomadic pastoralists whose
lives center around their herds of
african cattle
over the years they have been featured
in many prominent magazines
because of their large lip plates
earplugs and the scarification that
makes patterns in raised bumps on their
skin
but this is only one aspect of their
lives
[Music]
the staple diet of the mercy it's a
traditional african porridge made from
mealy meal which is washed down with
milk
the grain is turned to flower using a
saddle coin
these tools have been used since
neolithic times and are said to have a
symbolic meaning too
for the two stones gently wear until
they eventually fit together as
comfortably as a husband and wife after
years of marriage
[Music]
women and children of all ages cook and
a wife will usually prepare food for her
husband
she must always wear her lip plate when
serving him as a sign of respect
from a western point of view it is easy
to judge these cultural ways
but as researchers we try not to
interfere
[Music]
okay
[Music]
mercy women cut their head hair short
often into wonderful patterns
but they believe that all body hair is
unattractive and pluck it from
themselves and from each other
this includes their eyebrows and even
their eyelashes
it is an important part of bonding and
friendship between the girls and starts
in early adolescence
okay
[Music]
the entire village moves every six to
nine months depending upon the quality
of the surrounding grazing
they do not move together but relocate
one family at a time
[Music]
the wives carry all of the family's
belongings
and the men will take a longer route
herding the cattle through the most
fertile grounds
and usually arriving once the compound
has already been established
often the hut building is done entirely
by the women and children as soon as
they arrive
but here our hut is being built to
welcome a new wife
so the husband joins in
their culture is very different to ours
and the wives will form a unit and
support each other while the men are
away hurting
sometimes for many weeks at a time
[Music]
[Music]
it takes three to four days to collect
the materials
mostly thin branches and grass
and the work can only be done in the
early morning or late evening
as temperatures can soar above 40
degrees during the day
[Music]
[Music]
rope is made from the pith of the bark
it is known as bast
it takes far more skill than at first
appears
[Music]
the branches need to be fresh and are
softened before use
foreign
everything is tied using bast to make
the structure as strong as possible
[Music]
[Music]
the ring tied at the base
stops the sticks from springing out
it is an alternative to making deep
holes in the ground to plant the ribs in
and it means a whole hut can also be
moved in one piece if necessary
[Music]
foreign
okay
[Music]
children start to join in from a very
early age and learn about architecture
at the same time that they are learning
language
building helps to develop fine motor
skills and complex problem-solving
abilities
it also keeps the children busy while
setting up a new camp and speeds up the
build process
the hut is protection against animal and
human predators
so the sooner it can be finished the
better
[Music]
door is narrow and low
anyone entering the hut must stoop to
the ground
[Music]
in the heat of the day
the women have set up a cowhide to be
prepared as a sleeping mat for the hut
it provides little comfort but is a
barrier against dirt and insects
it has already been stretched and dried
and now is scraped
not so much to make it soft but more to
make it light enough to carry between
caps
a community soon gathers and singing
helps the world
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
elephant grass is gathered for the roof
and then
[Music]
foreign
um
[Music]
um
[Music]
whatever
[Music]
wow
[Music]
okay
[Music]
an exoskeleton is placed over the top of
the thatch to hold everything tightly in
place
[Music]
inside the finished hut everything is
safe and cozy
some huts are small
here just for two friends
[Music]
others can be large
here for the chief who must be able to
entertain the elders of the village
before we move on to the final and more
challenging part of this video
you may have noticed that there are no
adverts on this video at all
and this is thanks to our new sponsors
one dream
our videos are expensive to produce and
we cannot do this without some support
we were more than delighted to form a
connection to this amazing partner they
have an incredible number of high
quality educational videos on their site
covering a vast range of subjects you
can learn about history and mathematics
dance and religion
but a few i have particularly enjoyed
have been the series on the mighty
warrior nomads of the asian steps
and the course by world leading
egyptologist belinda hartwig
who will tell you all the latest
research into the great pyramid
give you instructions on how to build
one for yourself
and also take you into lesser known but
equally fascinating aspects of egyptian
culture
as an architect i always want to
encourage everyone to draw
and it really is not that difficult
the courses by paul houston are
fantastic
especially those on pen drawing
with techniques such as hatching and
stippling all clearly explained
one dream are offering you a free trial

[Music]
the african cow by nature grows its
horns sharp and wide
and this is a useful defense against
predators
but in a herd this can cause problems
for the other cattle and for the herders
too
[Music]
as a result the horns of each young car
are reset
[Music]
some people may find this process
disturbing
and whilst it is probably painful
it does not appear to cause harm or
distress to the cattle in the long run
and it does save them from puncturing
the heights of their neighbors
[Music]
young men frequently take the herd off
from the village
sometimes for weeks at a time
and to avoid having to kill the cattle
for food they live off fresh milk and
blood
the blood is taken directly from an
artery
fresh
[Music]
we spent two weeks with these people
getting to know them
learning about their culture and their
language frequently treating medical
conditions and helping them in any way
but we were a little bit shocked to see
how many tourists turned up over this
period
such as these english photographers
photos of african natives fetch good
money
and the locals can hear them coming from
far away and quickly prepare themselves
[Music]
the photographers have arrived and lined
them all up
those selected will receive about five
cents each
the photo of course will be sold for
thousands of times this sum
but these english photographers don't
like it when i point to camera at them
and they send their guard over to stop
me filming
but i think i got enough to show you
what's going on
i would ask you to comment
is it fair and reasonable for us western
tourists to actually come into these
tribal communities at all
[Music]
still eventually everyone goes home and
the party can begin
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay

Michael Franzese: If a mob boss was ever
visiting a psychiatrist,
he'd be in the trunk of his
car by the end of the week.
Along with the psychiatrist.
That would never happen.
My name is Michael Franzese,
and I was a former capo in
the Colombo crime family,
one of the five New York
Mafia La Cosa Nostra families.
I'm now residing in the Los Angeles area,
and I'm here to be a movie critic.
This would never happen.
First of all, it's too much
work involved in this, you know?
You've got so many guys.
Usually mob hits are not done like that.
I mean, they're normally
done at close range,
small-caliber guns and
shotguns being used.
I never saw anything like this before.
I know back in the '20s
they used machine guns.
"Tommy guns" was the term back then.
But, to me, this scene
seems to be unrealistic.
Jelly: Oh. Oh,
che stai facendo?
Dr. Sobel: Hey, Easter weekend, eh?
Franzese: There was
always a guy of that size.
In every crew and every
family there was always
somebody that big that was around.
Italians eat a lot, and
some of them get real big.
You know, I doubt you'd
ever see this many people.
The last time something like this occurred
was Appalachia, back in New York,
when guys from all over
the country came in.
I think they probably modeled
this scene after that.
You know, ever since law enforcement
invaded that meeting,
it never happened again.
And that I know for a fact.
Michael: We're both part
of the same hypocrisy.
But never think it applies to my family.
Pat: All right. All right.
Some people have to play little games.
Franzese: We infiltrated
society on every level,
from the guy on the street,
the numbers business,
right up to the White House.
And you would never see a
politician talk to us like that
because most of them we supported.
And I'm wondering if I would've
been able to stay calm.
Which was the right thing to do.
Michael: I know it was you, Fredo.
Franzese: This kiss of death,
that was a Sicilian thing, I believe,
and certainly something that
might've happened in Italy.
This is a scene that, you know,
that became close to me
because I had a brother,
I have a brother that
actually turned informant.
Testified against my dad, and
actually tried to hurt me,
and went into the Witness
Protection Program.
Haven't seen him in 10 years.
It's very hard to bear, hard to deal with.
Since I walked away from that life
and basically, you know, violated my oath
just by walking away,
not that I ever hurt anybody,
but just by walking away,
contract on my life, the whole bit.
Did you ever worry about your family?
And my answer is no.
We didn't go after law enforcement.
We didn't bother anybody's
family, that was hands off.
In Italy, you know,
they go after your
family, law enforcement,
I mean, you know, there's no rules
when it comes to stuff like that.
Ace: Can you do it with your left hand?
Signaller: Well, I've never tried.
Ace: So you're a righty?
Signaller: Yeah.
Franzese: I can tell you this
scene is not unrealistic,
because, you know, in a mob-run casino,
we certainly wouldn't have tolerated
anybody cheating like that.
So it could've been this, I mean,
you break somebody's legs,
put them in a hospital.
Even though this is Lefty Rosenthal,
he wasn't a made member,
but he was an associate,
but he dressed the part.
De Niro and Gotti, and,
you know, even myself,
we dressed up pretty good.
At every weekend, I was
at weddings and funerals.
Half the time I didn't know who died
or who was getting married,
but we had to go as a matter of respect.
So we had to dress up quite a bit.
I mean, I probably had
50 suits at that time.
Donnie: Like Raquel Welch
is one great piece of ass,
forget about it.
But then, if you disagree,
like a Lincoln is better
than a Cadillac, forget about it.
Franzese: All right,
I gotta tell you this.
This is probably one of
the most realistic scenes
in all of mob moviedom.
You know, it's funny. I'm a speaker now,
and every time I say, "fuggedaboutit,"
which I say by habit,
people laugh, you know.
This scene made that word famous.
It applies to everything.
Just like the sit-down.
Anytime you had any kind of meeting,
it was always at a sit-down.
Had a sit-down, and discuss, you know,
a life-and-death matter.
We had a sit-down just to have dinner.
Everything was done at a sit-down.
Chili: You're an entry
in my book, that's all.
You're just a guy who owes me money.
Martin: All right.
How about this?
[Franzese laughs]
Franzese: It's, No. 1, it's the perception
that this person is a serious guy,
that can, you know, maybe hurt you,
and that intensifies that look.
'Cause I know a lot of times, you know,
people said, "Hey, all you've
got to do is look at somebody,
and they get nervous."
Travolta, I thought, killed this role.
You know, a lot of mob guys, I mean,
myself being one of them, got
involved in entertainment.
Travolta took it to another level,
wanting to be a director
and whatever it was.
We were more or less behind
the scenes, you know,
financing some of these things,
getting to know some of the people,
some of the perks involved with it.
Really, that was it.
Henry: Then you had Nicky Eyes...
Nicky: What's up, guy?
Henry: And Mikey Franzese.
Mikey: I saw that guy,
yeah, I wanna see him.
Franzese: Yeah, no, I don't
think he really looked like me.
I'll be honest with you,
I was in the theater.
I had just gotten out of prison,
and I went to see this with my wife.
And after a few minutes she
looked at me and she said,
you know: "Is this
really what you guys did?
Is that what your life was all about?"
And I said: "Honey, c'mon, it's a movie.
They make things up."
You know, "Don't pay attention."
No sooner do I say that
than they introduce my character,
and she looks at me,
and I say, "C'mon, we gotta go."
And I walked out, 'cause I
didn't know why they put me in.
It was a different crew.
Henry: Here's Frankie the Wop.
Frankie: Listen, are you out of trouble?
Henry: Freddie No Nose.
Freddie: Hey, how're ya doing?
Franzese: People say,
"Well, how did you come up
with those nicknames?" You know, like,
there was a guy that
we called Chicken Head.
And the reason we called him that
because he used to shoot
the head off of chickens
when he was practicing his marksmanship.
You know, we had Benny Eggs.
"Well, why'd you call him Benny Eggs?"
Well, he liked eggs.
He ate them all the time.
So we weren't really
original with the names.
We had Fat Tony Salerno.
"Why'd you call him Fat Tony?"
Well, he was fat.
Tommy: What do you mean, funny?
Funny how? How am I funny?
Henry: Just...
Franzese: You know, they
made Henry out to be
a lot more
significant in the life
than he really was.
He was just a lost soul.
He always had a drug
problem, alcohol problem.
For me, Joe Pesci is the best
portrayer of any mob guy.
You know, he was around street guys,
he knew guys out on the street.
And he just had it down so perfectly.
Police: Hey, put your eyes up.
Franzese: You know, most
of the local police,
they didn't bother us.
You know, it was really
the FBI and, you know,
investigative agencies like
that, especially the feds.
I doubt if anybody,
even though he was protecting his son,
would ever come right out front like that
and look to put people on
front street, so to speak.
Front street, in other words,
you're telling the police that, you know,
one of these guys might be
guilty of doing something.
So you're actually,
you know, in mob terms,
you're becoming a rat or a snitch.
And, you know, you pay a price for that.
Charlie: He has about $30.
It's all he's got on him, Michael.
Michael: Where's the rest?
Charlie: Yeah, where's the rest?
Johnny Boy: Well, I bought
a few rounds of drinks
over here while I was waiting.
Franzese: You know, this
whole shylocking scene,
you know, very accurate.
Shylocking, loan sharking, you know,
basically lending money at usurious rates.
And everybody that was in that life
was in that business. That had any money.
You know, he plays these roles good.
I think, today, you know,
the way De Niro's acting,
he thinks he really is a
mob guy, you know. [laughs]
It's kinda permeated his
whole being and his character.
Marge: Homer, where'd you get that truck?
Homer: Uh...it fell off a truck.
You know, a truck truck.
Franzese: A lot of
things fell off a truck.
I mean, that was the
expression that we used.
Whether it be clothing, a suit, you know,
electronics, cars, whatever.
You know, hijacking was a
big thing back in the day,
no question about it.
And there was some guys that
were professional hijackers.
Today, it's very difficult,
but it was a lot easier
to change the serial numbers
and make a new car out of it,
and nobody could ever find it, so.
Hoffa: Let's get outta
here, Frankie, c'mon.
Franzese: You know, I'm a little bit jaded
when I look at this film,
only because I know
that the Sheeran story is fiction.
I mean, he didn't kill Hoffa.
I didn't know Jimmy Hoffa personally,
but it was during my time.
But I do have insight into,
you know, what really happened there.
He was a hot-headed guy,
and he was one of the most powerful guys
in the country at that point.
Remember this, you control the teamsters,
in a big way, you control the country.
You know, No. 1, you
got zillions of dollars
in your pension funds.
You call a strike as a teamster, you know,
you've got 2 1/2 million people stopping,
nothing gets delivered, everything stops,
and that's a tremendous amount of power.
The Joey Gallo killing, that was,
'cause I know, you know, for
a fact, what happened there.
Like I said, that was our time.
And, you know, I was
in the middle of that.
I wasn't the shooter, don't get me wrong,
but I knew it was our family.
For him to be so, you know,
outspoken about doing
that, it was just so wrong.
I mean, the scene was accurate.
I mean, he did get killed in that way.
He did get out into the street,
and they did get him there,
and his family was there, the whole thing.
But Sheeran wasn't the shooter.
Reporter: You are in effect
the mayor of Chicago,
you've not simply been
appointed to that position.
Franzese: I mean, he
certainly looked the part.
You know, everybody looks
at Capone like he was
a 40, 50-year-old guy.
He was, like, 29 years old.
He was in his 30s when
he passed away, I think.
You know, Capone was bigger
than life in the movies.
He wasn't bigger than life with us.
I mean, nobody really regarded him.
You know, even my father said, you know:
"We chased him out of Brooklyn.
He went to Chicago."
And my father's 103,
so he was around all of these guys.
You know, unfortunately, I
get asked about all the time
is about murder in that life.
And I will tell you this.
Murder was taken very seriously, OK?
It can only be approved by the boss.
So I've been very, very
fortunate to be here,
where I am now, and not dead or in prison,
like just about all of my associates.
If a mob boss was ever
visiting a psychiatrist,
he'd be in the trunk of his
car by the end of the week,
along with the psychiatrist.
That would never happen.
Crowd: Don't do it.
No, no, no!
Don't do it!
My arm!
Franzese: There's no way in the world
if a mob boss hit anybody
that that guy would come back at him.
No way.
Especially in front of audience.
If he did,
you don't ever raise
your hand to a made guy.
No matter who you are, you raise your hand
to a made guy, you're dead,
and so, and they know that.
So this is not a realistic scene.
So David Chase gets in
touch with me through
a friend of mine, Jack
Gilardi at ICM, and he says:
"Look, I'm doing this series for Fox.
And we want you to be
involved as a consultant."
And I said, "You know, I'm on
parole and all this stuff."
So I turned it down.
That's how smart I am, right?
"The Sopranos."
But I always wondered why he contacted me.
In my house, back in the
'60s when it was being built,
the government, the FBI,
installed a bugging device.
They had it in the kitchen of our house,
and they picked up a lot of the
conversation on a daily basis.
And I am telling you
that Tony Soprano's mother
was so much like my mother.
You know, maybe he got the
Freedom of Information Act,
maybe he did something, but he got a hold
of that surveillance tapes,
and he patterned that woman
on my mother.
And I said, I would, I tell you,
I would almost stake my life.
I've never had a chance
to talk to him about it.
Carmine: One other thing, though.
John said he went to a
cookout at your house.
Tony: Yeah.
Carmine: A don doesn't wear shorts.
Franzese: That's not true at all.
I mean, I saw...[scoffs]
you know, on a hot summer
day in Harlem, you know,
guys would sit out in front
of their social clubs,
and they'd be in shorts.
Even the boss.
I mean, you know, that's not true.
I mean, you go on a
boat, you're in shorts.
Or maybe somebody told them that
that, you know, didn't know
what they were talking about.
But that's not true.

countries and being split into two name
a more iconic duo and whilst germany
ireland and korea are the most often
discussed another country with such a
divide is cyprus which since the 1970s
has been divided into two parts or three
if you count those that still belong to
britain in the south sits the republic
of cyprus recognised by everyone and in
the north lies the turkish republic of
northern cyprus which is recognised only
by turkey and this state of affairs
raises an obvious question what caused
this to happen why is cyprus divided so
before cyprus was split it was a british
colony which they had acquired from the
ottomans in 1878 and many of those
living there were greek cypriots most of
whom wish to unify with greece in a
process known as anosys however that's
not how empire works and the british
opted to ignore them because cyprus's
position was far too valuable to them
many decades later like most british
colonies in the wake of the second world
war cyprus and its people pushed for
independence in the mid-1950s greek
cypriots began an armed campaign which
wanted to end british rule there and
unify the island with greece of course
the british were happy to accept these
demands and just kidding they teamed up
with the turkish cypriots to fight back
and in the end settled on giving cyprus
his independence and britain preferred
an independent cyprus that wasn't a part
of greece since it wanted military bases
there as a forward base for the middle
east cyprus as a small new nation could
be coerced into agreeing to this in
return for the end of british rule
whereas greece was a much larger
established country that would be able
to resist after the british had left the
island well mostly tensions rose between
the greek and turkish population there
one of the conditions of cypriot
independence was that the turkish
minorities rights would be respected and
also it was agreed that no one would
push for a union with either greece or
turkey nor try to partition the island
and greece turkey and britain all agree
to uphold this status despite the
agreement many greek cypriots including
president macarius felt that the turkish
were overrepresented and so wanted that
changed shockingly the turkish cypriots
didn't want this and so a decade of
impasse in 1974 feeling that macarius
wasn't doing enough a group of the
nurses-backing cypriots aided by the
dictatorship in greece launched a coup
macarios fled and nicos sampson was
placed in charge and made it clear that
he was going to unify cyprus with greece
and now the turkish government was
concerned for the welfare of turkish
cypriots who were subject to growing
violence and so ask britain to help them
intervene and the british said no and
for this they had two reasons the first
was that they were too busy being poor
and the second was that those in
government above all else wanted to keep
their military bases and thus by not
picking aside it was hoped that they
could leverage the fact that they didn't
oppose the eventual winners to keep
their territory on cyprus as a result
turkey opted to proceed alone turkish
troops landed here and they very quickly
and easily pushed greek cypriot forces
back across the island this was
condemned by the united states who
didn't want two nato members going to
war and breaking the alliance but
generally most countries were
sympathetic to the turkish all of this
embarrassed the military government in
greece and fears over all that war led
to the collapse of the regime there
whilst the greeks were busy becoming a
democracy again the turkish opted to
push even further across cyprus at this
point the rest of the world turned
against turkey since this was now seen
as little more than territorial
expansion as such the turkish british
and greek governments met to end
hostilities and a ceasefire was agreed
the turkish military stayed in the lands
that it had taken and the united nations
would construct a demilitarized zone
running across the island and it was
hoped that with the greek back coup over
in the violence diminishing turkey would
leave but fun fact no instead the
turkish created the turkish cypriot
administration which would run the
territory the turkish had captured and
in the wake of the creation of this
administration many greek cypriots were
forced out of their homes and cleared
from the north and in the south many
turkish cypriots were also made
unwelcome and forced to head north and
in 1983 the turkish cypriot government
there made a unilateral declaration of
independence which was condemned by
everybody except for turkey pakistan and
bangladesh and the last two were soon
pressured into withdrawing their support
leaving only turkey supporting the north
but irrespective of international
support the island still remains divided
to this day

[Music]
this is Camila one of the largest cities
in Bangladesh with a population of more
than 6 million this Southeastern city
has been always known for its culture
and Heritage but in recent years
tensions between the Muslim majority and
religious minorities have been on the
rise
[Music]
now Hindus are again preparing for their
biggest religious Festival Durga Puja
Menifee the festival could again be the
target of sectarian attacks
foreign
[Music]
has been a Craftsman his whole life in
his Workshop he and his team make Idols
for worshiping
it's just a couple of weeks ahead of
Puja the busiest time of the year for
him
it takes eight days to finish the basic
structure and the clay work
then we need two more days to color it
first we make this background frame with
wood and bamboo then we make an idle
structure with hay and set them on the
frame after that we start the clay work
Paul was the Craftsman who made the idol
at the center of last year's communal
tension a video Hit social media saying
that the Quran had been discovered on a
Hindu deities lab enriched Muslims
vandalized the meship temple and
destroyed the idols Paul made
similar incidents later broke out in
various parts of the country seven
people were killed and dozens injured
it felt very bad what else could I feel
the idol that I made myself was
destroyed we could not even provide the
offerings
that's a matter of Sorrow
we give blessings and pray to the idol
my heart broke
foreign
footage revealed that the Quran was put
there by a Muslim man but by then it was
already too late
we are invited to ratnadasa's house
she lives in a Hindu majority
neighborhood in kumila
she has finished her everyday prayers
and is preparing for the Festival this
year
Festival approaches our hearts fill with
joy
this is our biggest Festival Durga Puja
we celebrate big
we shop for new clothes prepare sweets
and make Feast offerings to God
but this year thus in her neighbors fear
that the Hindu Community could suffer
similar Violence new barriers are being
built a reaction to last year's riots
because of the incident that happened
during the last dogapuja we've built
this gate to protect ourselves from
outside people
on that day we were preparing ourselves
to go to different temples and give
offerings
but at noon a mob came and started
attacking
they came here
the men and women from our area built a
wall
that's why they couldn't break in but
they vandalized the other adjacent areas
foreign whether the gate will really be
necessary and will protect the
neighborhood is unclear but it does show
clearly that many Hindu people in kumila
don't feel safe
ratna and Nipa take us to a nearby
Temple that was attacked and is now
being renovated
they broke in and took out all the
lights
they vandalized the idols and took sound
boxes away
if we don't feel safe in Bangladesh then
we have no value here
many Hindus feel like ratnadas
for decades increasing number of Hindus
have been living the South Asian country
the proportion of them is shrinking day
by day and is now less than eight
percent today more than 90 percent of
people in Bangladesh and Muslims Islam
is the state religion but on the other
hand there is freedom of religion
[Music]
prime minister Sheikh Hasina has vowed
to protect this privilege but religious
fundamentalism is on the rise
the government also blames the communal
tensions in India for feeling the crisis
in Bangladesh local human rights groups
have counted more than 3 000 such
attacks in recent years
Dhaka the capital of Bangladesh
here is the central Hindu temple called
dhakashari
[Music]
thank you
we are received by chandranath bodder a
member of the central Puja organizing
committee and a teacher he tells us that
there are more than 32 000 Puja
celebration sport similar to last year
he says a security threat is not enough
to make them reduce the numbers
we have to survive
to survive just as we have to eat we
also must make people feel strong we
have to do our prayers because they're
part of our lives
that respect we're prepared to host Puja
and I've asked the government to give us
security
[Music]
the authorities say that they are ready
to stop any outbreaks of violence this
year but argue that there is no
organized political or criminal agenda
behind the riots
we don't have proof that these acts are
done with any political agenda or any
organized intentions
but when an incident like the one in
Camilla or elsewhere takes place and it
offends a religious group that incites
some people to mobilize and react
foreign
[Music]
during Friday prayers to find out how
worshipers feel about relations with the
people of other faiths
[Music]
they tell us the relationship is not
hostile
s
Islam says to follow your religion
and if there are people from another
religion do not do anything to harm them
if there's a conflict there are laws and
Judicial Systems to solve it
we want everyone to live in peace
we want to take care of them and they
will also live with us in harmony
but the number of attacks on minorities
has grown recently if there is a rumor
of defamation a violent response often
follows
here in this mosque the clerics preach
about religious cohesiveness
[Music]
we talked to the Head Clary half his
mawlana Mufti Muhammad rahulamin he says
Muslims as a whole are blamed for crimes
committed in the name of religion by
groups with vested interests he wants
the perpetrators of last year riots to
be brought to Justice
the government should ensure that such
incidents do not happen again
they must act
they should keep an eye on these
perpetrators
our message is always the same these
acts are not accepted by religion
religion never teaches people to be
undisciplined
our duty is to spread that knowledge to
everyone
we do that
people who don't follow that and harm
others even if the government fails to
punish them Allah will
see everybody but these teachings don't
always reach the Grassroots
toddler said that there are also many
places in the country where Muslims help
the Hindus to celebrate their religious
Festival but the state is failing to
uphold that Harmony
this is very frustrating that the
perpetrators go unpunished
so they feel encouraged to Stage attacks
one after another
foreign
victims of the riots say they are being
denied Justice while the police insist
that everything is done in accordance
with the law
the reason lies in the law itself
according to Sharia Kabir a journalist
and researcher of communal conflict
based in Bangladesh he says that
Bangladeshi people are generally United
the fundamentalists are taking advantage
by creating these conflicts and on the
other hand the government is not doing
enough
a lot of times the perpetrators get away
because of the old criminal law from the
British period
it requires so many witnesses and so
much evidence that cannot be managed in
many cases
only a very few Trials take place
we've advised the government to form a
national minority commission or pass a
minority Protection Law which was also
in the election Manifesto of the ruling
party
that will at least give the minorities a
little more protection and the
perpetrators can be brought to Justice
adding the finishing touch to the idols
he's hoping that Harmony will be
restored not only for the sake of his
work but for the future of Bangladesh
[Music]

at a little past three in the morning on
November 29 1944 the American submarine
USS archerfish fired six Torpedoes and
sank the 71 000 ton Japanese super
carrier shinano this is the
extraordinary story of how a single
Submarine skippered by a then
unremarkable Captain claimed the largest
warship then afloat
the events that led to the attack and
sinking of shenano began years earlier
she was originally planned as the third
ship in Japan's Yamato class of enormous
battleships but after the disastrous
Battle of Midway in 1942 it was decided
by the Japanese Navy to convert shinano
into an aircraft carrier while she was
still under construction to be completed
in early 1945.
the work to complete shenano as what
would be the largest carrier ever to put
to Sea were extensive
once finished her colossal Hangar would
host up to 170 planes allowing the ship
to act as a central hub for the
maintenance and support of an entire
fleet aircraft
it was a hugely ambitious and Powerful
design and one that the Japanese Navy
got more and more desperate for as the
war situation declined through 1944.
in need of something to change the tide
the completion date Fortunato was rushed
forward to November 1944. this greatly
shortened deadline required a furious
effort from the workers at Yokosuka
Naval Shipyard and it was made even more
frantic when the first USB 29 bombers
began to overfly the Japanese Mainland
on reconnaissance missions
the Commerce war against Japan was
entering its final ruthlessly
destructive phase and the Japanese Navy
soon became concerned that shanana would
be spotted from the air and targeted
with bombing raids
they were therefore Keen to move the
carrier to an Anchorage that was less
exposed to American attacks the carrier
was rushed out for Builders trials on
November 11th and then hastily
commissioned into the Imperial Navy a
week later the ship was ordered to leave
Yokosuka on November 28th to head for a
safer Anchorage at curay in the Inland
sea but the carrier's inaugural Skipper
Captain toshio Abe was deeply concerned
at the state of his ship he requested a
delay to its departure as shinano only
had eight of her 12 boilers operational
and had not yet been able to carry out a
whole host of tests to check that each
compartment really was fully airtight
the request was bluntly refused with the
risk from air attacks if the carrier
remained at Yokosuka any longer deemed
to be too high
and so the aircraft carrier shinano left
port for her maiden voyage on the
afternoon of November 28 1944.
she was escorted by the kagaro-class
Destroyers isakaze hamakaze and yukikaze
there were more than two and a half
thousand people on board including 300
civilian workers who were still
completing parts of the ship
it was a risky Voyage no air cover was
available for schnanno so Captain Abe
had been forced to try and make the
passage to curate at night raising the
prospect of an attack by American
submarines
with a third of her boilers out of
action shinano could only steam at a
reduced speed of 20 knots and so she was
more vulnerable than usual to submarine
attack
by Nightfall the Japanese flotilla was
clear of Tokyo bay and had to turn to
the Southwest beginning a zigzag pattern
that would take them towards the Inland
sea
at about the same time the American
submarine archerfish was surfacing after
another day spent beneath the waves
its Captain was commander Joseph Enright
who was on his first war Patrol with the
archerfish
described by the historian clay Blair as
a cautious and uncertain Skipper more
than a year earlier Enright had asked to
be relieved from command of the USS Dace
after losing confidence in his own
abilities now though he was back at Sea
with a fresh submarine and A Renewed
determination
at 8 50 PM archerfish's radar picked up
a massive contact 22 kilometers to the
north
before too long it was visible on the
horizon as an aircraft carrier though
unlike any other scene before
this was a huge potential prize and
Enright was determined not to let it
slip through his fingers so he
authorized the regular use of his boat's
radar to be sure of his Target's
location at all times as he tried to
maneuver into an attack position
abortionano the regular emissions from
archerfish's radar could be heard loud
and clear but Captain Abe was not unduly
concerned alone submarine was not in his
mind a threat only a wolf pack of
multiple submarines attacking
simultaneously could pose a serious
danger to such a huge ship so at 10 45
PM when the Destroyer isakaze broke her
way to close down on the submarine that
was shadowing the group Captain Abe
quickly ordered it back into position he
did not want his escorts being drawn
away by a submarine acting as bait and
leaving the carrier exposed to attack by
other lurking American boats
determined to wrong foot the wolf pack
he was expecting at 11 PM are they
ordered a turn to the south at 20 knots
away from the enemy submarine Enright
pushed archerfish's engine to its
absolute maximum but the submarine could
only get to 19 knots and by half past 11
visual contact was lost with the
Japanese carrier
unable to keep up a frustrated Commander
Enright decided instead to keep on his
boat's current course hoping to be in a
better position if the carrier
eventually turned back northwards
at 11 40 shenano obliged changing course
to steam Due West after an engine fault
developed on board which cut her top
speed to 18 knots slower now than what
artifice was achieving
Captain Abe was Keen now to make
progress towards his ship's destination
but once the carrier swung West it did
not take long for archerfish to regain
contact
by this stage the boat was south of
shinano and could now turn swiftly to
stalk the carrier from this direction
as archerfish was now traveling faster
than the Japanese ship it slowly pulled
ahead positioning itself in an ideal
attack position if shanano came back to
her original course of 210 degrees
Commander Enright and his crew had no
idea what the Japanese ship's eventual
destination was so all they could do was
wait and hope unable to get any closer
on the surface without being spotted
again
the hours ticked by and shinano remained
on her Westerly course
frustrated at 2 41 am Enright sent off a
report to the Pacific Fleet at Pearl
Harbor giving the carrier's position and
course
shanana picked up this transmission a
minute later and it spooked the Japanese
skipper Captain rbe guessed that it was
a message on the commander of the wolf
pack of submarines he was convinced of
stalking the carrier and that other subs
would now be lining up ahead of him for
an attack
he quickly decided to change course and
believing it more likely that hostile
submarines would be lurking closer to
the coast to the north decided to turn
the other way and so at 2 56 am captain
Abe ordered shinano to turn to the
Southwest
watching from his colleague Tower seven
and a half miles away Commander Enright
was stunned the Japanese carrier had
turned obligingly onto the precise
bearing he had hoped and was now coming
straight for them
unable to believe his luck the American
Skipper took his boat across the
carrier's new track and swung it around
lining up for an attack on chinano's
starboard side as the 70 000 ton vessel
passed by
at 306 the submarine dived something
that the carrier was immediately aware
of as the radar Transmissions they had
been hearing for the last four hours
suddenly ceased this was a sign an
attack was imminent
seeking to throw them off Captain Abe
ordered a further changing course at 3
10 round to 180 degrees due south
by 313 shenano was just three kilometers
from the submerged archerfish which was
picking its way past the escort screen
determined to press home his attack
Enright stayed on his course even as one
of the escorts passed directly over his
boat without realizing he was there with
barely 10 feet of clearance between them
as the propellers receded Commander
Enright wasted no time he took one more
look through the Periscope and fired six
Torpedoes of the Japanese carrier in
front of him before descending rapidly
to 400 feet and getting as far away as
possible it was 3 15 am
the mark 14 Torpedoes raced over the now
very short distance to the Japanese
aircraft carrier 317 as shenano was
completing her turn to the South the
Torpedoes reached their Target's
starboard side
there were four large explosions as
two-thirds of the American Torpedoes
found their targets
the enormous carrier shuddered and it
did not take long for Captain Abe on the
bridge to realize they had been
torpedoed it was a serious development
but four torpedo hits should not in
theory lead to the loss of Abe's ship
shinano was a colossal vessel with
sophisticated armor and anti-torpedo
bulges below the waterline it had taken
19 Torpedoes and 17 bombs to sanctiono's
sistership Musashi the previous month at
Leyte golf
Captain makami these ship's second in
command soon took control of the damage
response from the number one damage
control center located in the carriers
Island initial reports were not good
mikami discovered there had been four
torpedo hits three of which were inside
the crucial Citadel of the ship where
the most important machinery and
magazines were positioned and protected
by better armor at each impact site the
Torpedoes though had punched right
through shedano's torpedo protection
where it was thinner just a few feet
below the surface the result was
catastrophic damage
at the stern storage units and an empty
aviation fuel tank have been blown open
rapidly filling with water inside the
Citadel turbine room 3 had also flooded
immediately along with Boiler Room 3 and
adjoining oil tank and the air
compressor room with significant loss of
life
as water rushed into the ship it began
to steadily list to starboard first to
five and then swiftly to 10 degrees
in the hydraulic pump room who informed
him that 3 000 tons of water was being
pumped into the port bilges to try and
counteract the growing list but that it
didn't seem to be working
it was now past 4 AM and the list was up
to 13 degrees
in the bowels of the ship Lieutenant
Commander mayura the engineering watch
officer was grappling with a situation
that was rapidly getting out of control
the initial torpedo hits were bad enough
but janano was still steaming at her
maximum speed of 18 knots as Captain Abe
tried to avoid any further hits from
other lurking submarines this put a huge
amount of stress on the already weakened
Hull and bulkheads the length of the
ship were battling under the pressure
next to the already flooded areas water
was pouring through ill-fitting doors
and rivets compromising boiler rooms one
and seven fatally
by 5 AM extensive flooding was now
starting to slow the carrier's speed as
the list steadily increased to 15 then
18 and by 6 AM 20 degrees
the ship had now healed so far over that
the water intake on the port side were
above the water line meaning the crew
could no longer counter flood on that
side shortly afterwards the ship's
remaining boilers began to shut down as
the fresh water supply failed shinano's
speed dropped to less than 10 knots the
starboard hydraulic pump room began to
fill with water and Lieutenant inada
found he and his crew trapped with
little Prospect of rescue
meanwhile on the bridge captain arbe now
appreciated the serious danger his ship
was in he ordered a course change to 300
to Simply head for the closest bit of
land he could and try and Beach the
carrier in shallow water
by now the sun was up and shinano had
traveled about 36 miles since the
torpedo impacts but at a steadily
slowing speed
the situation below decks was becoming
incredibly dangerous
engine room one had also now flooded
along with Boiler Room one
in a desperate attempt to ride the ship
at 8am Captain Abe ordered the
deliberate counter flooding of all three
boiler rooms on the port side this
provided temporary relief to the list
but with water continuing to pour in it
wasn't enough to save the carrier
at 8 30 the starboard hydraulic pump
room flooded completely
shortly before the waters overcame him
Lieutenant inada addressed the bridge
crew through a voice pipe I'm going
before you and I will pray for shinano
and her company
an hour later it was clear to everyone
that shenano was going to sink
on the bridge ensign's shoulder was
dispatched to order the crew in the
steering station who had been manually
operating these ship's Rudder Machinery
to leave their posts and head topside
one of those rescued by shoda was 16
year old Seaman ishi who would go on to
survive the sinking
more than a thousand crew were now on
the flight deck Clinging On as the ever
increasing list once again went past 20
degrees and the water began to lap at
the bottom of the island
a 1018 Captain arbe unable to bring
himself to issue an abandoned ship order
simply addressed his crew to say you are
all released from Duty save yourselves
shinano finally went down at 10 55 a.m
with Captain arbe and other officers
going down with the ship
three escorting destroyers did their
best to pick up survivors for several
hours but at 2PM they cooled off their
operations
of
2515 people on board that day
1455 died in the sinking
as shinano sank beneath the waves her
attacker made a clean getaway archerfish
returned to Guam at the end of her
patrol on December 15 1944.
after initial skepticism of Commander
enright's claim Archer fish was
eventually credited with sinking an
aircraft carrier of between 59 and 72
000 tons depending on which source you
take
whatever the size it made it not only
the largest ship ever sunk by a
submarine it also made enrights Patrol
the most successful by U.S submarine by
tonnage of the entire War
on the Japanese side the loss of shinano
was a devastating blow to plan to mount
a fight back against the Allies so as
not to harm morale its loss was kept top
secret for months with the survivors
effectively interned near curay away
from the public
an inquiry was convened under Vice
abrogenichi makawa which essentially
found that so many mistakes have been
made by so many people that it was
fruitless to assign blame
poor decision making by Captain Abe had
combined with shoddy build quality
inadequate torpedo protection and
inexperienced crew and sheer bad luck to
create a perfect storm that sent a 71
000 ton supercarrier to the bottom of
the Pacific Ocean

[Music]
handcuffs prison clothes a rough tone
these aren't convicted prisoners but
children but why are they in jail if
they didn't commit a crime
Dinka where to find out we head to
Chester South Carolina
it's Friday just before 6 o'clock in the
morning these kids will spend their
weekend in jail even though they didn't
do anything wrong
among them katrell he's just 8 years old
6 o'clock sharp is the start of the
weekend experience
those responsible for it their own
parents Cottrell's mother Deandra has
voluntarily sent her son here for
getting bad grades the parents pay $75
to treat their children as real criminal
offenders we are shocked by the harsh
treatment Courtney also finds it
difficult to see her 14 year old son
NOLA like this but she's afraid that
he'll come off the rails she sees this
weekend as a last resort
[Music]
as the way he used it was a weekend in
prison as an extreme educational measure
time to say goodbye to their parents
Noah and the rest aren't staying here
any longer with flashing blue lights and
sirens they head to the prison the goal
of the offices is to push the children
physically and mentally to their limits
for the next two days these blue walls
will be the home to NOLA and the others
[Applause]
[Music]
deputy Boyd is taking part in this
program for the first time how does he
find the harsh treatment of the kids so
you just gotta be mindful and they are
children but they got to change their
life and now so when they do get of age
they have a better path some of the kids
are actually in real trouble
Noah's mother thinks her son is hanging
out with gang members but is this kind
of deterrence the right way the children
should learn what prison life feels like
and everything that goes with it contact
with the outside world and their parents
is only possible through a thick glass
panel and in the middle of the
conversation the officer interrupts them
unannounced
[Music]
Courtney is visibly shocked but that's
exactly what the officers want to
achieve I see my mom my dad my pull-up
my grandmother and I can't touch them
because here's somebody behind me
screaming as the time comes for the
parents to go home the kids can take a
breather can Cottrell even understand
what's happening here
because
and this one moment Noah looks exhausted
how do the offices justify the extreme
handling the children like toys so what
would you prefer you prefer for us to be
hard on them here to keep people coming
in here I'll be out on the street and
learn Street lessons those harsh lessons
and end up in here which one is better
extreme deterrence this program has been
around since 2012 an important part of
this is meeting real inmates but before
that happens
katrell and the others have to spend
their first night in a Cell
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
the next day it also starts with a drill
but the tone changes a bit deputy Boyd
and the other guards call it the
building phase they try to talk some
sense to the kids
[Applause]
you will gang member or just rebellious
a profile for the program doesn't exist
the decision to send their children to
prison lies solely with their parents
before NOLA and the others meet real
inmates it's time to go to the nearby
city park social work time on the way
over we drive through Chester drugs and
gangs are a big problem here and we had
a 14-yard about three weeks ago he
killed
later lieutenant Neil is a co-founder of
the program and the Chester native but
his connection is even deeper with the
kids in the reason why my heart is in
this program is because I once was at
risk use I was actually a bad I did the
gang banging that's how we take so much
pride to the problem that we're doing
because we all once were there the
police voluntarily sacrificed their
weekend once a month they're not paid
but it's worth it
deputy Graham even took part in a
similar program there's a teenager
and that's how we're able to relate to
the kids that's how we're able to relate
to a whole lot of stuff on the street
that we deal with because we've been
there we've done that we know what's
going on but they don't realize that the
program could also harm some they're
convinced of the program's success out
of around 750 children seven had serious
problems with the law afterwards back in
prison
we also notice a change the mood is more
relaxed
then it's time for the children to be
left with the real inmates some of them
are even in for murder the ugly truth
[Music]
I'm known as big dream to become a
professional football player
go to college please oh by the way Louis
teacher what have you liked me
we've been treating all things not they
could even write it at all you can do
the street is not the life you want
Amelia
[Music]
the meeting leaves its mark on the boys
[Music]
pertaining to a little boy that I were
to Elaine
J the whole ed to
the last task for the kids is to write a
letter to their parents including you
along with a list of
and to do
encouragement is also part of the
weekend
[Music]
as the children write their letters
deputy board and the others make some
time for them they share above all their
personal experiences as a Mimi
people-powered saying EPP you owe it you
got me to see a different map
Nola's conclusion to the weekend the
kids are almost done
[Music]
Sunday morning 6 o'clock
Cortney than the other parents come to
pick up their children you can sense the
tension did Noah learn anything from
this weekend
you did it on the fire
I am sorry for
the parents are relieved and so are the
children is that just because the
weekend is over
a weekend in jail for an eight-year-old
is that really necessary from the
community a different intricacies I was
linear accurately have done different
things before it sold its basically
changing Deandra seems reflexive
Kourtney seems relieved
the method is questionable but at least
the policeman really seemed to care
about the children
and for them to a long weekend comes to
an end
[Music]
