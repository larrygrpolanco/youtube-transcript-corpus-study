my mom is in town because our wedding is
only eight days away and her being here
really got me thinking about all the
times I pranked her with fake Starbucks
it's genuinely been years since I've
treated her to a real Starbucks so today
that's exactly what we're gonna do we're
gonna trick her by getting her actuals
it's perfect because today we're running
a ton of wedding errands anyways we're
at Target and we went to that store of
course Grace wanted it on this too
because I mean we've been doing this for
years now she was a little hesitant
because we've really made her some gross
concoctions but I had to get the pink
drink because that's the first copycat
recipe we ever did
