it's Christmas Eve and we're getting
ready to go to some of our family
parties Grace was inspired by all the
presents under the Christmas tree that
we're gonna do bows in her hair like
we're turning her hair into bows I've
never actually done this before but I
saw a Pinterest video so I think I'm
good I first put two buns in her hair
and then I'm braiding the rest and then
separate the bun and then put the braid
over and around it if that makes sense
and then I secure it with another hair
tie it was actually really really simple
and it turned out so cute we actually
did end up putting bows in her hair too
Grace what do you think I love it
