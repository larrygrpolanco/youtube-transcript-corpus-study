my mom woke me up way too early today I
said hell no I'm going back to bed but
then I remembered that there's less
competitions dumpster diving in the
morning so that was enough to get me out
of bed this has a rule where I
have to shower after I dumpster dive
which is just ridiculous so
obviously I had to go sit in another
garbage can after I took a shower I
asked really nicely if I could get into
the Forbidden cupboard today to which
she said no I started practicing the
trajectory of my to give her pink
eye and then because mom forced me to
get out of bed I had to force Dad to get
out of bed and violence is the only
answer to get him out of bed but don't
worry we made up after W he said he'd
open the cupboard for me when Mom's not
home so I took that as a victory and ate
some corn in my emotional support coffee
pot and oh my God my mom ducked up her
shoulder at the gym recently so she got
this machine but come on we both know
what we're thinking this does and you
want to know what pissed me off today my
dad brought my mom strawberries and
 flowers where are the bird
toys when the sun's down I will strike
