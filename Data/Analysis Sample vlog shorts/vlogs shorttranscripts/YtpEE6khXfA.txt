I would be a lie if I said my first year
of college flew by it didn't at least
not for the most part but now it's over
I definitely learned a lot most of which
being outside the lecture Halls like
audible maybe earth's greatest creation
not sponsored or how everything costs
money everything
but I also realized how much I took for
granted what I had at home
just physically being with your family
is criminally underrated and it's really
nice not have to take my wallet and key
if I want to use the back bathroom
or run
or eat
but you can always just eat out it's
dope knowing your friends are probably
having the same experience feeling the
same things but you're back and they're
back so now you can finally hang out
or you can just go out in general
while I'm not necessarily excited to go
back I'm definitely not dreading the
fall either college is cool
but there's really no place like all
