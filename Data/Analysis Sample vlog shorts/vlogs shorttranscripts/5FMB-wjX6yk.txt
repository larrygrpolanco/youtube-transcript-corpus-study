this is my Vlog camera it's the DJI
pocket 2. I like using it when I travel
because it's super tiny but so powerful
it shoots up to 4K and already has a
default wide angle view the footage
comes out very stable because of its
built-in gimbal it can flip from front
to back facing with just two clicks it
can zoom in and it has lots of other
settings like shooting in manual
shooting in a flat color profile or
connecting to the mobile app it can even
take photos and you can review all the
content on the device as well it also
comes in white I got mine for 500 with
the Creator combo kit but without it
it's 350.
