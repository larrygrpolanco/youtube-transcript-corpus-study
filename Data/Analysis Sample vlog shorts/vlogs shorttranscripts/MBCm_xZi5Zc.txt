come with me to pick up my six-year-old
after having a rough week at school now
normally on Fridays I bring her a gas
station tree because that's what my mom
always did when we were growing up but
after the week she's had which I will
not get into I knew this girl needed
something more yeah she asked me to take
a video of her being a manager we got
her a drink we got her a pretzel extra
salted of course and her move was
already shifting we did a little window
shopping we sampled like everything
because that's what me and my friends
did Growing I'm not even sure why it's
so much fun because you come out
smelling like a perfume bottle and this
just proves it does not take much to
lift somebody up
