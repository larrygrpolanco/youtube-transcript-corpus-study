we are in sari sarga which is on the
Arctic Circle and we're hoping to catch
the northern lights today
let's see if we get to see them
[Music]
look at this fresh snow
[Music]
we were going on snow scooters in the
middle of the night minus 15 degrees so
we had to wear these intense suits and
helmet and this look like we were on a
moon Expedition and we went in the
middle of the snow-covered Forest
stopped at random spots and this is what
we saw
super rare to catch the northern lights
in your first visit we were so lucky
