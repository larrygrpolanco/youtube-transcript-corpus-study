hello everybody and welcome to a study
Vlog I had completely forgotten his lock
upload karna so this is a quite old Vlog
of the last month probably I was
studying Community medicine because my
ward leave was just in two or three days
and I had this amazing Podi idli which
was very very good I had it for the very
first time
I sat for another three four hour
session and I make sure that I keep
myself hydrated throughout
I took a shower again and I did some
night skin care and I again started to
study and dinner Kia and yeah that's
about it I hope you enjoyed this one and
I'll see you in the next one bye
