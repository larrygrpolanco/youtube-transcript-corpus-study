Japan knife factor it's what I gotta
wear to work
okay let's get started
first we got a wild Sunday night
together now that it's well lived
together how did you do that
freaky and hardened the knives
straighten
add the handle buff sharp and polish and
test the blade I freaking killed that
durability desk
indestructible tough day at the factory
For Better or For Worse we bought a 50
banana food like that you get ripped off
sucks
