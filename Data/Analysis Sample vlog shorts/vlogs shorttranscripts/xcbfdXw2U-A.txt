I had probably wasted hundreds of
dollars at this point on clothes that I
would buy my daughter and she would not
wear so I officially quit and I'm having
her do all the shopping seriously the
amount of money I would have saved if
she would have just bought her clothes
from the beginning first up obviously we
went to her favorite stores and we got
two outfits and accessories of course
first outfit was very on brand ballerina
inspired obviously but it's also like on
Trend because I see so many people
rocking the leg warmer you're gonna have
to give this outfit a 10 out of 10
because she crushed it I mean seriously
stunning for the second outfit she got a
matching set you cannot go wrong with
matching sets and she looks adorable
