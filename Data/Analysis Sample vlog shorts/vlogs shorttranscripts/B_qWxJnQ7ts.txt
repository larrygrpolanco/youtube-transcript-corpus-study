I genuinely feel like I'm pregnant now
I'm only two days late for my period
which honestly is not abnormal if you
couldn't tell I'm basically spiraling at
this point and need to know either way
so let's go take a pregnancy test I have
not been pregnant in like seven years
I've been a single mom up until December
of 2022 when I got married so honestly
it feels so weird even walking down the
side and like going through this process
I guess like I forgot how to take a
pregnancy test like I know they're dummy
poop but I felt like I was gonna do it
wrong my full reaction is live on our
