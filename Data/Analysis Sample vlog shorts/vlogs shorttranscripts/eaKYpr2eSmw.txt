my six-year-old woke up 45 minutes
earlier than she normally does now the
last time she did this she was trying to
impress him but he wanted to take extra
time in the morning to get ready so I
just asked her straight up girl to girl
like what's going on today how can I
help not my husband being the most
obnoxious morning person but we love him
anyways Grace ended up saying that the
last time we did this she loved it and
she loved doing it for herself rather
than trying to impress her actual tears
welled up in my eyes cause let's be real
this girl had no one to impress about
herself
