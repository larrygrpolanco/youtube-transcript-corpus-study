welcome to a day in my life as a mom of
three and a full-time content creator it
was a microwave pancake type morning my
middle was not having it until she had
food and then she was happy again I go
to the gym after I drop Hayden off in
the mornings and Gerard deals with the
little ones
did you hear that Emmett learned how to
say how are you and we think it's the
cutest thing ever then I got home from
the gym got ready had breakfast did my
makeup and today we tried to make these
little homemade fruit snacks which I'm
gonna let you see how that worked out
for us
[Music]
so as you can see I'm not sure what went
wrong but something definitely went
wrong better luck next time then I took
my lunch on the go and headed to a curly
hair salon to get the girls some hip
hugs
