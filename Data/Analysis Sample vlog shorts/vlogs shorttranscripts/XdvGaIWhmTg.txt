today my six-year-old asked for soccer
hair I'm not quite sure what that looks
like but today's her first ever soccer
so we're gonna go for a look that keeps
her hair out of her face first thing
that came to mind was french braids but
I'm not that good at French braiding
hair it did take me a couple tries and I
was pulling her hair a little bit so I
felt bad but thankfully she ended up
loving it because we can't be late to
her first ever soccer and she was so
excited
