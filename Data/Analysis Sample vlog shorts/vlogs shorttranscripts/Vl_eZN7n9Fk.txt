I got invited to the Grammys after I got
ready Google sent a car to my house and
drove me straight to the red carpet I
had an obligatory robot moment and then
got some cool photos taken by the
paparazzi I felt like a movie star I got
to do a spin in front of a robot arm
which was a dream come true then I went
to the arena this place was huge
obligatory robot moment I was invited to
the special Google Suite which had free
food so of course I stayed there the
whole night then the show started
what do you think
when it was over I went to the after
party and I'll just let past me describe
what I thought about it there's
butterfly men
what is going on
